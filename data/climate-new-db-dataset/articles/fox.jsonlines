Biden appears to have raised climate change to the level of a religious doctrine.In naming John Kerry a climate \"czar,\" Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., to head the Dept. of the Interior -- if confirmed Haaland would become the first Native American cabinet secretary in history, a diversity priority for Biden -- and Michael Regan, head of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality, who would be the first Black man to lead  (ditto on diversity), Biden has signaled he is all-in on using government to change the climate, which some believe is already improving because of technology and innovation in the private sector.Here is a fundamental question: If  thinks government has the power to change the climate (it doesn't), why hasn't government been able to prevent hurricanes and other natural disasters? is being used by politicians -- nearly all of them Democrats -- to erode our liberties. If given the power to dictate what we drive, the type of house we can live in and other freedoms we have long taken for granted, government will not be able to resist adding even more demands in the name of saving the planet.At the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, climate change disciples laid out their vision for America's future. By 2030, some forecast:-- The U.S. will not be the world's leading superpower.-- A billion people will be displaced by climate change.-- Polluters will have to pay to emit carbon dioxide.-- There will be a global price on carbon (and) this will help make fossil fuels history.If these initiatives are enacted, it will turn the United States into something other than what we have enjoyed for two centuries.Some comments by the Davos attendees dismissed the notion that a majority of citizens should decide such crucial matters, leaving decisions instead to unaccountable elites.This is the stuff of dictatorship, little different from what communist leaders have done in the past, and in the present in China.President-elect Biden has called climate change a \"crisis.\" How many crises can we deal with at one time?I thought COVID-19 was a crisis. How about getting that under control before we start addressing climate, which is changing, but for the better in some\u00a0places and probably in the U.S.According to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based autonomous intergovernmental organization \"committed to shaping a secure and sustainable energy future for all,\" \"The United States saw the largest decline in energy-related CO2 emissions in 2019 on a country basis - a fall of 140 Mt, or 2.9 percent, to 4.8 Gt. U.S. emissions are now down almost 1 Gt from their peak in the year 2000, the largest absolute decline by any country over that period.\"Opinion polls have been all over the place on this issue. Prior to the election, an NPR/PBS News Hour Marist poll found climate change taking over the top spot of concerns for Democrats. The economy remained the number one issue for Republicans with climate change not registering among those polled.The media will join politicians and some \"experts\" to promote climate change during the Biden administration, including end-of-the-world scenarios with little or no scientific information that contradicts their line. Two years ago, \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd announced he would not have any guests on who doubted climate change. This is censorship and the promotion of a single point of view constitutes indoctrination.Implementing the Biden climate doctrine will cost a fortune and result in an outcome most Americans will not like.Cal Thomas is one of America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist in the U.S.\u00a0He is the author of several books.

{"id": null, "body": "\n        The forthcoming cover of a massive climate-change report, compiled every six years by an arm of the United Nations. Friday, the world was treated to the latest, greatest report on global warming from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the form of its . It is an embarrassment of internal inconsistency, entirely self-serving, and is beyond misleading.That\u2019s because the IPCC is more intent on maintaining the crumbling \u201cconsensus\u201d on global warming than on following climate science to its logical conclusion; a conclusion that increasingly suggests that human greenhouse gas emissions are less important in driving climate change than commonly held.That\u2019s right, the latest climate science (some 10 studies published in just the past 3 years) indicates that the earth\u2019s climate sensitivity\u2014that is, how much the global average surface temperature will rise as a result of greenhouse gases emitted from human activities\u2014is some 33 percent  than scientists thought at the time of the last IPCC Assessment, published in 2007.A little climate 101: climate sensitivity is one of the key parameters for understanding the future impacts from climate change.[pullquote]Virtually all elements of climate are related in some way to changes in the earth\u2019s average temperature.The less the earth warms up, the fewer the resulting impacts, and the lower the urgency to try to do something to alleviate them.Meaning, initiatives like President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan\u2014the motivation for such things as the EPA\u2019s just-announced effective moratorium on future coal-fired power plants\u2014would be even more unnecessary and ineffective than they are already.The IPCC is not altogether blind to the new scientific findings indicating a lower climate sensitivity, but it barely pays them lip-service in its new report.It can\u2019t.Why?The meat of the new IPCC report \u2013 and the part that politicians predominantly look to for new legislation \u2013\u00a0 is its projections of future climate change.The problem is that the climate models the IPCC relies upon to produce these projections have a climate sensitivity that averages some  than what the latest science suggests.This means that the IPCC\u2019s projections of future climate change and the resulting impacts are nearly twice as large as they likely should be. In other words, the models don\u2019t work.The IPCC can\u2019t very well admit to the fact that observations say one thing, but the climate models say another. If they did, they would have to throw out virtually the whole report.But just because the IPCC doesn\u2019t admit to it, doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t know it to be true.It is increasingly obvious that the earth\u2019s average temperature over the past several decades has refused to warm up at the rate foretold by these climate models.In fact, there has been no clear large-scale surface warming for more than 16 years now, and a new paper published earlier this month in the prestigious journal Nature Climate Change affirms the climate models inability to correctly simulate these observations.So we have a situation in which the latest science on two key issues: how much the earth will warm as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions, and how well climate models perform in projecting the warming, is largely not incorporated into the new IPCC report.In this manner, the IPCC misleads policymakers around the world.The IPCC\u2019s exaggerated projections are the root of fears of coming climate disaster (sinking cities, storm-ravaged coastlines, widespread famine, etc.)\u2014fears that result in calls to limit our use of fossil fuels used to produce the energy that supports human society and feeds innovation.If mankind is to contemplate such a major undertaking with the attached risk that it drives the human condition backward, shouldn\u2019t the basis be something other than an IPCC report that is obsolete and counterfactual on the day of its release?Instead of laboring to try to uphold a consensus that was tenuous from the outset, and which is now outdated, the IPCC should be striving to produce a summary of the contemporary bank of scientific knowledge. Only with that type of information can responsible decisions pertaining to the development of world\u2019s energy sources be made.", "headline": "UN's new climate change report an embarrassment, self-serving and beyond misleading", "article_name": "uns-new-climate-change-report-an-embarrassment-self-serving-and-beyond-misleading", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/uns-new-climate-change-report-an-embarrassment-self-serving-and-beyond-misleading", "date_published": "2015-05-08 00:00:00", "article_length": 4275, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:08.943507"}

The annual average of 86 tropical cyclones is projected to decrease to about 69 worldwide by the end of the 21st century.\"Declines are projected in most regions except in the Central Pacific, including Hawaii, where tropical cyclones activity is expected to increase,\" according to NOAA.But while there may be fewer storms, many of the cyclones that form are expected to be \"significantly more severe\" due to rising sea surface temperatures that fuel the .The city has installed temporary barriers along its waterfront to prevent future storm surges, but more permanent solutions are currently under consideration; Rick Leventhal reports.\u201cWe hope this research provides information to help decision-makers understand the forces driving tropical cyclone patterns and make plans accordingly to protect lives and infrastructure,\u201d Murakami said.While the NOAA Climate Prediction Center will provide its initial seasonal outlook for the Atlantic basin in May,\u00a0\u00a0are\u00a0\u00a0this year,\u00a0citing the likely absence of El Ni\u00f1o as a primary factor.The 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, and\u00a0: Arthur, Bertha, Cristobal, Dolly, Edouard, Fay, Gonzalo, Hanna, Isaias, Josephine, Kyle, Laura, Marco, Nana, Omar, Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy, Vicky, and Wilfred.", "headline": "Climate change is influencing where tropical cyclones happen most frequently, study says", "article_name": "climate-change-tropical-cyclone-hurricane-typhoon-tropical-storm-noaa-study-weather-atlantic-pacific-indian-ocean", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/climate-change-tropical-cyclone-hurricane-typhoon-tropical-storm-noaa-study-weather-atlantic-pacific-indian-ocean", "date_published": "2020-05-07 00:00:00", "article_length": 5033, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:10.837350"}

{"id": null, "body": "   Deep in the jagged red mountains of Oman, geologists are drilling in search of the holy grail of reversing climate change: an efficient and cheap way to remove carbon dioxide from the air and oceans.They are coring samples from one of the world's only exposed sections of the Earth's mantle to uncover how a spontaneous natural process millions of years ago transformed CO2 into limestone and marble.As the world mobilizes to confront climate change, the main focus has been on reducing emissions through fuel efficient cars and cleaner power plants. But some researchers are also testing ways to remove or recycle carbon already in the seas and sky.The Hellisheidi geothermal plant in Iceland injects carbon into volcanic rock. At the massive Sinopec fertilizer plant in China, CO2 is filtered and reused as fuel. In all, 16 industrial projects currently capture and store around 27 million tons of CO2, according to the International Energy Agency. That's less than 0.1 percent of global emissions \u2014 but the technology has shown promise.\"Any one technique is not guaranteed to succeed,\" said Stuart Haszeldine, a geology professor at the University of Edinburgh who serves on a U.N. climate body studying how to reduce atmospheric carbon.\"If we're interested as a species, we've got to try a lot harder and do a lot more and a lot of different actions,\" he said.One such action is underway in the al-Hajjar Mountains of Oman, in a quiet corner of the Arabian Peninsula, where a unique rock formation pulls carbon out of thin air.Peter Kelemen, a 61-year-old geochemist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, has been exploring Oman's hills for nearly three decades. \"You can walk down these beautiful canyons and basically descend 20 kilometers (12 miles) into the earth's interior,\" he said.The sultanate boasts the largest exposed sections of the Earth's mantle, thrust up by plate tectonics millions of years ago. The mantle contains peridotite, a rock that reacts with the carbon in air and water to form marble and limestone.\"Every single magnesium atom in these rocks has made friends with the carbon dioxide to form solid limestone, magnesium carbonate, plus quartz,\" he said as he patted a rust-colored boulder in the Wadi Mansah valley.\"There's about a billion tons of CO2 in this mountain,\" he said, pointing off to the east.Rain and springs pull carbon from the exposed mantle to form stalactites and stalagmites in mountain caves. Natural pools develop surface scum of white carbonate. Scratch off this thin white film, Kelemen said, and it'll grow back in a day.\"For a geologist this is supersonic,\" he said.He and a team of 40 scientists have formed the Oman Drilling Project in order to better understand how that process works and whether it could be used to scrub the earth's carbon-laden atmosphere. The $3.5 million project has support from across the globe, including NASA.Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas driving climate change, which threatens political instability, severe weather and food insecurity worldwide, according to the United Nations climate body.Natural CO2 levels have risen from 280 to 405 parts per million since the Industrial Revolution, and current estimates hold that the world will be 6 C hotter by 2100.In 2015, 196 nations signed the Paris climate accords, agreeing to curb greenhouse gas emissions to levels that would keep the rise in the Earth's temperature to under 2 C.That has injected new urgency into the work underway in Oman, where Keleman's team recently spent four months extracting dozens of core samples, which they hope to use to construct a geological history of the process that turns CO2 into carbonate.\"It's like a jigsaw puzzle,\" said Nehal Warsi, 33, who oversees the drilling process.Around 13 tons of core samples from four different sites will be sent to the Chikyu, a state-of-the-art research vessel off the coast of Japan, where Keleman and other geologists will analyze them in round-the-clock shifts.They hope to answer the question of how the rocks managed to capture so much CO2 over the course of 90 million years \u2014 and to see if there's a way to speed up the timetable.Kelemen thinks a drilling operation could cycle carbon-rich water into the newly formed seabed on oceanic ridges far below the surface. Just like in Oman's mountains, the submerged rock would chemically absorb carbon from the water. The water could then be cycled back to the surface to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere, in a sort of conveyor belt.Such a project would require years more of testing, but Kelemen hopes the energy industry, with its offshore drilling expertise and deep pockets, will take interest.\"Ultimately, if the goal is to capture billions and billions of tons of carbon, that's where James Cameron comes in,\" he said, half joking, referring to the \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\" director who has also pioneered undersea technology. Cameron himself piloted a submersible to the deepest point on Earth in 2012 and retrieved samples while filming \"Deepsea Challenge.\"\"He hasn't responded to my messages yet,\" Kelemen said.", "headline": "Scientists seek holy grail of climate change in Oman's hills", "article_name": "scientists-seek-holy-grail-of-climate-change-in-omans-hills", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/scientists-seek-holy-grail-of-climate-change-in-omans-hills", "date_published": "2017-04-17 00:00:00", "article_length": 5119, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:14.160744"}

(Credit: Elin Vinje Jenssen/Norsk Polarinstitutt) Researchers recently found more than 200 dead reindeer on the island of Svalbard in Norway; the animals starved to death due to climate change, which is disrupting their access to the plants that they typically eat.Every year, ecologists with the Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) survey reindeer populations in Svalbard, an archipelago of glaciers and frozen tundra that lies between Norway and the North Pole.The findings from the scientists' 10-week investigation were grim: Reindeer population numbers were down, and the individual animals were much thinner than they should have been. And hundreds of reindeer carcasses showed signs of starvation,\u00a0\u00a0on July 27. []\"It's scary to find so many dead animals,\" \u00c5shild \u00d8nvik Pedersen, an NPI terrestrial ecologist, told NRK. Reindeer in Svalbard are a subspecies,\u00a0Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus,\u00a0and they are short-legged, with endearingly small, rounded heads. Males are slightly larger than females, measuring about 5 feet (1.6 meters) long and weighing up to 198 lbs. (90 kilograms),\u00a0.Climate change is bringing warmer temperatures to Svalbard, which means more precipitation. And heavy rainfall in December is thought to be responsible for the unusually high number of reindeer deaths, the researchers wrote on May 28\u00a0.After the December rain hit the ground, the precipitation froze, creating \"tundra ice caps,\" a thick layer of ice that prevented\u00a0\u00a0from reaching vegetation in their usual winter grazing pastures. This forced the animals to dig pits in shoreline snow to find seaweed and kelp, which are less nutritious than the reindeer's usual fare.The scientists also observed reindeer grazing on cliffs, which the animals rarely do during winters when food is more plentiful. Rocky, mountainous regions\u00a0\u00a0don't have much plant life, and this \"mountain goat strategy\" is risky for the reindeer, because the cliffs are very steep. But during lean years, about 50% of the reindeer climb to altitudes of nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) in a desperate search for food, the researchers reported.With their pastures locked in ice, the reindeer also have to travel farther to find food. And when there is little to eat, the youngest and oldest animals are usually the first to die, Pedersen told NRK.\"Some of the mortality is natural because there were so many calves last year,\" she said.\u00a0\"But the large number we see now is due to heavy rainfall, which is\u00a0.\"", "headline": "More than 200 reindeer found dead in Norway, starved by climate change", "article_name": "more-than-200-reindeer-found-dead-in-norway-starved-by-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/more-than-200-reindeer-found-dead-in-norway-starved-by-climate-change", "date_published": "2019-07-30 00:00:00", "article_length": 2647, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:16.939916"}

The Los Angeles Times reported in 2009 on\u00a0a government ecologist's prediction\u00a0that all of Montana's glaciers would be gone in 2020.\u00a0The reality? As recently as\u00a0January, Montana's Glacier National Park was reportedly\u00a0replacing signs with that very warning.CNN : \"In 2017, the park was told by the agency that the complete melting off of the glaciers was no longer expected to take place so quickly due to changes in the forecast model, [park spokeswoman Gina] Kurzmen said. But tight maintenance budgets made it impossible for the park to immediately change the signs.\"Other reports relayed predictions that \"Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past\" (The Independent in\u00a02000), \"Snows of Kilimanjaro to Vanish by 2020\" (The Vancouver Sun in 2008), and \"Arctic summers may be ice free by 2020\" (Lancaster Eagle-Gazette in 2013).As JunkScience.com's report notes, the Artctic still had\u00a0plenty of ice in September, and the famous African volcano\u00a0had\u00a0defied former Vice President\u00a0Al Gore's 2006 prediction that\u00a0\"within a decade, there will be no more snows of Kilimanjaro.\"Meanwhile, Florida has maintained a sea level rise of less than 4 inches, despite an earlier prediction it could see an increase of\u00a02 feet\u00a0by 2020.\u00a0In 1987, the Star-Phoenix reported on NASA scientist James Hansen's warning that by the end of the 90s, average global temperature increases would reach between one-half and 1\u00a0degree Celsius.\u00a0After quoting Hansen predicting unprecedented warmth in the following decades, the paper said: \"If this proves true, by the year 2020 we will experience an average temperature increase of around three degrees, with even greater extremes.\" It also noted that \"more conservative scientists believe a change list this will not happen until the middle of the 21st Century.\"While the climate for 2050\u00a0is unknown, 2020 has already turned out slightly better than Hansen predicted. Data obtained by JunkScience.com\u00a0showed the global average temperature was\u00a0higher by\u00a00.44 degrees Celsius.The increase in global CO2 concentration (about 23% from 1978 to 2020) also fell short of a prediction that it would double by 2020. \"We learn that if present trends continue, with economics the only limit on the exploitation of fossil fuels, the CO2 concentration will have doubled by 2020,\" said\u00a0a 1978\u00a0article in The\u00a0Vancouver Sun.Predictions like these are often held up as evidence that alarmist predictions about climate change shouldn't be taken seriously. However, these arguments have encountered pushback from critics who argue that some climate models were accurate, and discrepancies can at least partially be attributed to the types of regulations activists are seeking as a response to warming.It's unclear just how effective those regulations have been. In 2019, the United Nations released a global assessment of environmental rules and noted that .Heartland Institute Director Steve Milloy, who also runs JunkScience.com, told Fox News that the push for policy interventions has failed.\"The world has\u00a0spent\u00a0trillions on climate without any obvious benefit\u00a0\u2014 to the\u00a0environment, climate, public\u00a0health, or economy,\" he said. from Yale University, however, argued that environmental regulations have curbed emissions even as the U.S. saw a \"substantial increase in manufacturing output\" from 1990 to 2008.At end of last year, researchers from NASA, the University of California, Berkeley, and the Massachussetts Institute of Technology released\u00a0a study on climate models published between 1970 and 2007.\"We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO2\u00a0and other climate drivers,\" the group said.\u00a0The study specifically looked at 17\u00a0models, finding that 10 closely matched observations. That number  to 14 when the researchers accounted for differences between modeled and actual changes in carbon dioxide.\u00a0The Heartland Institute has  criticism over its funding, which has included money from ExxonMobil. The right-leaning think tank does not publicly identify its donors but\u00a0defends itself by  that while donors can influence their research agenda, they \"do not surrender control over the peer review process.\"It also claims that \"[d]uring 2019, The Heartland Institute raised approximately $4.6\u00a0million in support from approximately 2,000 individual, foundation, and corporate supporters. Its 2019\u00a0income came from the following sources: Foundations 67%, individuals 27%, corporations 5%.

While environmentalists see logging as an exploitation of the environment, logging actually serves a key role in removing extra lumber that can build up and increase the risk of devastating fires.By \"eco-imperialism,\" Ebell told Fox News, he means that \"the support for locking things up and not using them is really based on the fact that most of the decision-makers live in urban areas and they don\u2019t know what the forests need but they believe that locking them up is the way to preserve the environment.\"'The federal government actually controls the rural economies of the Western states,\" the analyst explained. While the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service \"believed in the productive use of the resources \u2013 timber, mining, oil and gas production\" for decades, these agencies have severely restricted that use since the 1990s.In 1990, Ebell said, the Forest Service cut about 12 billion board-feet of timber per year, while the national forests under its purview added about 17 billion board-feet of timber per year. After the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the northern spotted owl on the endangered species list in 1990, agencies started to restrict logging in national forests. By 2008 or 2009, the Forest Service was only cutting about 1 billion board-feet of timber per year.Logging increased slightly under President Barack Obama, and the Trump administration aimed to increase logging to 4 billion board-feet in the first term, then 8 billion in a hypothetical second term. The Biden administration has pledged to decrease logging once again.\u00a0Even Trump's turnaround proved difficult, since most of the sawmills had closed, Ebell explained. About 175 sawmills closed in the 1990s.Due to the decrease in logging, the analyst explained, California's forests have experienced a huge fuel build-up, and during times of drought, trees become susceptible to insects and disease, leaving \"hundreds of millions of dead trees.\"Regular fires fulfill a vital role in a forest ecosystem, clearing out excess brush and helping some seeds to sprout, while leaving many large trees intact. Yet when fuel builds up, and dead trees pile on one another, \"there's no green stuff to keep the fire down,\" Ebell explained.\"Going down from 12 billion board-feet to 2 billion board-feet has not only destroyed these areas economically,\" the analyst told Fox News. \"There\u2019s a big difference between just a forest fire and what we\u2019re having now. This build-up leads to very hot fires, catastrophic fires, and it will burn everything. These fires even scorch the soil \u2013 they are incredibly destructive to the environment.\"Ebell dismissed the idea that climate change explains these destructive fires. \"Having the outside temperature be five degrees higher than last year won\u2019t make an impact on a fire that\u2019s a hundred degrees hotter than it should be,\" he told Fox News.Ebell also faulted the Forest Service for banning firefighting during the night \u2013 when temperatures are cooler. He also noted that federal regulations disincentivize controlled burns, one of the best ways to reduce fuel in a forest. While fires do not count as emissions under the Clean Air Act, controlled burns do., a geologist and executive director of the CO2 Coalition, also briefed reporters on the call concerning the California wildfires.\"Th current western drought has been called unusual and unprecedented,\" Wrightstone noted. \"This is categorically false. There were many other periods in the southwestern United States that experienced worse draughts.\" He mentioned the  that drove the Anasazi people from the Southwest.Steve Milloy, a former Trump-Pence EPA transition member and founder of JunkScience.com, compared the carbon emissions from the California fires with the carbon emissions that California has decreased through its cap-and-trade system since 2012.The cap-and-trade system \u2013 which Milloy noted, \"cost consumers and businesses billions and billions of dollars\" \u2013 reduced emissions by approximately 180 million tons.

Here are 10 of the biggest doomsday prediction failures:In 1989, the Associated Press relayed a warning from a U.N. official:\"A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.\"The official was Noel Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, who added: \"Shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s Dust Bowl conditions to Canadian and U.S. wheatlands.\u201dInstead, U.S. and global farm production rose, and more than 1 billion people worldwide rose out of extreme poverty due to economic growth.No nations were \u201cwiped off the face of the Earth\u201d as of 2019.However, those worried about warming caution that the U.N. official\u2019s prediction was nuanced.\u201cHe is not saying that entire nations are going to be wiped off the face of the earth by the year 2000,\u201d Joe Romm, a senior fellow at American Progress, told Fox News.\u201cHe is saying that if we don\u2019t dramatically reverse emissions by the year 2000 \u2014 then we are not going to be able to avoid future flooding,\u201d Romm said.\u201cIt now seems inevitable that a number of island nations will be wiped off the face of the earth because we didn\u2019t act in time,\u201d he added.According to , global sea levels rose 3.5 inches in the 25 years since 1993, when it began reporting satellite data on sea levels.The world\u2019s lowest-lying country is the Maldives, a collection of Pacific islands with a population of just over 400,000, where the highest point in the country is 7.9 feet above sea level, with much of it below 3 feet.In 1967, a best-selling book came out called \u201c\u201dIt predicted mass starvation around the developing world due to increasing population. \u201cToday\u2019s crisis can move in only one direction \u2013 toward catastrophe,\u201d it warned.Some experts praised the book and ridiculed doubters.\u201cAll serious students of the plight of the underdeveloped nations agree that famine... is inevitable,\u201d Cal Tech biology professor Peter Bonner wrote in a 1967 review of the book in the prestigious journal Science.The exact opposite of the book\u2019s prediction happened. Famine deaths plunged dramatically as farming technology improved, communist countries began allowing private property again, and the globe became further connected.According to a dataset put together by , more people died of famine in the single decade prior to the book\u2019s release than in all 52 years since it was published.Yet the book got widespread praise from experts. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich, now President of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University, said in 1968 that the book \u201cmay be remembered as one of the most important books of our age.\u201dGlobal cooling was once a worry to many, such as University of California at Davis professor Kenneth Watt, who  that present trends would make the world \u201celeven degrees colder in the year 2000 ... about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.\u201dBritish science writer Nigel Calder was just as worried. \"The threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for mankind,\u201d Calder warned in International Wildlife magazine in 1975.That quote was dug up by George Mason University economist Walter E. Williams, who argues that there are so many apocalyptic predictions because \u201cthey have an agenda for more government control ... fear about the environment is a way to gain government control,\u201d Williams told Fox News.\u201cCommunism and socialism have lost respectability, so it\u2019s been repackaged as environmentalism,\u201d he added.\u201cIt\u2019s like watermelons \u2014\u00a0green on the outside, red on the inside.\u201dThe same U.N. official who predicted the loss of entire nations by the year 2000 also claimed: \"the most conservative scientific estimate [is] that the Earth\u2019s temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years.\u201dBut looking back from 2019, the temperature rose about half of a degree\u00a0Celsius since 1989, according to .Romm says that, regardless of what that U.N. official may have said, the projections issued in the U.N.\u2019s official reports have been good.\u201cAll of the major scientific assessments of global warming have become more dire over time because greenhouse gas emissions have until very recently kept rising at a worst-case scenario rate,\u201d Romm said.Many who worry about global warming acknowledge that some past predictions have been overblown, but say they hope that doesn\u2019t distract people from the reality that the earth is warming due to man \u2013 if more slowly and less catastrophically than some have predicted.\u201cThere have been predictions that have turned out not to come true,\u201d John P. Abraham, a Professor at the University of St. Thomas who has published papers on climate change, told Fox News. \u201cBut ... the majority of climate science was proven right.\u201dIn 2006, while promoting his movie \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d, Al Gore  that humanity had only 10 years left before the world would reach a point of no return.Gore\u2019s movie also featured animations of water inundating Manhattan and Florida.Yet Gore\u2019s critics point out that just a few years later, he  an $8 million beach-front property near Los Angeles.\u201cI wish the climate catastrophists practiced what they preached and sold me their beachfront property at a steep discount,\u201d Alex Epstein, author of\u00a0\u201cThe Moral Case for Fossil Fuels\u201d told Fox News.In 1982, U.N. official Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the UN Environment Program, warned:\u201cBy the turn of the century, an environmental catastrophe will witness devastation as complete, as irreversible, as any nuclear holocaust.\u201dNo such disaster occurred.In 1970, Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wisc.,\u00a0\u2013 often considered the \u201cfather of Earth Day\u201d \u2013 cited the secretary of the Smithsonian, who \u201cbelieves that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.\u201dThat did not happen.A 2011  from the National Science Foundation quotes researcher Anthony Barnosky at UC Berkeley, who said: \"So far, only 1 to 2 percent of all species have gone extinct in the groups we can look at clearly, so by those numbers it looks like we are not far down the road to extinction.\u201dBarnosky still expressed concern over a long time horizon, saying that 75 percent of species could go extinct \u201cin as little as 3 to 22 centuries.\u201dScientist Harrison Brown predicted in Scientific American that lead, zinc, tin, gold and silver deposits would be fully depleted before 1990.But mining companies found new technologies and reserves, such that by 2019, none of those minerals were near depletion.Economist Walter E. Williams says environmentalists have occasionally tipped their hand about what motivates their predictions.\"We have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have,\u201d Stephen Schneider, a professor of Biology at Stanford University, said to Discover magazine in 1989. \u201cEach of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.\u201dWilliams also cites Sen.\u00a0Timothy Wirth, a Democrat from Colorado, who said in 1988: \"We've got to ... try to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong ... we will be doing the right thing anyway in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.\"Williams finds the exaggerated predictions of some environmentalists unacceptable.\u201cLying is never OK. To mislead people is never OK,\u201d he told Fox News.\u201cYou can mislead kids and tell them there is Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.

{"id": null, "body": "\n        As snow-weary Pennsylvanians dug out, utilities struggled to restore power to thousands and crews worked to reopen closed roads after a record-breaking blizzard that dumped more than a foot of snow across the state. Scientists and politicians on both sides of the climate change debate have been pointing to the record-breaking snowstorms in the Mid-Atlantic states to promote their theories on the earth's changing temperatures -- and the debate is getting downright nasty.Joseph Romm, a climate change expert and former Energy Department official; Jeff Masters, a meteorologist who writes on the  and others argue that this winter's snowstorms are, counterintuitively, evidence of global warming and not cooling.\"It's absurd for the 'anti-science side' to say we're in a cooling trend when we're in an overall warming trend,\" says Romm of the , a liberal think tank. \"Heavy snow is not evidence that climate science is false,\" he added, noting that \"the snow we've seen is entirely consistent with global warming theory.\"But Patrick J. Michaels, senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute and state climatologist for Virginia for 27 years, disagrees. \"Global warming simply hasn't done a darned thing to Washington's snow,\" he wrote on addingthat \"if you plot out year-to-year snow around here, you'll see no trend whatsoever through the entire history.\"Politicians are jumping on the bandwagon, too. \"It's going to keep snowing in DC until  cries 'uncle,'\"  Sen. , R-S.C.Global warming advocates feel under attack as skeptics use the record-setting snowstorms -- and the recent discoveries of errors in the U.N.'s climate science study, a growing scandal called climate-gate -- to question the theory that climate change is a manmade problem.Romm explains that cold weather doesn't cause snow. What brings the flakes down is a combination of cold and precipitation. And since warmer air holds more moisture, global warming and heavy snowfall can coexist, so long as temperatures keeping dipping below 32 degrees., agrees, going so far as to tell MSNBC's  that scientists who doubt climate change's manmade origins are unpatriotic. \"If you want to get serious about it, these guys claiming that the snow in Washington disproves\u00a0climate change are almost unpatriotic -- it's as if they're denying science,\" Nye said.And though the science debate heats up, unlike the weather, the snowstorms have set off even more questions: Why is the East Coast getting hit, while Vancouver needs to truck in snow for the Winter Olympics? Can we accurately link extreme weather with global warming?Not really, says meteorologist Jeff Masters of Weather Underground, an independent forecaster. \"You can't take regional events and link them to overall climate change,\" he said. \"There's a huge amount of natural variance.\"But some skeptics say the science isn't that innocent, even though they acknowledge global warming as a measurable anomaly. \"As climate change critics, we're not denying an increase in temperature,\" says Dan Miller, publisher of , a group that favors free-market solutions to public policy problems. \"We're skeptical of the crisis level and the cause.\"Miller says climate-change scientists have a conflict of interest, as many stand to receive \"a huge amount of money\" from the government to support continued research. \"There is no upper limit of money at stake,\" he warns.Conversely, Miller says his firm is impartial, having no financial investment in climate change; it would lose a mere 4 percent of its funding if it ends up on the wrong side of the debate. \"There's no money at stake for critics,\" he points out.Masters says in a perfect world he'd need \"200-300 years worth of records\" to accurately predict further climate change. But since that's not available, \"We're forced to make decisions on a limited data set.\" Nevertheless, Masters feels the possible dangers of global warming outweigh the risks of remaining idle. \"We need to take action even in the face of inadequate data,\" he says.Miller disagrees, arguing that we should collectively return to the drawing board -- in light of all the controversy, confusion, and potential conflicts of interest -- before we draw any conclusions.\"The science isn't settled,\" he says. \"Yes, the climate has warmed -- that's not a hoax. But can't we go back and reconsider the science?

Credit: Getty You know it's hot out there when even the soil is hyperventilating.According to a new study published yesterday (Aug. 1) in the\u00a0, there's about twice as much\u00a0\u00a0stored in Earth's soil as there is floating around the atmosphere, and for the last few decades, that underground greenhouse gas has been leaking out at a significantly increased rate.Based on more than 2,000 sources of climate data taken from ecosystems around the world, a team of soil scientists found that the rate of CO2 released from Earth's soil has increased globally by about 1.2 percent in just 25 years \u2014 and you can blame that on hot,\u00a0.\"We're talking about a huge quantity of carbon,\" study co-author Vanessa Bailey, a soil scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state, said in a\u00a0. \"Microbes exert an outsize influence on the world that is very hard to measure on such a large scale.\"Dirt doesn't actually breathe, of course, but it sort of looks that way when tiny, underground organisms help release the CO2 stored in plant roots, dead leaves and other natural detritus. Hungry microbes gorge on the tasty carbon stored in this plant matter, and then release carbon dioxide as a natural byproduct of this feeding, just as you do\u00a0after a deep breath.This process is known as \"soil respiration,\" and it's an important complement to\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 the process by which plants turn CO2, water and light into energy \u2014 helping to keep ecosystems around the world running smoothly.But lately, researchers have found that as global temperatures rise, microbes in the soil have been releasing CO2 faster than plants can snatch it up again. Previous studies have indicated that tree roots and certain microbes both\u00a0\u00a0(up until a certain point, when the intense heat causes the organisms to stop functioning completely). But the exact effects of that increase in respiration had never been studied on a global scale until now.To better understand the potential links between rising global temperatures and soil respiration, a team of researchers led by Ben Bond-Lamberty at the Joint Global Change Research Institute at the University of Maryland, College Park, examined data from two huge global nature surveys: the Global Soil Respiration Database and\u00a0, which collectively draw soil, temperature, rainfall and other data from a network of more than 2,000 sources across several ecosystems.The data showed that the rate of global soil respiration had increased by about 1.2 percent in the 25-year window between 1990 and 2014. Most of that growth was due to increased microbial action; the tiny creatures in Earth's soil are\u00a0\u00a0from our planet's surface.While a 1.2 percent increase might not seem significant on its face, the researchers made it clear that even a modest change like this represents a \"massive\" ecosystem shift over a relatively short time. And while the full effects of this microbial huffing and puffing are hard to estimate, it's possible that all that extra CO2 will feed a self-intensifying loop of atmospheric warming and soil respiration over the years to come.\"Depending on how other components of the carbon cycle might respond due to climate warming, these soil changes can potentially contribute to even higher temperatures due to a feedback loop,\" Bond-Lamberty said in the statement. \"Soils around the globe are\u00a0, which in turn can convert more carbon into carbon dioxide which enters the atmosphere.\"The study has several limitations, the authors noted. The data examined came mainly from studies of the Northern Hemisphere and included only spotty surveys of high Arctic latitudes and the tropics, so does not represent a complete picture of the planet's soil. It's also very hard to tease out cause and effect in any observational study like this one, the authors wrote, so further analysis of ecosystems around the world is required.", "headline": "Earth's soil is hyperventilating thanks to climate change", "article_name": "earths-soil-is-hyperventilating-thanks-to-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/earths-soil-is-hyperventilating-thanks-to-climate-change", "date_published": "2018-08-03 00:00:00", "article_length": 3973, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:30.734719"}

{"id": null, "body": "CNN tortures viewers with 7-hour climate change town hall.It was an act, really, of wanton cruelty committed against defenseless television viewers. On Wednesday night, CNN subjected its tiny audience to what it described as a \" Town Hall.\" The thing went on for seven hours. That's a long time.In fact, that's so long that  made at the start of the evening could have been proven wrong by the end. An entire species of polar bear might have become extinct by the third commercial break. It's a long time,And yet, in the name of science, a few hearty souls attempted to watch the entire thing. Now, we can't say with certainty what happened to them -- though, of course, they're in our prayers. But at least one of them could be seen lapsing\u00a0into total unconsciousness while was answering a question.He was the lucky one. If he was sleeping deeply enough, he might have missed CNN asking Democratic presidential hopeful Julian Castro what his administration would do to fight \"environmental racism.\" We're not making that up. But that's just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg.Though it was billed as a show about the environment, in fact, Wednesday night was really an exercise in sweaty moral posturing. At times the evening became so strident that even the candidates on stage couldn't keep up with it all., for example, tried to reassure viewers that  don't really want to take people's meat away. Apparently, he had forgotten that  had just called for that.\"I hear about it all the time. 'Booker wants to take away your hamburger,\" he said. \"Well, that is the kind of lies and fear-mongering that they spread out there,\u00a0that somehow the Democrats want to get rid of hamburgers.\"But earlier in the night, Kamala Harris said the following in this exchange.So Kamala Harris had been thinking a lot about what you eat, and she thinks you eat too much red meat, and she plans to do something about it once she is elected God. That and a number of other things.In fact, , as she indicated at the town hall.Banning drinking straws. I mean, it is mindless and annoying. If you actually cared about plastic pollution -- and you should care about plastic pollution because it's horrifying\u00a0 -- you would punish  for Chinese\u00a0plastics in the ocean. But of course, no one on the left wants to do that because they're busy sucking up to China.Though it was billed as a show about the environment, in fact, Wednesday night was really an exercise in sweaty moral posturing.But banning fracking? Now, that's just demented. Our energy sector is the single most successful part of the entire American economy. It's one of the only things propping up our trade balance right now. It's been a savior of last resort for rural areas devastated by globalization.Kamala Harris doesn't care about any of that. She probably doesn't even know. When you're a soulless demagogue bent on acquiring power at all cost, details are not relevant. All you see is yourself at the finish line, arms in the air.Ambition is a powerful drug, and yet if we're being honest about it, Harris was not even close to the least appealing candidate on the stage Wednesday night. That award goes, without question, to Father , the Patron Saint of South Bend, Indiana. Wednesday night that would have made Jonathan Edwards proud. Sinners in the hands of an angry climate God.\"You know, if you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air of creation, and people are being harmed by it, countries are at risk of vanishing in low-lying areas, what do you suppose God thinks of that?\" Buttigieg asked. \"\u00a0I bet he thinks it's messed up. At least one way of talking about this is that it's a kind of sin.\"You shudder to think of the torments waiting for you in Father Pete's Episcopalian version of hell. Imagine him lecturing you\u00a0superciliously for eternity, wagging his little fingers in your face, bragging about his virtue. It's enough to make you want to obey.Father Pete, though fears no such judgment. At the very same time\u00a0he is yelling at you about \"belching poison into the air of creation,\" Father Pete himself is likely to be sipping Perrier at 50,000 feet in the leased Gulfstream.According to an Associated Press report, Buttigieg flies on climate-destroying private jets more than any other Democratic candidate in the race right now. How can that be?We asked the Buttigieg campaign that question, and they responded, \"We fly commercial as often as possible and only fly non-commercial when the schedule dictates.\"Non-commercial -- oh that makes sense. The schedule dictates it. So when it's convenient, Father Buttigieg follows his own commandments. The rest of the time\u00a0 -- when the schedule dictates -- he is happy to belch poison into the air of creation.So you're not allowed to drink from a plastic straw -- that's immoral. But Father Pete gets to keep his private plane. So, no wonder rich people love climate activism. For them, it's all upside. It's not so great for everyone else, unfortunately.For poor people in the third world, it's going to be especially tough. We're not going to be allowed to have as many children as they would like.  explained it this way at the CNN Climate Change Town Hall.Oh, there you go. Sanders says it right out loud. The Africans are having too many babies, we're going to have to make sure those Africans have more abortions. We're going to pay for African abortions.We're also, by the way, going to have to control what people eat, how they travel and where, what they do for a living. We're going to have control every detail of their formerly personal lives. We're in charge, now, of everything.That's the message.

{"id": null, "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines for May 3 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comAs the planet warms due to  change, the Arctic winters are seeing longer open water spells and less sea ice. It also now rains more often than snow during this period, something that is directly affecting wildlife like the Svalbard reindeer.Named after the group of Norwegian islands they\u2019ve lived on for 5,000 years, these 20,000\u2013plus reindeer are now eating seaweed to survive the increasingly warm winters. According to researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Centre for Biodiversity Dynamic, the reindeer are turning to seaweed because the plants they normally eat are becoming harder to get to.More rain is now falling instead of snow, which causes the snow on the ground to freeze over (also known as \u201cicing\u201d), burying the tundra vegetation under thick ice.\n      (Credit: Tamara Hiltunen)\n      The research team first noticed that the reindeer\u2019s feeding behavior might have changed when the animals started gathering on the shoreline. They're\u00a0usually further inland, where they rake at the ice with their hooves to get to vegetation. Suspecting that the reindeer were now surviving on kelp, the team set about the undesirable task of collecting poop for analysis. They then compared the stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur values of excrement from seaweed-eating reindeer with fecal matter from the terrestrial plant-eating reindeer.Sure enough, the levels were markedly different, though it was also determined that the reindeer were eating the seaweed in addition to normal food. There are still some ice-free places for the reindeer to graze, though they\u2019re getting more and more sparse.Kelp isn\u2019t as nutritious as the tundra plants the reindeer normally eat. It also seems to be giving the reindeer diarrhea, probably from the salt content. Currently, seaweed is being more or less used as an emergency ration, with the reindeer turning to it only during spells of severe icing. According to the study, the kelp-eating has been happening for over 10 years.It\u2019s not just the seaweed diet that poses a problem. Unlike the caribou in Alaska, Svalbard reindeer don\u2019t have to live in fear of predators such as wolves or bears. Now, as they spend more time on the shoreline looking for seaweed to eat, they\u2019re left open to attacks from hungry polar bears who can\u2019t find seals to eat, thanks in large part to less sea ice.\n      (Credit: Jeffrey Welker)\n      So what can be done to help the reindeer, besides reducing climate change?

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggests Miami, Florida will 'not exist' in a few years.In the old European folktale,  went into a panic and started screaming \u201cThe sky is falling, the sky is falling\u201d to all the animals she could find, warning that the world was coming to an end. In real life today, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is panicking and telling us the oceans are rising and the end of the world is near because of climate change.Both warnings of doom and gloom are equally melodramatic and overwrought. , D-N.Y. \u2013 who pretends she\u2019s an expert on climate, energy and the superiority of her beloved socialism \u2013 has been receiving a lot of criticism for her statement last week claiming that because of climate change, Miami may not exist in a few years.Speaking at an NAACP forum to drum up support of her radical multitrillion-dollar Green New Deal that would bring economic disaster to the U.S., the freshman congresswoman said:\"What is not realistic is not responding to the crisis \u2013 not responding with a solution on the scale of the crisis. \u2026Because what's not realistic is Miami not existing in a few years. That's not realistic. So, we need to be realistic about the problem.\"That\u2019s a lot of nots. Or not.To lose Miami or not to lose Miami, that is the question.Well, my advice to the good people of Miami and their friends and relatives in other parts of the country is to take what Ocasio-Cortez says with a grain \u2013 make that a ton \u2013 of salt. She has absolutely no idea what she is talking about.Keep in mind that Ocasio-Cortez said not too long ago that the world would become unlivable\u00a0in 12 years unless we made massive changes \u2013 including some that are scientifically impossible \u2013 to all our energy choices and the way we live our lives. When her prediction of the end of the world drew ridicule, she backpedaled and said she was only being sarcastic.Sure she was.Statements like those by Ocasio-Cortez make the climate change crusade looks as hyperbolic and devoid of science as many know it is. Even people without advanced degrees in climatology or geology (like AOC herself) know her absurd statements are demonstrably untrue. A few years is a relatively short period of time, and for her statement to be even remotely true, we would need to see evidence of rising waters every single day.How will Miami, or all coastal cities, succumb to the seas? Will it be a slow encroachment \u2013 a constant rise of tides that every day inch higher and higher? Because if that\u2019s the case the locals should be able to observe tomorrow, or next week, something measurably different in their coastal surroundings than they do today. Or will Miami be flooded like it was in the movie \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow,\u201d in which a giant wave washes over the city? If this happens, where would the wave originate?\u00a0 It must be from the melting ice caps, something we hear about constantly, right?Don\u2019t bet on it.It\u2019s been 10 years since former Vice President Al Gore said : \u201c\u2026 some of the models suggest \u2026 that there is a 75 percent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during summer, during some of the summer months, could be completely ice-free within the next five to seven years.\u201dEarlier this month a group of climate change activists en route to document the vanishing ice needed to be  halfway between the North Pole and Norway. Their boat, the Malmo, got stuck in ice.There is another way to create such giant waves: King Triton can generate them. For those of you not familiar with his majesty, he is the king of the seas in the Disney cartoon \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d The cartoon came out in 1989 \u2013 the same year Ocasio-Cortez was born. Perhaps the congresswoman can subpoena King Triton to testify before Congress.According to Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 and many other Democrats, including some presidential candidates \u2013 \u00a0climate change is the most important issue facing us today and no sacrifice is too great and no program too costly to fight it. It is the equivalent of an earlier generation\u2019s fight in World War II \u2013 or maybe even bigger.I have to disagree.Last year in America  than 70,000 people died of opioid overdoses. Every night  than 500,000 homeless people sleep on our nation\u2019s streets. Each  20 of our military veterans and active-duty military service members commit suicide on average \u2013 maybe one of them while you are reading this. None of these issues is granted the same soaring rhetoric of moral consequence as climate change, let alone hours of televised presidential town halls like the recent seven-hour marathon on CNN.And while there are real human, material and moral needs in America, there is also much to celebrate, especially in an industry that is repeatedly and willfully maligned by the left-wing climate warriors: the fossil fuel industry.Last year New Mexico had a budget surplus of $1.2 billion, thanks to oil and gas revenue. When leftists clamor for funding programs to benefit children, the poor, migrants and other groups, this is where the money comes from. Employment in this field  to grow at 1.7 percent and most of these jobs do not require expensive four-year college degrees.All this while carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 the very \u201cpollutants\u201d that give climate activists nightmares \u2013  to decrease. I don\u2019t see anyone applauding this.Saying Miami will be gone in a few years is a silly comment that deserves criticism. But more so, the effort to brand climate change a moral crisis worthy of bankrupting our economy and eliminating the jobs of millions of Americans needs to stop.The fossil fuel industry is not America\u2019s enemy, and political leaders like AOC should either temper their words or reject the very oil, gas, coal, electricity, plastic, and inexpensive food and material goods that make help America the greatest place on Earth.And as for Miami, I have confidence the city will be around for a very long time to come \u2013 even long after Ocasio-Cortez has retired from public life.", "headline": "Daniel Turner: Ocasio-Cortez says climate change may drown Miami \u2013 As usual, she\u2019s laughably wrong", "article_name": "daniel-turner-ocasio-cortez-says-climate-change-may-drown-miami-as-usual-shes-wrong", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/daniel-turner-ocasio-cortez-says-climate-change-may-drown-miami-as-usual-shes-wrong", "date_published": "2019-09-15 00:00:00", "article_length": 5949, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:37.927144"}

The warmed plots run on 480 volts of electricity, and while the lines are isolated from the soil, the scientists use insulated boots to avoid getting electrocuted in case of an accident.Nearby, plant physiologist Rob Tunison clamped what looked like a small compact mirror around a dark green leaf to measure photosynthesis, spending 30 minutes to an hour per leaf.Wood said they are looking at how temperatures affect basic processes such as photosynthesis \u2014 by which plants transform sunlight into energy while absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing that gas along with oxygen into the atmosphere \u2014 as well as how soils respond.The researchers are also studying nutrients and microbes in the artificially warmed plots of land, keeping sending frozen samples to a lab in California for analysis.Knowledge about tropical plants and soils could eventually be plugged into models to determine how vastly broader ecosystems respond to changes.\"We are also able to look at the potential for tropical plants and soils to acclimate to consistently warmer conditions over time,\" Wood said.Tropical forests play a key role in recycling carbon dioxide, and they store about a third of the world's carbon, she said. They also help generate rainfall across the world by releasing water vapor, which in turn creates clouds.\"Anything that happens in these systems can have an effect on the world's climate,\" she said.U.S., British and international climate agencies reported this month that 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record, and global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide saw their largest spike in seven years. Overall, global carbon dioxide emissions have increased 55 percent in the past two decades, and Earth has warmed on average about two-thirds of a degree Celsius, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.British meteorologists said in early February that the next five years could see record-breaking temperatures. Scientists expect the world this year will spew 40.9 billion tons (37.1 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion tons (36.2 billion metric tons) last year, according to studies by the Global Carbon Project.Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology who is not involved in the experiments at El Yunque, said she was not aware of any other long-term warming experiments in tropical rainforests.\"What will happen at their site is highly uncertain, because the rainforest itself controls so many aspects of the regional water cycle. It's not a system that we can model extremely well today, let alone under climate change scenarios,\" Cobb said. \"But there is little doubt that these kinds of long-term monitoring sites are extremely valuable in advancing our understanding of the water and carbon cycle, and how they might change with climate change.\"The $3 million project, partly funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, is in its fourth year and Wood said she hopes it can run indefinitely. Scientists took a one-year hiatus after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, 2017, so they could separate the effect of warming from the effect of the storm, which caused more than $100 billion in damage and toppled trees like dominoes.A couple of miles from Woods' experiment, scientists including those from the International Institute of Tropical Forestry are looking at how hurricanes affect the tropical forest. They began by trimming away the canopy leaves above patches of forest to mimic the effects of a storm. They hired arborists to cut tree branches and spread them across the forest floor to study how light and water move through the changed ecosystem and the impact that the debris has on soil microbes. They also monitor cloud base heights to get a sense of how changes could affect rainfall.Maria suddenly gave them a real-life test.\"It poses a lot of challenges but a lot of opportunities to move the science forward,\" said Grizelle Gonzalez, a project leader.The experiments are expected to continue for several years, barring any interruptions from storms as the Caribbean prepares for another Atlantic hurricane season that starts June 1.Cobb, the global warming scientist, praised the ongoing experiments.\"It is well worth the effort,\" she said. \"The raw beauty of these environments is really only matched by their immense scientific potential.\"", "headline": "Hurricanes create natural climate change labs in Puerto Rico", "article_name": "hurricanes-create-natural-climate-change-labs-in-puerto-rico", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/hurricanes-create-natural-climate-change-labs-in-puerto-rico", "date_published": "2019-02-21 00:00:00", "article_length": 5769, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:38.557782"}

Our bipartisan carbon-dividend solution \u2013 backed by a broad coalition of supporters \u2013 is ideally suited for this moment.It will be tough enough to reverse today\u2019s economic crisis and alleviate the misery many Americans are experiencing without adding expensive or ill-conceived climate policies. An effective policy must enhance \u2013 not hamper \u2013 a domestic  currently being savaged by the pandemic. It should also promote the competitiveness of American firms, compel China and India to do their fair share, and position the United States to win the clean energy race.Our solution to this critical challenge is a revenue-neutral national carbon fee that cuts U.S. carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2035 and returns all the revenues raised directly to all Americans. Long preferred by economists and business leaders, a well-designed and gradually rising carbon fee is the most cost-effective climate solution. But rather than allow Congress to spend revenues from such a fee on projects that it chooses, the money would be returned to American families in the form of a quarterly dividend. A carbon fee that neither grows the government nor drains the economy is not a tax in the truest form.Our carbon dividend proposal would benefit those most devastated by the growing economic recession. To cushion the initial economic blow of the pandemic, Republicans and Democrats quickly agreed to send direct cash payments to low- and middle-income families. But such payments can be financed by debt for only so long.\u00a0 Our plan would keep direct payments to all American families flowing for the long term, and in a manner that is fully funded. Most families, and especially the most vulnerable, would benefit financially under this climate solution.To further stimulate the economy, our plan calls for lessening the current regulatory regime that will stunt the ability of American industry to respond to the current crisis. An escalating carbon fee that reduces emissions at the required scale and speed enables us to safely and responsibly replace regulations that would no longer be necessary.Such a COVID-era climate policy will thus provide the predictability companies need to make the kind of long-term investments that will be a critical aspect of an economic rebound.Unshackled by these regulations, American ingenuity will return our country to its prior position as the world\u2019s leading energy innovator. The United States now ranks a distant fourth behind China, Germany and Japan in the production, export and installation of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. Just as dominance in the information technology revolution underpinned America\u2019s economic dynamism and job growth over the past two decades, dominating the clean tech revolution will be similarly consequential in the future. Falling behind in the clean energy race imperils not only our economic strength but also our broader national interest.No less important, our climate policy promotes the competitiveness of U.S. firms and the re-shoring of manufacturing jobs.\u00a0 Although American industries produce less carbon per unit than many of their competitors in other countries, current U.S. policy fails to leverage this advantage.Effectively, we subsidize less carbon-efficient manufacturing in China and elsewhere, and invite \u201ccarbon dumping\u201d by nations with more lax environmental standards. In a world of lower oil prices, reversing this situation will become even more important in protecting and enhancing the competitiveness of our companies.The best way to level the playing field and monetize America\u2019s carbon advantage is to impose carbon tariffs on imports from countries without a similar climate program, all as part of a comprehensive U.S. climate strategy. Such a policy could help the United States reclaim its historic position at the head of the global table, thereby advancing our economic and geopolitical interests at the same time.Convincing other leading emitters such as China and India to effectively reduce their carbon emissions is a difficult chore. The proposed tariffs, however, would compel China and India to either follow suit or face economic penalties.In addition to hastening economic recovery, our plan provides a commonsense way forward that addresses America\u2019s toughest challenge \u2013 the political dysfunction ripping our country apart. Sadly, during this time of national calamity \u2013 when domestic cohesion is critically important \u2013 the partisan gap seems to be growing even wider.The plan we propose is not a political panacea. But it is the only approach supported by Democrats, Republicans, environmentalists and industrialists who rarely agree on anything today.

His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, has also pledged support for the\u00a0Green New Deal, which calls for a series of radical and costy transformations to the U.S. economy.As the pandemic spread in the U.S.,\u00a0 have suggested\u00a0that the upside of halting economic activity was a lower burden on the environment. In May, The Washington Post claimed \"global emissions plunged an unprecedented 17 percent during the coronavirus pandemic.\"While last week's study acknowledged emissions reductions, it also concluded: \"We estimate that the direct effect of the pandemic-driven response will be negligible, with a cooling of around 0.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.005\u2009\u00b0C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies.\" This scenario assumes partial lockdown measures continue till the end of 2021 with emissions recovering to a baseline by the end of 2022.It adds that \"with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3\u2009\u00b0C by 2050.\" But according to Myron Ebell, who leads the Center for Energy and Environment at the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), even those changes would be futile.\u201cSince the first global warming treaty was signed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent subsidizing renewable energy,\" Ebell told Fox News on Thursday. \"Yet the only thing that has bent the curve of rising global greenhouse gas emissions has been the current economic collapse. But the drop in emissions caused by the shutdown is just a first step. To achieve the emissions targets agreed to in the Paris climate treaty in 2015 would require similar hits to the global economy every year for the next thirty years.\u201dLike the Nature Climate Change study, Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates recently pointed out that despite hemorrhaging huge sums of money, the economic shutdown left the world still needing comprehensive change.\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is not how much emissions will go down because of the pandemic, but how little,\" he said. He pushed for quick action, noting that \"[i]t will take decades to develop and deploy all the clean-energy inventions we need.\"Under former President Barack Obama, the international community rallied around the Paris Climate Agreement, which aimed to reduce global temperature increases by 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The study's authors argue that goal would still be in reach if the world pursued a \"green stimulus recovery\" from the pandemic.Still, it's unclear if the world can undergo the amount of structural transformation to adequately reduce emissions. In November, the United Nations released a report claiming that the international community had already fallen behind the goals it undertook just a few years prior. It called on the world to increase its efforts even as the U.S. -- one of the world's largest emitters -- pulled out of the agreement due to economic concerns.The World Resources Institute posits that in order to reach the Paris temperature goal, the world would need to reduce global emissions to zero by 2050 -- something U.S. lawmakers have reached for with their own proposals. For example, the Green New Deal\u00a0seeks to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.Liberals have defended such sweeping proposals as economically beneficial. For example, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has estimated savings as high as $70.4 trillion over 80 years by \"averting climate catastrophe.\"But conservative studies indicate\u00a0the burden of comprehensive transformation is simply too great.The Heritage Foundation  the Energy Information Administration's National (EIA) Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching net-zero. Not only did the model crash, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the plan. The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58 percent reduction in emissions, achieved through a $300 carbon tax\u00a0 -- taxes above $300 crashed the EIA's model.Other studies from Ebell's group have attempted to measure the cost for just part of the massive climate proposal, and found swing state households could face around $75,000 within the first year or implementation. Democrats argue their plans would spur economic growth, provide jobs, and assist low-income Americans.For example, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,\u00a0released a \"Green New Deal for Public Housing.\" \"The legislation is expected to create\u00a0\u00a0per year across the country while reducing carbon emissions on the scale of taking 1.2 million cars off the road over the next ten years,\" a \u00a0claimed.It added: \"Public housing costs would also be reduced by $97 million per year, or 30 percent, and energy costs would be slashed by $613 million, or 70 percent.\"As Ebell noted, emissions have been without any major disruptions since the 90s. Back in April, Anthony Watts of the conservative Heartland Institute an analysis claiming that despite lower emissions, the world's atmospheric levels of CO2 remained the same.Both the Heartland Institue and CEI have been  to the Charles Koch\u00a0who, with his late brother David, led a company that manufactured petroleum products. Heartland  that it never received funding from Koch Industries and that Charles' charitable foundation funded a project on free-market health care solutions, but not climate change.The United Nations 2019 , which examines shortfalls in reaching its climate goals, expressed optimism in some countries\u2019 commitments to reduce emissions. It argued that countries could surpass the 1.5 degree Celsius goal if they met their current conditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC\u2019s) -- or commitments they pledged to fulfill under certain conditions surrounding capability and resources.Overall, though, the report\u00a0said that emissions continued to rise in spite of political attempts to address the issue. It argued that with current baseline or \u201cunconditional\u201d NDC\u2019s, there\u2019s a \u201c66 percent chance that warming will be limited to 3.2\u00b0C by the end of the century.\u201dSam Dorman is a reporter with Fox News.

Credit: University of Rochester illustration/Michael Osadciw Did climate change already kill all the aliens we've been searching for?According to astrophysicist Adam Frank, it's certainly a possibility \u2014 and whether humans are doomed to the same fate may already be out of our hands.Frank, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester in New York, is the lead author of a new paper published May 1 in\u00a0\u00a0that aims to take what Frank calls a \"10,000-light-year\" view of anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. Using mathematical models based on the disappearance of a real-life lost civilization here on Earth (the former inhabitants\u00a0), Frank and his colleagues simulated how various alien civilizations might rise and fall if they were to increasingly convert their planet's limited natural resources into energy. []\"The laws of physics demand that any young population, building an energy-intensive civilization like ours, is going to have feedback on its planet,\" Frank said in a\u00a0. \"Seeing\u00a0\u00a0in this cosmic context may give us better insight into what's happening to us now and how to deal with it.\"The results, as you might expect, were generally pretty grim. Of four common \"trajectories\" for energy-intense civilizations, three ended in apocalypse. The fourth scenario \u2014 a path that involved converting the whole alien society to\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 worked only when civilizations recognized the damage they were doing to the planet, and acted in the right away.\"The last scenario is the most frightening,\" Frank said. \"Even if you did the right thing, if you waited too long, you could still have your population collapse.\"For Frank, the path to modeling an apocalypse starts with\u00a0.\"Easter Island presents a particularly useful example for our own purposes since it is often taken as a lesson for global sustainability,\" Frank and his colleagues wrote in the paper. \"Many studies indicate that Easter Island's inhabitants depleted their resources, leading to starvation and termination of the island's civilization.\"Working from previous equations that modeled\u00a0\u00a0alongside the depletion of its resources, the team found four possible end points for a\u00a0\u00a0similarly constrained by limited natural resources.\"The first trajectory we found is what we call the die-off,\" Frank said.In this scenario, the civilization's population skyrockets over a short period of time, and as the aliens guzzle energy and belch out greenhouse gases, the planet's temperature spikes, too. (In this study, temperature was used to represent human-made impacts on the planet's habitability via greenhouse gas pollution.) The population peaks, then suddenly plummets as rising temperatures make survival harder and harder. The population eventually levels off, but with a fraction of the people who were around before. []\"Imagine if seven out of 10 people you knew died quickly,\" Frank said. \"It's not clear a complex technological civilization could survive that kind of change.\"The second scenario is sustainability. Here, both the planet's population and its global temperature climb rapidly but then level off when the civilization recognizes how its resource management is affecting nature. To reach an equilibrium, Frank said, the population would need to switch from resources that take a high toll on the planet (like oil) to more sustainable resources (like solar energy). Civilization is saved!Both the third and fourth scenarios are called \"collapse.\" Here, as in the \"die-off\" scenario, both the planet's population and the planet's temperature rise dramatically over a short period. But this time, when people start dying from a lack of basic resources, there are no survivors. Whether a civilization merely dies off or totally collapses depends on how sensitive the environment is and how quickly it responds to rising populations.Even if the civilization realizes it's damaging the environment and makes attempts to switch to sustainable resources \u2014 a scenario called \"collapse with resource change\" \u2014 it's too late. The civilization might see a temporary slowing in the population decline, but eventually, it drops to zero anyway. The damage is done;\u00a0.The difference between a sustainable future and a deadly collapse was largely dependent on a population's foresight \u2014 how soon they realized they were destroying their planet, and how quickly they took action. According to Frank, this difference should motivate humans to take climate change seriously.\"Across cosmic space and time, you're going to have winners \u2014 who managed to see what was going on and figure out a path through it \u2014 and losers, who just couldn't get their act together and their civilization fell by the wayside,\" Frank said.\"The question is, which category do we want to be in?\"", "headline": "Climate change killed the aliens, and it will probably kill us too, new simulation suggests", "article_name": "climate-change-killed-the-aliens-and-it-will-probably-kill-us-too-new-simulation-suggests", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-killed-the-aliens-and-it-will-probably-kill-us-too-new-simulation-suggests", "date_published": "2018-06-06 00:00:00", "article_length": 4916, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:43.307285"}

{"id": null, "body": "The U.N.-appointed Intergovernmental Panel on  published a new report Monday summarizing the latest authoritative scientific information about global warming. Here are five important takeaways.BLAMING HUMANSThe report says almost all of the warming that has occurred since pre-industrial times was caused by the release of heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Much of that is the result of humans burning fossil fuels \u2014 coal, oil, wood and natural gas.The authors say global temperatures have already risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the 19th century, reaching their highest in over 100,000 years, and only a fraction of that increase can have come from natural forces.___PARIS GOALSAlmost all countries have signed up to the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to limit global warming to an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average by the year 2100. The agreements says that ideally the increase would be no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).But the report's 200-plus authors looked at five scenarios and concluded that all will see the world cross the 1.5-degree threshold in the 2030s \u2014 sooner than in previous predictions. Three of those scenarios will also see temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius.\u00a0___DIRE CONSEQUENCESThe 3,000-plus-page report concludes that ice melt and sea level rise are already accelerating. Wild weather events \u2014 from storms to heat waves \u2014 are also expected to worsen and become more frequent.Further warming is \"locked in\" due to the greenhouse gases humans have already released into the atmosphere. That means even if emissions are drastically cut, some changes will be \"irreversible\" for centuries, the report said.___SOME HOPEWhile many of the report\u2019s predictions paint a grim picture of humans' impact on the planet and the consequences that will have going forward, the IPCC also found that so-called tipping points, like catastrophic ice sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents, are \"low likelihood,\" though they cannot be ruled out.___BIG CATCHAlthough temperatures are expected to overshoot the 1.5-degree-Celsius target in the next decade, the report suggests that warming could be brought back down to this level through what are known as \"negative emissions.\" That means sucking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than is added, effectively cooling the planet again. The panel said that could be done staring about halfway through this century but doesn\u2019t explain how, and many scientists are skeptical it\u2019s possible.", "headline": "5 things to know about the new UN report on climate change", "article_name": "un-report-climate-change-5-things-know", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-report-climate-change-5-things-know", "date_published": "2021-08-09 00:00:00", "article_length": 2591, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:45.782722"}

(Credit: Stefano Mazzola/Awakening/Getty) Venice is in a state of emergency as the Italian city deals with the aftermath of one of the worst floods in its history.Late on Tuesday (Nov. 12), high tides from the surrounding lagoon surged onto the more than 100 islands that make up Venice, flooding 85% of the city and damaging artwork and many historic sites, Mayor Luigi Brugnaro\u00a0. Photos and videos posted on social media show the intense flood turning alleyways into rushing rivers, stranding large water taxis in public plazas, and drenching some of the city's most iconic historic sites \u2014 including St. Mark's Basilica, completed in 1092.According to the local\u00a0, water levels from the flood peaked at 6.1 feet (1.87 meters) last night \u2014 the highest floodwaters in more than 50 years, and the second highest ever recorded in Venice. (The tide reached 6.3 feet, or 1.94 m, in November 1966.)Venice is susceptible to some flooding \u2014 or \"aqua alta,\" as it's regionally known \u2014 every year when high tides mix with heavy rain and strong winds. However, Brugnaro noted, yesterday's intense surge was exceptional, and almost certainly linked to the increasingly powerful storms fueled by global warming.\"These are the effects of\u00a0,\" Brugnaro tweeted. \"The costs will be high.\"Of the 10 highest tides in Venice since record-keeping began in 1923, five have occurred in the last 20 years, including the current flood and one in 2018,\u00a0. Both events were tied to strong storm surges blowing northeastward across the Adriatic Sea (Venice is located on the northern seashore), thanks in part to changing patterns in the\u00a0. These jet-stream patterns are likely to continue, leading to more frequent and intense storms, as climate change escalates, Berry wrote.That puts Venice \u2014 which is\u00a0\u00a0at a rate of a few millimeters per year \u2014 at risk of more annual damage like this. To mitigate this damage, the Italian government has been developing a series of barriers and floodgates known as the Mose Project since the 1980s. The project, which was first tested in 2013, has cost billions of euros and may finally be ready for implementation in 2021, the BBC\u00a0.Two people have been reported dead from flood-related accidents since Tuesday. A man living on Pellestrina, one of the many islands that make up the Venetian lagoon, died of electrocution while attempting to start a water pump in his home. Another man was reported dead in his home in an unrelated incident.St. Mark's Basilica, the iconic cathedral sitting in Venice's central piazza, was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years (four of those floods occurred in the past 20 years,\u00a0). According to Brugnaro, the landmark suffered \"grave damage\" to its structural columns and the crypt was completely flooded. Water damage appears rampant through the city's many shops, hotels and landmarks.More \"very high\" tides and flooding are expected throughout the week, Venice's\u00a0.", "headline": "Venice suffers worst flooding in 50 years, mayor blames climate change", "article_name": "venice-suffers-worst-flooding-in-50-years-mayor-blames-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/venice-suffers-worst-flooding-in-50-years-mayor-blames-climate-change", "date_published": "2019-11-15 00:00:00", "article_length": 3037, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:46.611454"}

That\u2019s not a message of hope and optimism that kids should be embracing.While it is great for children to learn to be responsible global citizens and take care of our planet, there\u2019s a positive and responsible way to communicate that.I recall in my own childhood celebrating Earth Day, where we raised money to help plant more trees (something that actually helps the environment, by the way) and learned about recycling, all without having the living daylights scared out of us.Adults can deliver the message of taking care of the planet and have an impact doing so with positive language and outcomes instead of nihilistic ones.While I am not a psychologist (and I don\u2019t play one on TV, either), I do believe that for kids, who are developing mentally, having this fear communicated to them during this critical time of their lives is abusive. Worse, it is done by parents, schools, the media and politicians alike. Everyone needs to immediately get a grip.I remember when adults acted like adults instead of fear-mongers. Back in the 80s, when network television ran the nuclear war movie \u201cThe Day After,\u201d there were warnings that it wasn\u2019t appropriate for children and our parents wouldn\u2019t let us watch it.Now, the adults who are supposed to be shielding kids from unlikely doomsday scenarios are forcing those beliefs upon them and using the kids as political pawns.It\u2019s not just the climate change fear. I am not the first one to note that school shooter drills are also an unnecessary form of fear theater that does far more harm than good.While any school shooting is one too many and more needs to be done to ensure school safety, planting the security threat in kids\u2019 heads with practice drills surely creates needless trauma with no evidence of better outcomes.Negativity is all around us, from mainstream media to social media. It\u2019s not healthy for us to be constantly consuming a negative information diet, particularly when the general outlook for life is so robust. We need more gratitude towards the abundance, opportunities and advancements that surround us.As an adult, if you want to mire yourself in pessimism, that\u2019s your choice.

In that same speech, he slammed \u201cdraconian climate rules\u201d and vowed to cut any funding for United Nations programs related to combatting climate change. In the past, Trump has refused to acknowledge that humans contribute to climate change and has dismissed it as a hoax.Though the Paris Climate Agreement is not legally binding, the decision to either stay or withdraw has been deeply polarizing not only with lawmakers but also members of Trump\u2019s inner circle.Trump\u2019s chief strategist Steve Bannon as well as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt had been pressing the president to exit the deal. Both sat in the front row during Thursday\u2019s announcement and applauded.Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka as well as business leaders and other U.S. allies have been pushing pro-Paris agenda for weeks.

Google is diving headfirst into the climate-change debate with a \"21 Club\" of hand-picked experts that the search engine giant hopes will drive the conversation -- and guide investments -- in climate change.But it's a discussion that even the club's members say is meant to be one-sided.\u201cIf Google included people who challenged that debate, they would be wrong to do so,\u201d said Matthew Nisbet, an associate professor for the School of Communication at American University and one of the 21 .\u201cAs to whether climate change is happening, humans  a cause and it  a problem -- there is no scientific debate over that,\" Nisbet told FoxNews.com.A review of the 21 Club confirms Nisbet's comment. The group includes meteorologists, communication specialists, and even weather forecasters, as well as few scientists who research climate change for a living. None argue that the planet isn't in imminent danger.Simon Donner, with the University of British Columbia, recently wrote that unless coral reefs learn to adapt, climate change may rapidly bring on their demise. Noah Diffenbaugh of Stanford University recently concluded that \"global warming exacerbates poverty vulnerability in many nations,\" arguing that the cost of food staples in Bangladesh, Mexico, Indonesia and other countries will jump with the temperature.\"There is consensus amongst scientists that humans are changing the Earth's climate,\" reads the mission statement on , headed up by Brian Helmuth of the 21 Club.From food to rocks to plants to sea life, the 21 Club believes climate change to be a dramatic problem -- one that requires dramatic action.Eugene Cordero with San Jose University even created the Green Ninja, a climate-action superhero who fights global warming.\u201cOur goal is to foster an open dialogue and provide the tools,\u201d argued Amy Luers, the senior environment program manager at , the non-profit funded by Google, speaking to FoxNews.com.Depending on what the scientists learn, they may develop a system that shows where climate change is occurring on the globe. Or, using technology such as Google Earth, they might map out detailed models showing the effects of climate change.In other words, some day you might be able to find out that the water near Costa Rica is 1 percentage point warmer since 1980, or that Alaska's glaciers have melted \u2026 slightly.Google's position toward climate change should not come as a surprise; the company has historically shown . As FoxNews.com reported last October, Google gives more to Democratic politicians than to Republicans, for example.So what's Google up to, anyway?Part of the motivation seems to be funding new climate change research.Jack Gold, a research analyst, told FoxNews.com that promoting new research often ends up generating new product ideas. He said having good models for climate change can also feed into the company's own data visualization efforts.The company likely sees the search term \u201cclimate change\u201d popping up in search results, too. \u201cThey are probably reacting to what people are interested in,\u201d Gold said.Jon Peddie, a consumer analyst with , told FoxNews.com that Google may have other motives in mind. \u201cThey are pursuing offshore wind farms along the East Coast of the U.S. and probably want to build a solid case for the need to get off oil,\u201d said Peddie.Whatever the reason for the project, Google has big ambitions: Google.org has already doled out about $100 million in grants, mostly to green tech start-ups and alternative energy consortiums.Climate studies also involve enormous data sets from many sources and massive computing requirements for data collection. Google has the computing muscle to help analyze that data and make sense of it.\u201cIt includes conventional weather data collected by the meteorological services of the world, at the surface of the Earth and in the atmosphere from balloon-borne instruments and satellites,\" said Richard C.

But Google is also interested in important issues that make the company look good. \u201cThis promotes Google\u2019s overall brand, to be associated with problems and perhaps solutions.\u201dAnd finally, don't forget that it may all come down to business consideration.

PepsiCo's recent acquisition of Health Warrior, a maker of plant-based nutrition bars, is a typical example where a large company has snapped up a small brand to fill a niche it didn't yet cover.Such purchases help companies bolster their green credentials at a time when they're beginning to feel the heat of climate activism. Consumer goods account for about a third of greenhouse gas emissions, meaning companies that make them play a key role in efforts to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.But manufacturers like Nestle, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble also face growing scrutiny from investors who want to know what business risks they face from climate change before deciding whether to buy their stock, Ferguson said.CDP ranked the companies surveyed according to how strongly their business is threatened by climate change, what they are doing to prepare for it and how much information they disclose to the market.\"Climate change is going to be disruptive to revenues and costs,\" Ferguson told The Associated Press. \"What I would want to know as an investor is what kind of strategy they have going forward.\"In general, CDP found that European makers of fast-moving consumer goods are ahead of U.S. rivals in preparing for climate change \u2014 a disparity also seen in other sectors, such as automotive or oil and gas. France's Danone came first in the food and drinks sector, while Kraft Heinz came last out of nine; similarly Paris-based cosmetics company L'Oreal ranked second in the household and personal care sector, against New York-based rival Estee Lauder, which came last out of seven.Possible reasons for this disparity include stricter regulation from the European Union, Ferguson said.Consumer concern over plastic waste recently spurred strict new EU rules on packaging, the report noted.\"Product labelling and carbon footprinting is on the horizon,\" the authors added.CDP, which was once described as \"the most powerful green NGO you've never heard of\" by Harvard Business Review, isn't alone in suggesting it's time for companies to publish data on climate risks.Influential business weekly The Economist recently proposed that voluntary climate-related guidelines for listed companies drawn up by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors global financial system, should be made mandatory.___Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter", "headline": "Consumer goods companies preparing for climate change impact", "article_name": "consumer-goods-companies-preparing-for-climate-change-impact", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/consumer-goods-companies-preparing-for-climate-change-impact", "date_published": "2019-02-24 00:00:00", "article_length": 3531, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:51.694052"}

The main cause of the increase is rising greenhouse gas emissions, it finds.The Sahel is an area about four times the size of Texas that stretches across Africa along the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.

We can phase out fossil-fuel emitters \u2014 such as coal-burning power plants, jet-fuel-slurping planes and gas-thirsty automobiles \u2014 once they reach their retirement age, a new study finds.And we need to start doing that now, the researchers said.If society actually did that, we'd have a 64 percent chance of limiting the average global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels, said study lead researcher Christopher Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science at the University of Leeds, in England. []\"We could ramp down all of the fossil-fuel-emitting infrastructure that we have, all of the way until it reaches the end of its life,\" Smith told Live Science. \"And then we'd replace it with something [that emits] zero carbon.\"However, this plan \u2014 while scientifically sound \u2014 is likely a pie-in-the-sky idea that won't happen anytime soon, said Donald Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who wasn't involved with the research.\"It's just not going to happen,\" Wuebbles told Live Science. \"It's so much cheaper to rehabilitate existing facilities than it is to totally close everything off.\"On the upside, weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels will likely happen at some point, just not tomorrow, Wuebbles said. Generally, it takes about 40 to 50 years for society to change its major power sources, for instance from coal to nuclear power plants. \"I think this one [from fossil fuels to renewable energy] is going to occur somewhat more rapidly, but it's still going to be hard,\" Wuebbles said.Smith's team chose the 2.7 degree F (1.5 degree C) benchmark because that's a temperature increase that could unleash extreme flooding on small island states, he said. \"The difference in the sea level rise of the rate of warming between 1.5 and 2 degrees [celsius] would literally be life or death for them,\" Smith said.And because climate change doesn't follow a linear trajectory (instead, it becomes much worse at high levels of warming), an increase of 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) could be catastrophic, Smith noted. That said, \"it is probably better to aim for [1.5 degrees C] and miss it slightly than it is for us to say \" Smith said. \"Because 1.6 [degrees C] is still a lot better than 2. I would definitely say we should have ambition and every fraction of a degree warming we can avoid is a good thing.\"So, he and his colleagues got to work to see whether humans could stick to the 2.7 degree F (1.5 degrees C) benchmark if societies the world over phased out sources of fossil fuels and then replaced them with zero-carbon alternatives. It was possible, they found; if the plan was followed, carbon-dioxide emissions would become near zero after just 40 years. []\"If we don't build any new fossil fuel infrastructure, there is a good chance we'll avoid the worst impacts of climate change,\" Smith said. There is hope on the horizon, too, he added. Even if some federal governments aren't taking action, some state governments and companies are. For instance, in December 2018, the shipping giant Maersk pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050.But humans have to act quickly, Smith noted. If governments and private industries wait until 2030 to start phasing out fossil-fuel emitters, there will only be a 50 percent chance that the world will be able to keep the average temperature increase to 2.7 degrees F, even if the rate of fossil-fuel retirement is accelerated, the researchers found.Meanwhile, the transition will likely happen, but a lot more slowly than the study plan calls for, Wuebbles said. \"The bottom line is, I agree with the concept of the paper, it's an interesting piece of work, he said. \"I just don't see the political systems responding, unfortunately.\"The study also has two major caveats. First, it does not \"assess the practical feasibility of this transition,\" but rather focuses on the numbers, the researchers wrote in the study. That's a tall order, as phasing out fossil-fuel emitters will be an expensive and time-consuming mission, especially in industries that don't have good green energy alternatives yet, such as aviation.In addition, the study doesn't consider hard-to-predict climate-change contributors, such as permafrost melt or forest dieback, which were not included in their model, Smith said. But even if these events occur, limiting human-made greenhouse gases is still worthwhile, Smith said.The study was published online today (Jan. 15) in the journal .", "headline": "Here's the 1 way we can avoid climate catastrophe, scary report says", "article_name": "heres-the-1-way-we-can-avoid-climate-catastrophe-scary-report-says", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/heres-the-1-way-we-can-avoid-climate-catastrophe-scary-report-says", "date_published": "2019-01-16 00:00:00", "article_length": 4643, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:15:58.964172"}

Less noticed but equally ominous is a campaign by environmental activists and their politician allies to use criminal and civil laws to punish fossil fuel companies for expressing doubts about the inevitability of catastrophic climate change.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D\u2013 R.I., was already calling for RICO charges when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman upped the ante in November with a subpoena demanding that Exxon Mobil produce decades of records about its approach to climate change. The damage Schneiderman and the rest of the Green Guards are doing to the First Amendment may well come back to haunt them.Ostensibly, Schneiderman is investigating whether Exxon Mobil was aware of but failed to adequately warn investors about the possible risks posed to the oil industry by climate change. The truth, however, is that Exxon has explicitly disclosed those risks in its financial filings and has published more than fifty scientific papers on the evidence for and against extreme climate change. \"[T]he accusation isn\u2019t really that Exxon misled the public,\" notes Holman Jenkins in theWall Street Journal. \"It\u2019s that Exxon refused to sign up for [the left's] vision of climate doom that would justify large and immediate costs to reduce fossil fuel use.\"While Schneiderman is entitled to champion a vision of climate doom, he is not entitled to use the laws against securities fraud to silence those with a different vision. For one thing, securities laws are aimed at the disclosure of facts that would otherwise be unknown to investors, not at societal threats that are part of the public debate. There is little doubt that nuclear war would have a catastrophic effect on corporate profits, but companies are not obligated to discuss those risks in their financial filings.Moreover, debate about matters of public concern, such as climate change, are at the core of the speech protected by the First Amendment. Last year, the U.S Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit warned against exactly what Schneiderman is attempting\u2014allowing the government to \"regulate otherwise protected speech using the guise of securities laws.\"Despite the \"corporations aren't people\" mantra, the Supreme Court has consistently said that the speech of corporations\u2014from tobacco companies to the New York Times\u2014is protected by the First Amendment whether it involves commercial information or political issues. Where, as in New York, the government tries to suppress speech because it disagrees with the content, the courts impose the strictest First Amendment scrutiny.Accordingly, any indictment of Exxon would likely be dismissed. \u00a0But winning in court is not the point of the New York investigation. Instead, it is akin to a SLAPP suit (a strategic lawsuit against public participation), which by definition, is aimed not at a legal victory but at silencing one's opponents in a public debate through intimidation and the burden of legal costs. Many states have enacted anti-SLAPP suit laws to protect free speech, which is under a heightened threat in Schneiderman's investigation because it is the government rather than a private party doing the intimidating.Sadly, Schneiderman, Whitehouse, and the others behind this campaign are unlikely to be deterred by the law or the facts. But perhaps they can be dissuaded with a reminder that their precedent could well come back to bite them and their sacred cows.Consider, for example, the green lobby's decades-long -- but now discredited -- warning that the world would soon run out of fossil fuels. If any company profiting from the resulting push for alternative energy had an inkling that the scarcity scenario would not pan out but failed to disclose the damage that would do to its bottom line, the company could face charges under Schneiderman's vision of securities law.And what about the groundless claim that building the Keystone Pipeline would increase carbon emissions? Perhaps a red state attorney general should launch an investigation into which green energy companies selfishly encouraged that lie without disclosing that science and logic argued against it.Conservative attorneys general need not limit their investigation of securities violations to misinformation about environmental issues. Consider the corporations advocating for immigration reform while arguing that it won't cost the jobs of American citizens. Let's hope those companies are explicitly warning their investors that business plans predicated on hiring immigrants will be endangered if evidence emerges that immigration reform hurts American workers.Finally, many companies are planning to hire increasing numbers of female science graduates based on the popular theory that, as discrimination abates, half of all science degrees will be earned by women. \u00a0What if corporate executives suspect there are real differences in the scientific ability or interests of men and women but hide their doubts from investors? Should these gender-difference deniers go to jail?If Schneiderman and his green comrades succeed, their model for silencing critics will surely be replicated by attorneys general and trial lawyers on the left and right. Progressives who don't want to go down that road should reconsider a tried-and-true approach too often eschewed by today's climate activists and student protestors. They should engage rather than silencing those with whom they disagree, trusting that if their progressive ideas are superior, those ideas will need no investigations, lawsuits or witch hunts to prevail.", "headline": "Climate change vs. free speech: Punishing fossil fuel companies for expressing doubt", "article_name": "climate-change-vs-free-speech-punishing-fossil-fuel-companies-for-expressing-doubt", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-vs-free-speech-punishing-fossil-fuel-companies-for-expressing-doubt", "date_published": "2015-12-08 00:00:00", "article_length": 5803, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:00.142022"}

But\u00a0alarmist headlines and personal agendas only give\u00a0climate change deniers more ammunition in the fight against real science that tells\u00a0us we need to pay attention to climate change.In response to a report from a European Satellite Agency, everyone from CNN to \u00a0is howling from the rooftops about June being \"the hottest month ever recorded on\u00a0Earth.\"The report has been interpreted to show that the global average temperature this June was about 0.18 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the previous\u00a0record set in\u00a0June 2016.According to the same headlines and tweets, experts say that climate change is to blame.Let\u2019s take a look.First, many have mistakenly called\u00a0it the hottest month ever recorded. What the report actually said is that it was the hottest June ever recorded, not the hottest month.Second, technically speaking, yes, it is the hottest June \"ever recorded.\" But recordings are only officially recognized back to the 1880s. During the Hadean period billions of years ago, Earth had a surface temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit.\u00a0We do not have enough reliable data from historical times, and we simply don\u2019t know what the temperatures were to the level of precision we have today.That still leaves us with the thought that this June was the hottest in the past 139 years. Is that true?Maybe.Whether\u00a02017 was\u00a0warmer\u00a0or cooler than 2015, or 2014 or 2013 really doesn\u2019t prove anything. The only way to see a pattern is to look at long-term temperature changes spanning hundreds of years, along with many other measurements.When average global temperatures are taken, there is always a margin of error on the measurement. It is impossible to find the one true value. There is always a plus or minus associated with the finding (and sometimes the plus or minus is greater than the alleged increase or decrease).For instance, an old NASA press release projected that 2015 would be the hottest year ever. The agency predicted it would break the record by\u00a0.02 degrees Celsius. However,\u00a0the margin of error was plus or minus 0.1 degrees Celsius, larger than the projected increase.In other words, they had no idea what was going to happen.Now, after a significant amount of searching, I couldn\u2019t find the statistical details of this on the Copernicus Climate Change Service\u2019s (European Commission) website (where the official statement of June\u2019s heat wave came from), but I can promise you, there is a plus or minus attached to the 0.18 increase.Let\u2019s give these measurements the benefit of the doubt and say that this June was .18 degrees Fahrenheit\u00a0hotter than the previous hottest June. Even if true, it is basically irrelevant to decision-making.Variation is the spice of life, and it exists abundantly in nature. Whether\u00a02017 was\u00a0warmer\u00a0or cooler than 2015, or 2014 or 2013 really doesn\u2019t prove anything.

The U.N.'s chief climate diplomat on Monday urged the coal industry to diversify toward cleaner energy sources and leave most of the world's remaining coal reserves in the ground. On the sidelines of a U.N. climate conference, Christiana Figueres told dozens of CEOs of coal companies meeting at Poland's Economy Ministry that their industry needs to change radically to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that scientists say are warming the planet.  ( AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) Coal took center stage in the global warming debate on Monday as a high-profile coal industry event kicked off on the sidelines of a U.N. climate conference in Warsaw.Environmental activists were outraged, saying coal is the problem, not the solution to climate change.Poland, which is presiding over both conferences, says the coal industry needs to be part of the climate discourse because a lot of coal-reliant countries \u2014 Poland included \u2014 will depend on the fossil fuel for a long time.Here are some quick facts about coal and the carbon pollution the world is releasing by burning it:WHAT IS COAL?Coal is a fossil fuel that formed over time from the remains of plants that died millions of years ago. It contains energy that those plants once absorbed from the sun.WHY DO SOME PEOPLE CALL IT A \"DIRTY\" FUEL?Apart from being a major contributor to emissions of CO2, the most important greenhouse gas, coal is a leading cause of smog, acid rain and air pollution. Governments have been trying to manage the environmental impact of coal burning ever since smoke pollution became a major problem in English cities in the 19th century.HOW MUCH CO2 EMISSIONS COME FROM COAL?Of all energy sources, coal is the dirtiest in terms of carbon pollution. In 2011, about 44 percent of total energy emissions came from coal, compared to 35 percent from oil and just over 20 percent from natural gas, according to the International Energy Agency.HOW CAN YOU REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM COAL?U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres offered one alternative Monday: leave the coal in the ground. But the reality is a lot of countries with coal resources are not ready to give it up as an energy source. Instead, they are looking for ways to reduce emissions by improving the efficiency of coal-fired plants or adopting technologies that trap the CO2 for storage underground. These technologies are expensive and have so far not been put to widespread use.IF COAL IS SO DIRTY WHY ARE WE STILL BURNING IT?Since the industrial revolution coal has been a double-edged sword for humanity, powering economic growth while polluting the environment. Even now that the climate impact is known, coal-reliant countries are reluctant to give it up, fearing it would hurt their economies. Even though China \u2014 the world's biggest carbon polluter \u2014 is investing in renewable energy, its coal use is also rising because of the huge demand for energy as its economy expands, lifting millions of people out of poverty.WHO BURNS THE MOST COAL?China is the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal. Coal accounted for 68 percent Chinese energy consumption in 2012, according to the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research, Oslo. The U.S. also is a top coal producer, but domestic coal use is declining as some power plants have switched to lower-priced natural gas.", "headline": "A glance at coal and its role in climate change", "article_name": "a-glance-at-coal-and-its-role-in-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/a-glance-at-coal-and-its-role-in-climate-change", "date_published": "2015-12-12 00:00:00", "article_length": 3532, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:04.077014"}

{"id": null, "body": "Top European leaders pledged Thursday to keep fighting against global warming as President Donald Trump announced he was pulling out of the Paris climate accord, but they rejected his suggestion that the deal could later be renegotiated.The leaders of France, Germany and Italy said in a joint statement that they regretted the United States' decision to withdraw from the accord, but affirmed \"our strongest commitment\" to implement its measures and encouraged \"all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change.\"While Trump said the United States would be willing to rejoin the accord if it could obtain more favorable terms, the three European leaders said the agreement cannot be renegotiated, \"since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economics.\"President Emmanuel Macron of France repeated that belief in an English-language speech from the presidential palace, unprecedented from a French president in an address at home. He said, \"I do respect this decision but I do think it is an actual mistake both for the U.S. and for our planet.\"\"Wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: make our planet great again,\" Macron added.The European Union's top climate change official, Miguel Arias Canente, said in a statement that Trump's decision to leave the Paris accord made it \"a sad day for the global community,\" adding that the bloc \"deeply regrets the unilateral decision.\"Canete also predicted that the EU would seek new alliances from the world's largest economies to the most vulnerable island states, as well as U.S. businesses and individuals supportive of the accord.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement \"a major disappointment\" and said it was \"crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues,\" according to his spokesman.Fiji's Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama, who in November will chair an annual climate summit in Germany, said he was deeply disappointed by Trump's decision and did what he could to try to persuade Trump to stick with the agreement as nations tackle \"the greatest challenge our planet has ever faced.\" He said he was convinced the U.S. will eventually rejoin.Bainimarama said the decision is a grave disappointment for places like his Pacific island nation and U.S. coastal cities like New York and Miami that are vulnerable to climate change. He promised to do all he can to continue to forge a grand coalition to accelerate the momentum that has built since the Paris agreement.Norway's largest pension fund with 53 billion euro ($59.5 billion) in assets under its management said it would continue to invest in renewable energy despite the American president's decision, saying in a statement that \"Donald Trump is jumping off a train that has already left the station.\"Chief executive Odd Arild Grefstad cited the growth of renewable energy in U.S. states such as Texas, New York and California as signs that \"the world has started the transition from fossil to a renewable economy.\"Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea also regretted the U.S. move and reiterated their commitment to implement the agreement. In Tokyo, an irate Koichi Yamamoto, the environment minister, said \"I'm not just disappointed, but also feel anger.\"Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso drew parallels to the U.S. setting up a plan to establish the League of Nations after World War I, only to back out later.\"Who created the League of the Nations? It was the United States who set up the League of the Nations. Then, once it started, who didn't join in? The United States. I think that's just how they are,\" he told reporters.In Mexico, former President Vicente Fox criticized Trump's move, saying on Twitter: \"He's declaring war on the planet itself.\"Fox, who has clashed with Trump since last year's presidential campaign, said the U.S. leader's decision \"condemns this generation and those to come\" and would leave \"a dark legacy just to satisfy your greediness.\"The U.S. Conference of Mayors said it strongly opposed Trump's action and vowed to continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming.New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, the group's vice president, said withdrawal from the agreement was \"shortsighted\" and called climate change a grave threat to coastal communities such as his, as well as the nation and the world.Inventor and entrepreneur Elon Musk said he would keep his promise to end his participation in two presidential councils after Trump issued his decision.\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" the CEO of electric car maker Tesla Inc. tweeted shortly after Trump officially withdrew the U.S. from the global climate pact.Meanwhile, General Motors, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, said it would continue its commitment to \"creating a better environment.\" The automaker highlighted its development of the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle with 238 miles of range on a single charge and a net price of less than $30,000.Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Co., also weighed in, saying: \"We believe climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities.\"Before Trump announced his decision Thursday afternoon, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters during a visit to Berlin that fighting global warming was a \"global consensus\" and an \"international responsibility.\"Without mentioning the U.S. specifically, Li said that \"China in recent years has stayed true to its commitment\" and pointed out that his was one of the first countries to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement.While traveling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and Pope Francis. Withdrawing would leave the United States as one of just three countries outside the agreement. The other two are Syria and Nicaragua.Russia joined the chorus speaking out for the climate accord. Speaking to reporters on Thursday before Trump's decision was announced, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said Russia \"thinks highly\" of the accords and sees no alternative to it. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that its implementation will not be as effective \"without the key signatories.\"Scientists say Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could release up to 3 billion additional tons of carbon dioxide a year \u2014 enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather.___Associated Press writers David Rising and Frank Jordans in Berlin, Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow, Gregory Katz in London, Lorne Cooke in Brussels, Gerry Shih in Beijing, Peter Orsi in Mexico City, Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Colleen Barry in Milan, Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit, Matthew Daly in Washington and Edith M.

We must halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and change the way we farm.\"He appealed for leadership \u2014 \"from politicians and leaders, from business and scientists, and from the public everywhere\" \u2014 to break what he called the current \"paralysis\" and act now.\"If we do not change course by 2020, we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change, with disastrous consequences for people and all the natural systems that sustain us,\" Guterres warned.The alternative to moving to green energy, he said, \"is a dark and dangerous future.\"Guterres said that when he addresses world leaders at their annual General Assembly gathering in two weeks, he will tell them \"that climate change is the great challenge of our time\" and what is missing is leadership and a sense of urgency to respond.He said an international meeting in Bangkok that ended Sunday made some progress on negotiations to help reach an agreement in December in Poland on guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris accord \u2014 \"but far from enough.\"\"Nothing less than our future and the fate of humankind depends on how we rise to the climate challenge,\" Guterres said. \"Keeping our planet's warming to well below 2 degrees (Celsius) is essential for global prosperity, people's well-being and the security of nations.\"He said that is why he will convoke a climate summit for world leaders in September 2019 \"to bring climate action to the top of the international agenda.\"Guterres said technology is on the side of those seeking to tackle climate change.He cited the rising use of renewable energy, saying \"today, it is competitive with \u2014 and even cheaper \u2014 than coal and oil, especially if one factors in the cost of pollution.\" And he singled out innovative programs in China, Sweden, Morocco, Scotland and Thailand.Guterres also pointed to other signs of hope including oil-rich Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy and oil-rich Norway's sovereign wealth fund \u2014 the largest in the world \u2014 moving away from investments in coal as well as in palm and pulp paper companies because of the forests they destroy.", "headline": "UN chief: World must prevent runaway climate change by 2020", "article_name": "un-chief-world-must-prevent-runaway-climate-change-by-2020", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-chief-world-must-prevent-runaway-climate-change-by-2020", "date_published": "2018-09-10 00:00:00", "article_length": 4103, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:11.976747"}

Here's a timeline of key moments in the diplomatic effort to stop global warming, leading up to the U.N. climate conference in Paris:1987: MONTREAL \u2014 Governments adopt a treaty pledging to restrict emissions of chemicals damaging the ozone layer. While it doesn't deal with climate change specifically, the Montreal Protocol becomes a model for how to rein in man-made emissions through international agreements.1988: NEW YORK \u2014 The U.N. General Assembly endorses the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is set up the same year by two U.N. agencies, the World Meteorological Organization and the U.N. Environmental Program, to assess the existing knowledge about climate change.1990: LONDON \u2014 The IPCC releases its first scientific assessment of climate change. It says greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere are increasing due to human activity, resulting in warming of the Earth's surface.1992: RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 World leaders gathering for the first Earth Summit sign the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the first international treaty aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, it sets no binding emissions targets.1997: KYOTO, Japan \u2014 The Kyoto Protocol is adopted, setting binding emissions targets for wealthy countries. The United States doesn't join the treaty because it doesn't include big developing countries such as China and India. The U.S. also says the treaty would harm its economy.2004: MOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir Putin signs a bill confirming Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. The move means countries representing more than 55 percent of global emissions support the treaty, a condition for it to take effect.2007: OSLO, Norway \u2014 Former U.S. vice president and climate campaigner Al Gore and the IPCC share the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to raise awareness about global warming.2009: COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 The first attempt to craft a global emissions treaty to replace Kyoto, which is set to expire in 2012, falls apart amid disputes between rich and poor countries over who should do what. Acrimonious negotiations end with a voluntary deal inviting countries to present nonbinding emissions targets for 2020.2011: DURBAN, South Africa \u2014 U.N. climate talks produce a major breakthrough as countries agree to adopt a universal agreement on climate change in 2015 that would take effect five years later and apply to all of them.2013: STOCKHOLM \u2014 The IPCC says it's \"extremely likely\" that human influence is the dominant reason for warming temperatures recorded since the mid-20th century.2015: PARIS \u2014 More than 190 governments meet in the French capital to finish what's envisioned as a landmark deal to rein in greenhouse gas emissions after 2020.", "headline": "Timeline of key events in international effort to combat climate change", "article_name": "timeline-of-key-events-in-international-effort-to-combat-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/timeline-of-key-events-in-international-effort-to-combat-climate-change", "date_published": "2015-11-30 00:00:00", "article_length": 2920, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:16.316013"}

Ehrlich, in 1969,\u00a0warned that \"everybody\" would \"disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years,\" The New York Times reported.According to The Salt Lake Tribune, Ehrlich, warning of a \"disastrous\" famine,\" urged placing \"sterilizing agents into staple foods and drinking water.\"Those predictions were made around the time former President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. Since then, the U.S. has adopted a series of environmental reforms aimed\u00a0at limiting emissions.Years after those initial predictions, media outlets and politicians continue to teem with claims of apocalyptic scenarios resulting from climate change.Earlier this month, leading Democratic presidential candidates held a town hall on the issue and warned about the \"existential\" threat posed by a changing climate.

Shultz refers to as a \u201cworld awash in change.\u201dOnce again nations face a challenge \u2013 climate change -- which, if left unmanaged, has the potential to bring tremendous pain to tens of millions of people, and disrupt seriously the existing economic, political, and security orders of the day.While we do not know exactly how climate change will evolve, we do know that ignoring climate change is the same as assuming that there will be no change.\u00a0 And that is exceeding unlikely.\u00a0 And like the leaders on whose watch World War One started, today\u2019s climate change policies of denial and delay are \u2018supremely dangerous\u2019.So what to do?We need to have adequate warning of truly extreme conditions or abrupt, unexpected changes in the world\u2019s climate.Public and private-sector decision-makers require more understandable, more relevant, and more  information so they can better balance the risks, needs, and costs of adaptation with their many other competing political and economic concerns and responsibilities.This goal cannot be achieved without significantly improving our ability to monitor the earth\u2019s systems so we can better understand when, why, and how the details of our climate are changing.It\u2019s all about the water.\u00a0 We must sharpen our focus on, and devote greater resources to, the management and efficient use of freshwater, both within national borders and in a cross-border context.Changes and variations in rainfall frequency, intensity and distribution, with some places drying out and other regions getting wetter, will affect virtually every aspect of our lives.Closely related to the changes in water supply will be changes and challenges in how we grow our future food. \u00a0And we must begin to seriously address another water challenge -- the inexorable rise in sea level, which threatens our coastal communities, vital economic and security infrastructure, and the lives of tens of millions of Americans and billions of people worldwide.Finally, we must attack and solve the root cause of the challenge:\u00a0 unchecked carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses entering the atmosphere.We must incentivize and transform research and development into reliable and economically viable low to no carbon baseline power generation and transportation fuels; a revenue-neutral carbon tax is a great place to start.We must think about how we make these new and existing technologies available to, and affordable for, the entire world.We must size the opportunity to focus our best minds on this challenge, then develop the needed technologies and drive their costs down so that we can be the world leader in supplying these capabilities to the world. \u00a0Ubiquitous non-carbon based power and clean water can change the world in a huge way \u2013 for the better \u2013 and the U.S. can lead the way.So here we are in 2014, facing uncertainties and choices of enormous consequence, just as the European powers faced their choices in 1914.The data and projections are laid out in front of us, as they were for them.\u00a0 Will future historians, looking back at the choices we make now, come to a similar conclusion as the 9/11 Commission:\u00a0 \u201cthe most important failure was one of imagination\u201d?Perhaps not \u2013 We see signs of hope and progress.The U.S. Department of Defense in its recently released Quadrennial Defense Reviewtreats climate change in a strategically coherent manner \u2013 linking its impacts with other global trends such as population change, growing affluence and globalization.The three proposals listed above are all feasible and affordable.\u00a0 Our nation, when focused, can perform amazing, nearly miraculous feats.\u00a0 But it requires leadership.\u00a0 We sincerely hope our political leadership remembers those ghosts from history nearly a century ago -- and this time averts the crisis.", "headline": "Time for real leadership on climate change, energy, national security", "article_name": "time-for-real-leadership-on-climate-change-energy-national-security", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/time-for-real-leadership-on-climate-change-energy-national-security", "date_published": "2015-05-07 00:00:00", "article_length": 5094, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:18.527957"}

It's no surprise to those who follow climate science that temperature patterns have shifted as the world has warmed up. But in a new study, outspoken climate scientist James Hansen goes a step further, saying devastating heat waves in recent years are the result of global warming.Since natural dynamics \u2014 such as  in the equatorial Pacific Ocean \u2014 contribute to extreme events like heat waves, this connection can be controversial.Scientists disagree on the degree to which global warming can be blamed for extreme events, such as heat waves, and Hansen, of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and , is among those most aggressive about making this connection.In the last three decades, both average and extreme temperatures have warmed up and heat waves hit much large areas, Hansen and colleagues write in a study published online Monday in the journal [pullquote]\"It follows that we can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small,\" they write. []Martin Hoerling, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Systems Research Laboratory, called this interpretation \"flawed scientifically.\"\"The weather patterns responsible for most of today's heat waves would have happened regardless of human-induced climate change,\" Hoerling told LiveScience. Bringing carbon dioxide down to the level Hansen sees as safe \"would not eradicate heat waves.\"Hansen's team acknowledges that dynamics other than global warming are at play when a heat wave hits, saying that the abnormally warm temperatures of late are the result of a combination of specific weather patterns and global warming.This description is closer to the truth, Hoerling said. \"In some cases that combination is 95 percent natural and 5 percent climate change, sometimes the mix is a little bit different.\"Historically, climate scientists have shied from making a connection between an extreme event and global warming, but more and more so-called attributional studies examine these events for human fingerprints.For example, a 2004 study concluded that human alterations to climate more than doubled the odds of heat waves on  that devastated western Europe.The record-setting 2010 Russian heat wave to which Hansen refers appears to have generated some conflicting analyses. A study in which Hoerling participated concluded this heat wave was due mainly to natural atmospheric variability. Meanwhile, a more recent study led by Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., linked record high sea-surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean and tropical Atlantic Ocean \u2014 which were, in turn, influenced by global warming \u2014 with the heat wave.With regard to the Russian heat wave, Trenberth told LiveScience he sees his study and Hansen's as taking complementary approaches.Both he and Hansen are at the aggressive end of the spectrum when it comes to attributing weather events to climate change, Trenberth said. \"James Hansen and I are pushing to get scientists to think about and do statistics on this rather differently, and now we are not part of mainstream in this regard.\"Trenberth questions why an attribution study is necessary for every single event: \"Human influence , it is pushing things in a direction where we have greater extremes,\" he said.\"Could these things have actually happened without global warming? In most cases, they probably wouldn't. There are very small odds they could have occurred,\" Trenberth said.Hansen could not be reached by deadline.", "headline": "Is climate change to blame for recent heat waves?", "article_name": "is-climate-change-to-blame-for-recent-heat-waves", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/is-climate-change-to-blame-for-recent-heat-waves", "date_published": "2015-01-13 00:00:00", "article_length": 3811, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:20.437821"}

Instead, he said there would be statements from ministers and Finland which currently holds the chair of the Arctic Council.Official U.S. statements and documents prepared for the meeting did not refer to \"climate change\" and their scientific focus was limited to reductions in U.S. carbon emissions that predate the administration and research.In a roughly 20-minute speech outlining the Trump administration's Arctic policy on Monday, Pompeo acknowledged melting ice but didn't use the phrase \"climate change.\" In fact, his address was largely an admonition against increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic. Nor did he indicate that the administration places any priority on easing the melting that scientists say is already causing oceans to rise.\"Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new naval passageways and new opportunities for trade, potentially slashing the time it takes for ships to travel between Asia and the West by 20 days,\" he said in the speech, which was met with polite but muted applause.\"Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st century's Suez and Panama Canals.\"Asked directly about climate change and the Arctic in an interview with a Finnish newspaper, Pompeo declined the opportunity to mention the phrase and downplayed the importance of the Paris climate accord from which President Donald Trump.\"My view on this and President Trump's view on this is what we should put all our emphasis on I outcomes,\" he said. \"We can call it whatever we like, but I shared some of the data in the speech. The United States is kicking it when it comes to getting its CO2 down. I mean, compare it to China, compare it to Russia, compare it, frankly, to many European nations, each of whom signed the Paris agreement.\"According to the statistics he presented, U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions fell by 14% between 2005 and 2017, while global energy-related CO2 emissions increased more than 20%. In terms of black carbon, which is a particular threat to the Arctic, U.S. emissions were 16% below 2013 levels in 2016 and are projected to nearly halve by 2025, he said.\"I'm sure it was a good party,\" Pompeo said of the negotiations in Paris. \"I'm sure it felt good to sign the agreement. But at the end of the day, what matters to human health, what matters to the citizens of the world, is that we actually have an impact on improving health. And our technology, our innovation, the R&D we put in in the United States, that's what will drive better climatic outcomes, that's what will create cleaner air and safer drinking water, and that's what I hope the whole world will focus on.\"Pompeo again declined the opportunity to mention \"climate change\" on Tuesday when he met with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland who pointedly referred to the phenomenon as she played down a dispute with the United States over the sovereignty of the Northwest Passage.\"We have a very close, very fruitful collaboration,\" she said. \"And actually, as we see the conditions of the Northwest Passage changing with our changing climate, I think that's actually grounds for closer collaboration with the United States.\"Pompeo replied by saying the U.S. is more concerned about Russia and China in the Arctic than ownership of the Northwest Passage.\"The challenges in the Arctic aren't between the United States and Canada, let me assure you,\" he said. \"There are others that threaten to use it in ways that are not consistent with the rule of law.\"", "headline": "Climate change missing as US defends Arctic policy", "article_name": "climate-change-missing-as-us-defends-arctic-policy", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/climate-change-missing-as-us-defends-arctic-policy", "date_published": "2019-05-07 00:00:00", "article_length": 4087, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:23.807930"}

A scientific branch of the Vatican is touting a climate-change report that fears for the fate of the world's glaciers, appearing to support an erroneous conclusion from the ' climate panel that skeptics have loudly debunked.But the Vatican's authors are some of the same people responsible for the U.N. error, even including Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the U.N.'s climate group and the man behind the 2007 report that feared \"the likelihood of [the Himalayan glaciers] disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner.\"The facts behind that assertion quickly melted away, with  that \"poorly substantiated estimates\" had made it into print. But like his 2007 U.N. study, , titled \"Fate of Mountain Glaciers in the Anthropocene,\" again frets over the fate of the glaciers -- and it cites his U.N. report as evidence.The new report, commissioned by the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences, notes that \"thousands of small glaciers in the Hindukush-Himalayan-Tibetan region continue to disintegrate,\" and states that \"robust scenario calculations clearly indicate that many mountain ranges worldwide could lose major parts of their glaciers within the coming decades.\"Noted climate skeptic Don Easterbrook, an emeritus professor of geology at Western Washington University, is one vocal critic of these and other conclusions on the fate of the world's glaciers.\"The [U.N.]-predicted warming of 1 degree between 2000 and the present has not happened -- instead it's gotten cooler!\" he told FoxNews.com. \"As a result, some glaciers in the Himalayas have begun advancing, and glaciers in Alaska, , and South America have also begun to re-advance.\"\"Pachauri is very intolerant of any point on climate change that isn't his,\" Patrick J. Michaels, a contributing author on the U.N. report and a senior fellow with the conservative CATO Institute, told FoxNews.com. \"He makes statements that are just wrong, because he's not a climate scientist,\" he said.Pachauri did not respond to FoxNews.com requests for more information, sent through his U.N. climate group. Neither did the climate group itself nor the Vatican's  return FoxNews.com requests. But a Vatican spokesman, Rev. Federico Lombardi, did tell the Associated Press that the document was \"important,\" although it was not a piece of the church's key teachings.Other climate scientists agreed with the new report. Graham Cogley, geography professor with Trent University, agreed that the 2007 prediction that Himalayan glaciers might disappear by 2035 was flat wrong -- but not the current claims.\"It is a dire prediction to say that mountain glaciers are 'lethally vulnerable' to climatic change, but it is literally and unquestionably correct,\" he told FoxNews.com. Michaels was more skeptical.\"Why resources collected from parishioners were used for this is beyond me,\" Michaels told FoxNews.com. \"There has been an increasing tendency over the years for churches to insert themselves into the global warming thing,\" he added.Well-known climate scientist Michael Mann thought the report may indicate shifting beliefs within the church.I actually attended a meeting of the Pontifical Academy (World Federation of Scientists) in Erice, Sicily, back in late August 2003,\" Mann told FoxNews.com. \"At the time, the president of the organization, , was a climate-change skeptic.\"\"Zichichi has the ear of the Vatican on all matters of science and science policy. So I interpret this as, perhaps, a change of heart on his part,\" Mann told FoxNews.com. \"In any case, this is indeed a significant (and in my view auspicious) development.\"The Pontifical Academy of Sciences, a Vatican advisory panel, was founded under a different name in Rome in 1603, and claims to be the first exclusively scientific academy in the world.

{"id": null, "body": "\n        FILE -- May 27, 2015: President Obama walks up the stairs of Air Force One. AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: Climate change is real, man-made and dangerous. President Obama tweeted that, and it has been repeated by countless others. It is tempting for a politician to claim that 97 percent of experts agree with you. But do they?The 97 percent claim was taken from a study paper by Australian John Cook, Climate Communications Fellow for the Global change Institute at the University of Queensland, and his colleagues, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters in May, 2013.  and it counts the number of publications, rather than the number of scientists, in support of human-made climate change. Never let facts get in the way of a good story.The paper is a treasure trove of how-not-to lessons for a graduate class on survey design and analysis: the sample was not representative, statistical tests were ignored, and the results were misinterpreted.What was an incompetent piece of research has become a highly influential study, its many errors covered up.Some of the mistakes in the study should be obvious to all. There are hundreds of papers on the causes of climate change, and thousands of papers on the impacts of climate change and climate policy. Cook focused on the latter. A paper on the impact of a carbon tax on emissions was taken as evidence that the world is warming. A paper on the impact of climate change on the Red Panda was taken as evidence that humans caused this warming. And even a paper on the television coverage of climate change was seen by Cook as proof that carbon dioxide is to blame.Cook and Co. analysed somewhere between 11,944 and 12,876 papers \u2013 they can\u2019t get their story straight on the sample size \u2013 but only 64 of these explicitly state that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming. A reexamination of their data brought that number down to 41. That is half a per cent or less of the total, rather than 97 percent.The remainder of Cook\u2019s \u201cevidence\u201d is papers that said that humans caused some climate change and, more importantly, papers that Cook\u2019s colleagues thought said as much.There is vigorous debate about how much humans have contributed to climate change, but no one argues the effect is zero. By emitting greenhouse gases, changing the landscape, rerouting rivers, and huddling together in cities, we change the climate \u2013 perhaps by a little, perhaps by a lot \u2013 but not one expert doubts we do. However, a true consensus \u2013 100 per cent agreement \u2013 does not serve to demonize those experts who raise credible concerns with the state of climate research.The trouble does not end there. Cook has been reluctant to share his data for others to scrutinize. He has claimed that some data are protected by confidentiality agreements, even when they are not. He was claimed that some data were not collected, even when they were. The paper claims that each abstract was read by two independent readers, but they freely compared notes. Cook and Co. collected data, inspected the results, collected more data, inspected the results again, changed their data classification, collected yet more data, inspected the results once more, and changed their data classification again, before they found their magic 97 percent. People who express concern about the method have been smeared.We would hope that the president of the United States of America does not spend time checking such trivia. That is the job of the editor of the journal, Dan Kammen of the University of California at Berkeleywho unfortunately has chosen to ignore all issues I and others raised about them. Similarly, the journal\u2019s publisher, the Institute of Physics, and Cook\u2019s employer, the University of Queensland, have turned a deaf ear to my concerns. What was an incompetent piece of research has become a highly influential study, its many errors covered up.And for what? If Cook\u2019s results are to be believed, 97 percent of experts agree that climate change is real and largely human-made. This does not tell us anything about the risks of climate change, let alone how these compare to the risks of climate policy.That is a difficult trade-off, and it should be informed by the best possible science rather than dodgy work like Cook\u2019s.", "headline": "Climate change: Mr. Obama, 97 percent of experts is a bogus number", "article_name": "climate-change-mr-obama-97-percent-of-experts-is-a-bogus-number", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-mr-obama-97-percent-of-experts-is-a-bogus-number", "date_published": "2015-05-28 00:00:00", "article_length": 4331, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:25.835850"}

{"id": null, "body": "'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host examines where Google is getting their information on COVIDA few days ago, the Wall Street Journal held an event called the \"Tech Health Conference.\" During the event, one reporter had a question for the head of  \"Health Division,\" a man called David Feinberg. \u00a0Why, the reporter asked, was Google censoring searches for information about the possibility that  had escaped from a laboratory in China? Feinberg began by admitting the premise of the question. Yes, Google was in fact hiding information from its users, he effectively conceded. But it was for their own good. According to Feinberg, Google didn't want to, \"lead people down pathways that we would find to be not authoritative information.\"\u00a0 Authoritative information. You\u2019ve heard that phrase a lot in the last year, and phrases like it. \"Authoritative information\" is the opposite of \"misinformation\" \u2014 or worse, a \"conspiracy theory.\" \u00a0It\u2019s really important. All you\u2019re allowed to see is authoritative information. So it\u2019s worth knowing in this and many other cases, what is it? And where exactly did Google get its so-called \"authoritative information.\" In this case, it came from a group led by a noted man of science called Peter Daszak. If the name sounds familiar, Peter Daszak is the person who almost single-handedly stopped virtually all public speculation about the lab leak early in the pandemic. Daszak did this in one swoop by organizing a letter to The Lancet -- one of the top scientific publications -- stating as fact that there was no possibility the coronavirus could have come from the lab in . No chance. Many people believed him and they stopped looking. It was in The Lancet, after all. Almost no one asked why Peter Daszak might be saying this. \u00a0We now know the answer: Peter Daszak himself was funding research on bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, using U.S. taxpayer dollars, supplied by . According to one grant Fauci approved, Daszak was authorized to conduct quote, \"virus infection experiments across a range of cell cultures from different species and humanized mice.\" \u00a0Why humanized mice? Well, because they mimic humans. Daszak and his collaborators wanted to make viruses more infectious to people. He didn't hide this. In December 2019, Daszak appeared on a podcast on YouTube -- which is owned by Google -- to brag about how easy it is to manipulate bat coronaviruses.\u00a0So really, in one of the great head-hitting in recent history, we learn that the guy directly tied to bat virus experiments in the lab in Wuhan was the same guy telling the entire world that there was no possibility this virus could have come from the Wuhan lab. Conflict of interest, anyone? It\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s beyond belief. What\u2019s amazing is Google knew it. The evidence was right there on one of its platforms \u2014 YouTube, which it owns. \u00a0So why did Google continue to rely on Peter Daszak, of all people on earth, to decide what the world could know about the origins of COVID? That\u2019s the question. Tonight, we know why. It turns out  wasn't the only one funding Peter Daszak's research on bat viruses. Google was funding that research, too.\u00a0It sounds unlikely, but we know it.\u00a0We know this from a new piece in the National Pulse, which just published the evidence. Here\u2019s the evidence: Peter Daszak admitted it in print. We don\u2019t need to speculate, it\u2019s right there. Beginning in 2010, several of Daszak's research papers explicitly acknowledge that they were funded by Google. One of those papers was an observational study that analyzed the transmission of viruses from bats to humans in Bangladesh. \u00a0\"Proximity of bats to human populations may facilitate the transmission of viruses either through direct contact or through food-borne routes.\"\u00a0A decade later, Google paid for Peter Daszak to take his studies of bat viruses to Guangdong Province, China, home of the now-famous bat caves. While there, Daszak used Google's money to study the quote, \"perceptions associated with transmission of pathogens with pandemic potential in highly exposed human populations at the animal-human interface.\" \u00a0So, yes, Peter Daszak knows an awful lot about bat-borne pandemics. It seems likely he is implicated in one. Google is likely implicated in it as well. Together, Google and Daszak worked to keep critical factual information from the public, as nearly four million people around the world died from the virus. It\u2019s a horrible story, and someday, perhaps soon, we\u2019ll learn all of it.But in the meantime, as we await the indictments we fervently hope are coming, the whole ugly story makes you wonder bigger things. For example, how many other dangerous, potentially world-altering experiments are going on right now, in this and other counties, funded by the secretive daisy-chain of government health agencies, and powerful NGOs? Experiments you\u2019ve never heard of but that could change your life forever? If they can engineer bat viruses to make them more infectious, and oops, they escaped from a lab, what else are they doing? You\u2019re not supposed to ask of course. You\u2019ve been commanded to \"trust the science,\" and get back to watching Netflix. Only a Neanderthal asks questions. That\u2019s been the arrangement in science for quite a while now. You pay for it, we do it, it\u2019s all good. But why should that continue? Now that we know liars and moral pygmies \u2014 people like Tony Fauci, and the soulless bots at Google HQ \u2014 and running global science, maybe it\u2019s worth being slightly more inquisitive about what\u2019s happening in labs around the world. Why not? It could affect us. \u00a0For example, take a look at this tape. It\u2019s from an annual conference called the \"World Science Festival.\" A few years ago, the conference featured a professor of bioethics and philosophy at New York University named Mathew Liao. \u00a0Liao is among the most influential bioethicists in the world \u2014 a fact that will amaze you. Liao explained that  can be solved with something called \"human engineering.\"\u00a0Here\u2019s a tip: anyone who uses the phrase \"robust ethical framework\" wouldn\u2019t know ethics if they got in the shower with them. And you know that for a fact because he uses the phrase \"human engineering.\"Human engineering? The name alone should make you pause. People aren\u2019t bridge improvements. You can\u2019t just add rebar, pour a few yards of concrete, and improve the human condition, much less the human soul. People are living beings. They\u2019re alive. They can\u2019t be engineered. Liao the eminent bioethicist seems unaware of this. He outlined some of his proposals in a recent paper in the Journal of \"Ethics, Policy & Environment.\" In that paper, Liao suggests a solution to the problem, the pressing problem, of people eating hamburgers. People like hamburgers, it turns out. How can we get people to stop eating hamburgers? Not by convincing them that hamburgers are bad. That was the old way. That\u2019s how democracy worked. You would tell people something, if they believed they did it, if they didn\u2019t believe you, they didn\u2019t. But it turns out that\u2019s too time-consuming. The new model is we just use pharmaceuticals. Your kids are getting uppity? Dope them out, and they\u2019ll obey. \u00a0Liao proposes a nationwide system like that, a pill that would make people nauseous at the sight of red meat. Given that climate change is an \"existential threat,\" that\u2019s limiting our time on earth to 20 years, or 12 years, or 6 months, or pick your exaggeration, it\u2019s hard to imagine a pill like that would soon become mandatory. Sound like a dystopian fantasy? It\u2019s not. Liao is deadly serious. He said so at the \"World Science Festival.\" \u00a0\u00a0Again, says the bioethicist, \"human engineering\" is the answer. But wait a second, you ask. Human engineering? That\u2019s kind of creepy. Didn\u2019t we decide this kind of thing in Europe 80 years ago, and at the time, didn\u2019t we agree we\u2019re not going to do that ever again? True. But bioethicists have short memories apparently. And in any case, climate change is a pressing emergency. We don\u2019t have time to consider the consequences of our response to this existential crisis. \u00a0So here\u2019s an idea, said Liao at the World Science Festival: let\u2019s fiddle with the human genome to see if we can make human children smaller than they are now. A race of dwarfs. They\u2019d eat less, and be cheaper to transport. And that would reduce greenhouse gasses.\u00a0Imagine if we had smaller children. Little tiny children. Think of how little they would emit in greenhouse gasses. Think about how easy it would be to pick them up, juggle them around, control them. All we need to do is experiment on human children. And we can solve climate change. That was at a public conference five years ago. Nobody said anything. That\u2019s where we are. Surprised? You shouldn\u2019t be. In fact, it\u2019s less ghoulish than some of the things happening in labs right now. This is what science looks like when it's been completely decoupled from wisdom, decency and Christianity. It\u2019s a science fiction novel come to life, except it\u2019s real.

{"id": null, "body": "\n        File photo: Physicist Stephen Hawking exits the stage during an announcement of the Breakthrough Starshot initiative with investor Yuri Milner in New York April 12, 2016. (REUTERS/Lucas Jackson) Earth could turn into a hothouse planet like Venus, with boiling oceans and acid rain, if humans don't curb irreversible climate change, physicist Stephen Hawking claimed in a recent interview.\"We are close to the tipping point, where  becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like , with a temperature of 250 degrees [Celsius], and raining sulfuric acid,\" he told , referring to the president's decision .But most climate experts say that scenario is a dramatic and implausible exaggeration: Relative to Venus, planet Earth is much farther from the sun and given its chemical makeup will never have such a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, so it could not likely reach temperatures of 482 degrees Fahrenheit (250 degrees C) that Hawking described in the interview, they say. []However, the general trend of runaway and catastrophic climate change is a real concern, experts said.\"Hawking is taking some rhetorical license here,\" Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University, told Live Science in an email. \"Earth is further away from the sun than Venus and likely cannot experience a runaway  in the same sense as Venus \u2014 i.e. a literal boiling away of the oceans. However Hawking's larger point \u2014 that we could render the planet largely uninhabitable for human civilization if we do not act to avert dangerous climate change \u2014 is certainly valid.\"Venus is the second planet from the sun and the brightest planet in the solar system; though the planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and desire, don't expect to take a trip to the balmy planet with your sweetheart anytime soon. Despite being the same size as Earth and having roughly the same  as our home planet, it's a far cry from our water-drenched planet. Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with temperatures reaching 870 degrees F (466 degrees C). The reason for these sweltering temperatures is Venus' thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere that is dotted with sulfuric acid clouds; the atmosphere traps much more heat than our own does. It is also much closer to the sun, meaning it absorbs much more solar radiation than Earth. Churning volcanoes add to Venus' reputation as an inferno. []The leading theory about how Venus came to be such a hellscape is that the planet got caught in a feedback loop, wherein the planet absorbed more solar radiation than it released, causing more water vapor to get trapped in its atmosphere. That, in turn, led to greater heat absorption, and runaway warming (also called a runaway greenhouse effect).\"Basically, Venus was in a state of heat stroke \u2014 the planet was in a warming state and it couldn't cool down,\" said Tyler Robinson, an astrobiologist at the University of Washington.Though most humans take for granted the relative constancy of an Earth-like climate, our planet has undergone dramatic changes in its 4.5-billion-year history. During the , around 2.5 billion years ago, photosynthetic cyanobacteria fueled a huge rise in oxygen in the atmosphere. Around 650 million years ago, the entire planet froze, in a phenomenon known as \" snowball Earth .\" And during the dinosaur age, the planet was, on average 18 degrees F (10 degrees C) hotter than it is now, with a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. And huge \"carbon excursions\" have led to massive extinctions in the past \u2014 such as the end-Permian extinction around 252 million years ago, when roughly 95 percent of sea life died out due to ocean acidification. [ Photo Timeline: How the Earth Formed ]So it's not unreasonable to contemplate the possibility of a runaway climate scenario, Robinson said. Still, most experts, including Robinson, see that possibility as incredibly unlikely.While in theory, a process similar to the one experienced on Venus could take place on Earth, the process would most likely occur over hundreds of millions of years, most experts believe, Robinson said. There are also very low odds that Earth's oceans could literally boil away like Venus' primeval oceans did, Robinson said.Earth, meanwhile, is protected from solar radiation by an atmosphere that is dramatically different from that of Venus.\"Venus' atmosphere is about 100 times thicker than Earth's atmosphere, and composed almost entirely of CO2 [carbon dioxide],\" Robinson said. By contrast, Earth's atmosphere is mostly molecular nitrogen and oxygen, with less than 0.04 percent coming from carbon dioxide, Robinson told Live Science in an email. [ Infographic: Earth's Atmosphere from Top to Bottom ]Without a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and the extra dose of solar radiation from the sun, only willful malice is likely to cause a runaway greenhouse scenario, said Kevin Zahnle, a space scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, who has analyzed runaway greenhouse projections for the planet.\"There is no rational expectation of a runaway [greenhouse effect] in the facts as we know them,\" Zahnle told Live Science in an email.For one, there were much warmer climates on Earth in the relatively recent past, such as during the Eocene epoch (between 56 million and 34 million years ago), and no signs of a runaway greenhouse effect, Zahnle said. At that time, CO2 levels were likely three times higher than they are now. Even imagining a future with cars, planes and air conditioning on full blast, no climate projections predict such high levels of CO2 in our atmosphere, he said.\"A runaway greenhouse effect is not in the cards,\" added Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.Of course, there is always the possibility of deliberate sabotage, Zahnle said.\"Dr. Evil might consider an engineering solution akin to the engineering solutions proposed to terraform Mars , but the scale of the effort would be stupendous,\" Zahnle said. \"You'd need fluorocarbons \u2014 so Dr. Evil would need to create a worldwide religion dedicated to the sacred use of hairspray and underarm deodorants,\" Zahnle said. (In the past, some consumer aerosol products contained fluorocarbons, though the U.S. has banned the ingredients in the late 1970s.)Nontheless, Earth doesn't have to become like Venus for life on Earth to become hellish.The Paris Agreement aimed to keep warming below 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) compared with preindustrial temperatures, but even reaching that level for sustained periods could cause changes that are already underway to completely disrupt ecosystems and farming, Trenberth told Live Science. [ Trump Pulls Out of Paris Climate Deal: 5 Likely Effects ]\"Trees will still grow but a different species is required. Or farming requires different crops,\" Trenberth said. \"That threatens the water and food supply.\"Food and water don't need to vanish, they just need to fall below demand and chaos breaks out, he said. \"This sort of thing is increasingly likely after about 2050, as it is likely we will go through 2 degrees Celsius during that decade,\" Trenberth said.It is also theoretically possible for CO2 levels to go even higher, Robinson said. If humans were to burn every last bit of fossil fuel on the planet, CO2 levels could rise to almost 10 times their current levels, Robinson said.\"Earth hasn't experienced CO2 levels this high in hundreds of millions of years, and the resulting sea-level change is likely hundreds of feet, so, say 'so long' to all your favorite coastal cities,\" Robinson said.", "headline": " Stephen Hawking: Earth could turn into hothouse planet like Venus ", "article_name": "stephen-hawking-earth-could-turn-into-hothouse-planet-like-venus", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/stephen-hawking-earth-could-turn-into-hothouse-planet-like-venus", "date_published": "2017-09-27 00:00:00", "article_length": 7626, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:28.834760"}

Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.) asked EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.\"I'm not familiar with the details of those plans, but I am familiar from reading the climate action plan that the president sees this as both a challenge and an economic opportunity,\" McCarthy replied.That exchange led to a testy retort by Ralph Hall (R-Tex.). \"You got a better answer than I received from Mrs. McCarthy about a year ago before the science committee,\" Hall told McCarthy. \"I may have asked you a question you didn't like and your answer was, \u2018I'm not in the business of creating jobs.\u2019\u201dCommittee Democrats, along with McCarthy and Moniz, set out to counter\u00a0Republican skepticism about the impact of climate change.\"The evidence is overwhelming and the science is clear,\" said Moniz. \"The threat from climate change is real and urgent.

More than 118,000 people have died in the U.S. due to the coronavirus and over 45 million Americans have filed for unemployment assistance. Communities have shut down entirely, and while officials are following public health guidelines to safely reopen, getting to a new normal will take time.Shutting down our  also significantly impacted emissions levels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates U.S. emissions could decline by more than 14 percent this year.And as the pandemic ravages health and economies worldwide, the International Energy Agency reports that global energy emissions may decline this year by almost 8 percent \u2013 the largest reduction ever and \u201ctwice as large as the combined total of all previous reductions since the end of World War II.\u201dStill, even with the pandemic driving major economic devastation and emissions declines, global emissions barely met the United Nations\u2019 target of cutting annual emissions by 7.6 percent. And, of course, developed countries like the United States are supposed to cut an even larger share, while the world allows China to continue to increase its emissions without consequence for the next decade.Simply put, even though the arbitrary U.N. climate standards may have been temporarily met in theory, it took pushing the global economy to the brink of collapse and jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions of Americans to do so.Unprecedented pandemics require a robust response, which is why Congress has passed the largest relief package in U.S. history to provide aid to American small business owners, workers, seniors and families.For Republicans in Congress, the answer to addressing climate change and bringing our country back to prosperity is clear: American innovation. \u00a0Unfortunately, some Democrats  COVID-19 is \u201ca dress rehearsal for addressing the catastrophic impacts of climate change.\u201d We agree, but it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.This financial devastation is a preview of Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal that is supposed to give us a socialist, emission-free utopia. For Republicans in Congress, the answer to addressing climate change and bringing our country back to prosperity is clear: American innovation. The Democrats have made clear the direction their party is headed. Their presumptive nominee for president, former Vice President Joe Biden, recently said in his climate platform that \u201cour environment and our economy are completely and totally connected,\u201d but added that, \u201cthe Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.\u201dWhile we agree the U.S. needs to utilize clean energy, lower emissions, update infrastructure, and work with our allies for a cleaner world, we vehemently disagree that shutting down our economy is the way to do it.It\u2019s no coincidence that the same communities that have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic are the ones that have suffered most because the economic devastation it has caused.Democrats are creating a false choice between combatting climate change and having a prosperous economy. We can have both, and America can supply the innovative technologies that will reduce global emissions. With millions of Americans already losing their jobs, we must find a better way to leave our world better than we found it.For example, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies promise to reduce emissions, create jobs and provide cleaner energy. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created tax credits for deploying CCUS infrastructure.According to the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Fossil Energy, the use of these credits could create 4.3 million to 6.1 million more jobs. Just recently the Internal Revenue Service\u00a0 guidance to help implement these tax credits, and now American innovators have even more incentive to utilize these technologies.Nuclear innovation also plays a role in not only reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also in our national security, energy independence and economic growth. Nuclear energy continues to be a safe, emissions-free energy source with a small footprint.The Trump administration recently  a comprehensive nuclear energy strategy to help the United States regain its nuclear energy leadership around the world \u2013 to the benefit of clean energy and national security.Unfortunately, Democrats have failed to take meaningful action to promote this vital energy source, even though it is essential for meeting emissions goals and maintaining America\u2019s security. We also must work to overcome the supply chain threats that have been underscored during the COVID-19 pandemic. The only way to maintain our edge in innovation and achieve our goals of a cleaner, healthier and safer world is by securing our energy and manufacturing.The good news is there are bipartisan  that could be passed today to implement workable climate policies that will ensure a robust and prosperous economy.As an Eagle Scout, I learned to \u201cleave a campsite better than I found it,\u201d and those words have stuck with me as a member of Congress. We have learned during these unprecedented times that the American people are resilient. We need policies that can bring relief and results \u2013 and shutting down our economy long-term cannot be one of them.", "headline": "Rep.

{"id": null, "body": "'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host slams the Green New Deal after a winter storm freezes Texas wind turbinesThe  has come, believe it or not, to the state of Texas. How's it working out so far?Well, the good news is all that alternative energy seems to have had a remarkable effect on the climate. Sunday\u00a0night, parts of  got the\u00a0temperatures that we typically see in . In fact, they were the same as they were in Alaska. So global warming is no longer a pressing concern in Houston.\u00a0The bad news is, they don't have electricity. The windmills froze, so the power grid failed. Millions of Texans woke up Monday morning having to boil their water because with no electricity, it couldn't be purified.The ironically named Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the grid, had no solution to any of this. They simply told people to stop using so much power to keep warm. So in Houston, hundreds of shivering Texans headed to the convention center like refugees to keep from freezing to death. Some Texans almost certainly did freeze to death. Later this week, we'll likely learn just how many more were killed as they tried to keep warm with jury-rigged heaters and barbecues and car exhaust.That happens every time when the power goes out; even advanced societies become primitive and dangerous, and people die. We've seen it happen repeatedly in California for years now, rolling blackouts in a purportedly First World state that is slipping steadily into chaos.But who saw that coming in Texas? If there's one thing you would think Texas would be able to do, it's keep the lights on. Most electricity comes from natural gas and Texas produces more of that than any place on the continent. There are huge natural gas deposits all over the state. Running out of energy in Texas is like starving to death at the grocery store: You can only do it on purpose, and\u00a0Texas did.Rather than celebrate and benefit from their state's vast natural resources, politicians took the fashionable route and became recklessly reliant on so-called alternative energy, meaning windmills. Fifteen years ago, there were virtually no wind farms in Texas. Last year, roughly a quarter of all electricity generated in the state came from wind. Local politicians were pleased by this. They bragged about it like there was something virtuous about destroying the landscape and degrading the power grid. Just last week, Republican Gov.\u00a0Greg Abbott proudly accepted something called the Wind Leadership Award, given with gratitude by Tri Global Energy, a company getting rich from green energy.So it was all working great until the day it got cold outside. The windmills failed like the silly fashion accessories they are, and people in Texas died.\u00a0This is not to beat up on the state of Texas --\u00a0it's a great state, actually --\u00a0but to give you some sense of\u00a0what's about to happen to you.Here's President Biden last month:\"Climate crisis\", \"existential threat\", \"ambitious plan\".\u00a0You hear those phrases a lot and you'll notice that they are all suspiciously non-precise. So what do they mean for you? Will they mean higher energy prices? For starters, gas prices are\u00a0already up, in case you haven't noticed. Electricity will follow. Higher costs hurt the weakest, inflation always does, but it's worse than that. Green energy inevitably means blackouts. Someday that may change as technology progresses, but as of right now and given the current state of technology, green energy means a less reliable power grid. It means failures like the ones we're seeing now in Texas. That's not a talking point, that\u00a0is true. It's science. So of course, they're denying it.Here's our new climate czar taking a quick break from  to lecture the rest of us about a topic he personally knows nothing about:\u00a0Private sector jobs and how more windmills are going to generate tons of them:The old plan, you'll remember, was coding. All the\u00a0guys in pickup trucks were going to learn to code and run the Internet\u00a0after we sent their jobs to China. In the end, of course, we just imported people from China to code, so that didn't actually happen. But John Kerry has another idea:\u00a0High school-educated rural people are going to be wind turbine technicians. So what they used to do with transmissions, whatever that was, they're going to do with windmills;\u00a0put bearings in them or lube them\u00a0or something.Now, it's possible that John Kerry actually believes that. Maybe he's never been within 20 feet of a wind turbine. He definitely doesn't live near one. They don't have wind farms in Aspen or Martha's Vineyard and they're not getting them.  out of sight of his summer house on Nantucket. That's hypocritical, but it's not surprising.People who support wind farms, as a rule, live very far from wind farms. People who live near wind farms have a totally different view, and why wouldn't they? How would you like a massive power plant in your backyard humming and buzzing and chopping up birds? That's what a wind turbine is. If you're ever in rural America, go see one for yourself. You'll be shocked by how awful it is once you get up close. Your first thought may be, \"This is supposed to be good for the environment.\"Wind farms are one of those ideas you can only support if you don't know too much about them, and maybe that's why there's never been mass popular support for them.\u00a0 No large group of citizens has ever demanded that some Goldman Sachs company destroy the natural environment with Chinese-made windmills that don't work when it's cold out. No one anywhere has ever said that, but it doesn't matter because green energy is the ultimate inside game. A tiny number of people profit from it due to\u00a0government subsidies and regulated prices. Everyone else gets a moral lecture about climate change and anyone who complains about any of it gets The problem is that\u00a0demagogues\u00a0like Cory Booker\u00a0have no earthly idea what a wind farm is. They don't know how to run a power grid, or anything else, for that matter. They talk, they brag, but they don't build anything, much less fix or maintain it. They can't, they have no skills. If you don't believe that, take a look at what they have done to our cities.Not a single major American city is prettier or more functional than it was in 1950. The parks that previous generations so lovingly built are filled with vagrants and junkies. The monuments they constructed are covered with spray paint. Public transportation is a disgrace. It's filthy, the streets are dangerous. Are you really surprised that Cory Booker was once the mayor of Newark, N.J.? You shouldn't be.Cory Booker couldn't fix your ice maker, much less understand your wind farm. None of these people can. It's bad enough that they control the sociology department over at your local community college. But the power grid? No way. They can't get within a hundred yards of it.", "headline": "Tucker Carlson: The great Texas climate catastrophe is heading your way", "article_name": "tucker-carlson-texas-green-new-deal-climate-catastrophe", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-texas-green-new-deal-climate-catastrophe", "date_published": "2021-02-15 00:00:00", "article_length": 6858, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:33.131728"}

A draft of the report leaked in early September acknowledged that trend and put it bluntly: We simply can\u2019t explain it.\u201cModels do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10\u201315 years.\u201dBut  released Friday morning by the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) strips out the failure of models and explains away the downward trend.[pullquote]\u201cDue to natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends,\u201d the new report reads.A later reference suggests volcanoes, oceans and solar activity may have affected the warming, although the IPCC said it wasn't confident in that finding.The U.N. arm also acknowledges another possibility: Maybe it was wrong.\"There may also be ... an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing,\" the new report admits.Climate skeptics have seized upon the change in world weather patterns, some citing it as evidence that global warming itself has decelerated or even stopped. Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said the slowdown was a far larger issue than the report shows.\u201cUnless global temperature will begin to rise again in the next few years, the IPCC is very likely going to suffer an existential blow to its credibility,\u201d he said. Judith Curry, professor and chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, was even blunter.\u201cIPCC has thrown down the gauntlet \u2013 if the pause continues beyond 15 years (well it already has), they are toast.\u201dMany governments had objections over how the issue was treated in earlier drafts and some had called for it to be deleted altogether. In a Friday morning presentation of its findings, Thomas Stocker, co-chair of the group that wrote the report, defended that decision, the Associated Press reported.\"An old rule says that climate-relevant trends should not be calculated for periods less than around 30 years,\" Stocker said.Many scientists say the slowdown reflects random climate fluctuations and an unusually hot year, 1998, picked as a starting point for charting temperatures. Another leading hypothesis is that heat is settling temporarily in the oceans.Stocker said there wasn't enough literature on \"this emerging question.\"The IPCC said the evidence of climate change has grown thanks to more and better observations, a clearer understanding of the climate system and improved models to analyze the impact of rising temperatures.\"Our assessment of the science finds that the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amount of snow and ice has diminished, the global mean sea level has risen and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,\" said Qin Dahe, co-chair of the working group that wrote the report.Yet recent reports have stressed that climate models have failed to accurately predict global temperatures.

Out of 117 predictions, the study\u2019s author told FoxNews.com, 3 were roughly accurate and .On average, the predictions forecasted two times more global warming than actually occurred.\"It's a real problem ... it shows that there really is something that needs to be fixed in the climate models,\" climate scientist John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, told FoxNews.com at the time.", "headline": "UN climate change report dismisses slowdown in global warming", "article_name": "un-climate-change-report-dismisses-slowdown-in-global-warming", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/un-climate-change-report-dismisses-slowdown-in-global-warming", "date_published": "2015-10-20 00:00:00", "article_length": 4135, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:34.940317"}

Jeff?JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and this is just coming down the wire here. It's officially called a \"Stay at Home\" order. And essentially, the - the idea here is to keep people from mingling, from being out together, and doing things that aren't absolutely necessary.Now, under this order, which goes into effect tonight, things that will stay open are essentials like gas stations, pharmacy, grocery stores, things that provide food, banks, Laundromat, laundry service.Things that might not be able to do under this order, especially here in the City of L.A., because Mayor Garcetti announced something similar, a little bit earlier today, really, you shouldn't be going to work, here in L.A., unless it's one of these essential services, and really shouldn't be out visiting anybody at a hospital right now because that could put you further at risk.One other thing that the Governor announced on this was that hospitalizations could surge, so that's part of it. They're worried about how the impact of this virus could have on hospitals, could surge up to 19,500 patients, which is well beyond capacity. Again, this is a developing story.

Between March 2nd and March 14th, 10.4 million lab tests were put into the healthcare system, 45,000 people have been tested through the CDC, remember, I was complaining about the CDC, well 45,000, 63,000 have already been tested by commercial labs, 20,000 tests already resolved. Hundreds of thousands more are coming in the next week.Look, the President wanted results. He's impatient for results, and he got them.

We don't want anyone to die. But that's at least 50 percent lower as a mortality rate than has been previously reported in many different outlets. Now, let's hope that number holds over time, and especially as more people are tested worldwide, even those who are asymptomatic.But perhaps the best news of all is about a drug I brought to your attention on Monday night. Now, at first, it kind of seemed to me, I'm a little skeptical, all that, it seemed too good to be true. But the results in France, in China, and beyond, have been nothing short of impressive.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: What if there's already a cheap and widely available medication that's on the market to treat the virus? Well, according to a new study, there is such a drug. It's called Chloroquine.All of these different antivirals have been shown fairly promising in some of the early trials, some of them in vitro. Are those the types of antivirals for the treatment, not the vaccine that you all are looking at?DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Right. Yes, we have to be careful, Laura, that we don't assume something works based on an anecdotal report that's not controlled. And I refer specifically to Hydroxychloroquine.ALEX AZAR, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Laura, you've been great about calling attention to this drug.President Trump is absolutely adamant that we leave no stone unturned in bringing therapies, cures, vaccines, to the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well The Angle's persistence paid off because today President Trump made this announcement.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A drug called Chloroquine, and some people would add to it \"Hydroxy,\" Hydroxychloroquine.It is known as a Malaria drug, and it's been around for a long time, and it's very powerful.It's shown very encouraging, very, very encouraging early results. And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, after this happened, the drug company Bayer donated 3 million of the pills - of this particular drug to the Trump Administration. Now, although the FDA still has not approved the drug for use as a treatment for COVID-19, doctors here can still prescribe it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEPHEN HAHN, COMMISSIONER OF FOOD AND DRUGS: That's a drug that the President has directed us to take a closer look at, as to whether an expanded-use approach to that could be done to actually see if that benefits patients.And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial, a large, pragmatic clinical trial, to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered and - asked and answered.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well I have a feeling and given the fact that most of the country is locked down right now that a controlled study of, I don't know, 2,000 patients could be organized pretty quickly, given what's at stake here.I'll happily volunteer. If you're looking for volunteers, OK, I'll volunteer.The FDA - FDA needs to hop onto this pronto. It looks like they are. That's great news.Now, seeing the President snap his team into action, and in the process, harnessing the full power of the government, all of the government, the private sector, and our citizens, who are doing great acts of selflessness during this entire crisis, it gives all of us hope in this really difficult time.As we've done with polio, and the measles, and so much else, we'll find the answers we need. We've beaten diseases in the past, and we'll do it again. And that's The Angle.So, how beneficial is Hydroxychloroquine? My next guest says doctors are already using this treatment in the United States successfully. Joining me now is Dr. William Grace, Oncologist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.Dr. Grace, great to see you tonight. How big a deal would approving Chloroquine for the Coronavirus be?DR. WILLIAM GRACE, LENOX HILL ONCOLOGIST: Well it's - everybody is using it now off-label. We have a surge of Coronavirus-19 patients in throughout the Metropolitan area of New York. And the problem is these patients are coming in quite sick.And when they get to a very difficult respiratory status, the doctors are using Hydroxychloroquine with or without a drug called Zithromax or Azithromycin, and that's showing tremendous activity. And we have not had a death in our Hospital. We have probably close to a 100 patients, and not had any deaths.But I've talked to many of my colleagues at other hospitals in New York, and they also are using Hydroxychloroquine, although the supplies are running down. So, any kind of supplements to those supplies would be much appreciated.INGRAHAM: Now, Dr. Grace, when you heard the President today mention this, and then he, you know, he maybe got a little hesitant of the FDA approve - well the FDA hasn't approved. But just so everyone understands tonight, that doesn't mean doctors can't use the drug in - in medical settings.As you just said, it's already being used, correct?GRACE: Yes. In the - in the trenches, we're all using it, especially for desperately ill people.INGRAHAM: Yes.GRACE: Yes.INGRAHAM: OK. So--GRACE: We're not using it on everybody. But we're using it on those people who show major respiratory compromise.INGRAHAM: OK. And so, with this controlled study, we'll see both the effects of Hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic, a preventive, and as a treatment, correct?GRACE: Yes. There are people out in the West Coast who are looking at it in people who are virus-positive, but don't show many of the symptoms, and they're looking for the clearance of the virus by this drug.We think it works in two ways. As you know, the death rate goes up, as the age goes up.And what I think is that the more mature your immune response, the more likely you are to have a, what we call, a cytokine storm, which means that people with viral pneumonias die because their lungs fill up with fluids, largely from an immune response.And this drug works, not only inhibiting virus replication, but also inhibits the immune response, so you don't get the tremendous amount of inflammation. That's why the drug is also used in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.INGRAHAM: There - apparently, there's - WHO, the World Health Organization has organized a study called Solidarity, and it includes 10 countries, Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, and a bunch more, so they're - they're doing a global study on this, and it's already underway.So, we should be able to get answers on this pretty quickly. That could be a game-changer if what you're seeing, what your - your colleagues are seeing in Lenox Hill pans out, because what they're seeing in China and France is stunning - are stunning results with this drug.GRACE: That's true. And I'm hoping that what will happen, the data will come down quickly. We'll get everybody on Hydroxychloroquine, go back to work, and put the nation back together again.INGRAHAM: Now, that would be nice. That's - that's what we're trying to get to because America doesn't want to stay behind closed doors.Dr. Grace, before we let you go, people talk about the mortality rate. And that's been confusing because of the denominator.GRACE: Exactly.INGRAHAM: As people say, we don't - we have to know what the real denominator is. Explain that.GRACE: Well we don't have enough test kits.And we didn't have them here largely because the CDC tried to internalize, and make the test kits all part of their program, rather than having it throughout the entire private sector. And we're paying a price for that.And now, once we have enough test kits out, and get the public private sectors producing these kits, we'll have - be able to get that denominator down pat.INGRAHAM: And that means the mortality rate invariably will go down because a lot of those asymptomatic people will test positive, correct?GRACE: Exactly. Exactly.INGRAHAM: I should have stayed in Med. I should have stayed in pre-Med, Dr. Grace. I got out of that really quick. This is more - this is so fascinating to me.Thank you so much for what you did to explain it. It's complicated stuff. You made it really easy to understand. Dr. Grace, thanks so much.GRACE: Good to talk to you, Laura. Have a good night.INGRAHAM: All right.And remember the other day, or the other night, when I said there's still a lot we don't know about this virus. Well we're now learning something else about it, and it's something quite troubling, The Coronavirus is associated with heart complications.Joining me now is Dr. Michael Orlov, Cardiologist at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston.Doctor, how is the Coronavirus associated with heart problems, and what are you seeing with all of the Chinese research that's coming out, just on that aspect of it?DR. MICHAEL ORLOV, ST. ELIZABETH'S MEDICAL CENTER: Well Laura, this is fascinating problem because the initial data from China showed that the effect of Coronavirus on the heart is relatively small, so it was seen in about 8 percent of patients, who had severe, severe cardiac problems. And lesser - lesser cardiac problems were observed a little bit more frequently.However, that data may be changing coming out of Italy and Europe where we hear more alarming results that cardiac complications may be more common. And also, in the cases in the United States, we see late complications on the heart.So, this is alarming. This is unknown. We don't have the data. The data is coming. But when something is unknown, and alarming, that obviously creates fear. So, we need the data to clarify that, and alleviate the fears, and that will probably clear the path to go forward.However, having said that, cardiac complications are also very complex, and require complex treatment, and complex devices, to help to support the body while it's fighting the virus, and those devices are in relatively short supply. We need to be prepared to be quickly equipped with them, mobilize those--INGRAHAM: Heart, lung machines.ORLOV: --heart, lung machines, exactly, to support the body. And we don't know how many of those we need.INGRAHAM: Dr. Orlov?ORLOV: So, that's a problem.INGRAHAM: Another - another point that has been raised is the President's response today, where he specifically mentions this drug that you and I have talked about, Hydroxychloroquine, talked about it with Dr. Grace, it's already being used.And one patient was described as Lazarus getting up after - after he was - he was like on death's door. And they started getting a protocol of Hydroxychloroquine at Lenox Hill, and it suddenly like Lazarus, up from the grave. I mean that's an actual case.But that having been said, people are criticizing the Administration for this. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. IRWIN REDLENER, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: The President should not be talking about that, you know.I don't care who the President is whether it's - this is not a political issue and, you know, there's no President that should be out there talking about the efficacy of a medication in a serious crisis like this.What difference does it make what a political leader is saying about a particular medicine?KATY TUR, MSNBC HOST: Got it.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Do you agree with that? I mean the President shouldn't mention any promising drug because, heaven knows, we don't need any hope these days?ORLOV: Yes. I think the promise should be made from the highest podium. I - I disagree with that.And a promising drug should be quickly tested and checked. There are some minor possibilities of cardiac complications with Hydroxychloroquine. But it can be monitored. And if this is a miracle drug, it should be quickly disseminated, and made available.My concern is that Hydroxychloroquine is supposedly manufactured only by one producer. And we need to make, if it's effective, we need to make it quickly available, like many, many other things that are lacking, that are missing.I was going to bring up some simple things because simple things work. And miracle drugs are perfect. But we just need to do simple measures like public gatherings, people should observe that. That's very important.Also, personal protective equipment, need to be made available. In the frontlines, we don't have enough. This is just missing again because the manufacturing is done elsewhere. It's overseas.And we don't have enough masks, enough other protective equipment. It should be made available quickly along with a miracle drug.INGRAHAM: Dr. Orlov--ORLOV: This would be life-saving.INGRAHAM: Dr. Orlov, it's great to see you tonight.And I know there's a lot of government red tape that the President has already cut.And there's a lot of hospital red tape, because hospitals have gotten, you know, these big conglomerates. It's not the, you know, small community, lot of these are really big. And I know you've been urging for a lot of the hospital red tape to be cut, to get these supplies in as well.So, thank you so much, Dr. Orlov. It's great to see you tonight.ORLOV: Thank you.INGRAHAM: And coming up, Senate Republicans have a plan to fix the economy, they say, but it is really, really expensive. What can Trump do to ensure that these Stimulus packages don't end up backfiring? Steve Moore weighs in, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY.: It is critical that we move swiftly and boldly to begin to stabilize our economy, preserve Americans' jobs, get money to workers and families, and keep up our fight on the health front.That is exactly what our proposal will do.These are not ordinary policies. This is no ordinary time.Senate Republicans want to put cash in the hands of the American people.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today proposing a third Coronavirus economic aid package. Now, his plan will likely cost more than $1 trillion. It includes sending checks out to every American, up to $1,200 per person.Now, relief is needed, we all know that, because many Americans are already filing for unemployment benefits, a looming recession, some say it's already here.The Labor Department is reporting now that 280,000 people lost their jobs in the last week. At this rate, we could stand to lose over 1 million jobs, I can't even say that, it's so heartbreaking, just over the next month. And experts are predicting job losses could total 3.5 million by the summer.We better get going on these antivirals.McConnell's bill also earmarks over $350 billion for loans to businesses, which he insists is not a bailout to the special interests. He's carving out nearly $60 billion just for the airline industry. Do they need taxpayer support? Even if it's a loan, is that better?And remember, this bill still needs to get through a Democrat-controlled House. But they do say they're all working together.So, if their last Coronavirus bill is any guide, they're going to try to fill McConnell's plan in the House with all sorts of little goody - goody grab bags, a Christmas tree, put their ornaments on it and giveaways to their friends.But there's also another risk, and it's something that endangered our economic recovery during the Great Depression.Joining me now is Amity Shlaes, Chairman of the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, Author of \"Great Society,\" and Steve Moore, Senior Economic Adviser to Trump 2016 Campaign, and Author of \"Trumponomics.\"Amity, I told everybody you're going to come back tonight, OK, because you were - you were telling us last night, and I rudely cut you off that we should avoid doing the things that FDR did in the 30s that hurt our recovery. What were you referring to, specifically?AMITY SHLAES, CALVIN COOLIDGE PRESIDENTIAL FOUNDATION: Yes. I wasn't too happy to hear Senator McConnell say \"No ordinary time\" because that is a reference to the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, which is what we did in the 1930s.And what President Roosevelt did, as lovable as and inspiring as it was, prolonged the Great Depression. It put the adjective \"Great\" into the phrase because we had unemployment for 10 percent (ph). Think of that in contrast to now, and our Dow did not come back the whole decade.Imagine if we told ourselves now the Dow will never get back to where it was three weeks ago. And so, we're really in the rocking chair, you know. That's awfully disconcerting. And bottom line, what happened was the government intervened too much.INGRAHAM: Steve Moore, look, people are desperate, and they're looking at these jobless claims. It is - it is just a month ago we're the strongest economy in the world, strongest economy in decades.And now, here we are, shuttered in place, or whatever we're calling it, \"Safe space, safe distancing,\" and people are out of work, can't go anywhere, can't do anything, can't spend money on anything.What is the rest pathway, Steve? And is - are they on the right track?STEVE MOORE, SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISER TRUMP 2016, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION ECONOMIST: Well, you know, I'm sort of frustrated with - with this whole Stimulus idea because Stimulus has never worked. In fact, I have a piece in The Wall Street Journal on Saturday with the title \"Stimulus never works.\"Amity is right about what happened in the 1930s. By the way, there's a whole mythology about how wonderful the New Deal was because the Left wrote the history books, and that's what everybody learns.But Amity is exactly right. It didn't work in the 1930s. We had double- digit unemployment throughout Franklin Roosevelt's Presidency.And then, of course, we tried this, as you recall, you know, Laura, back in '90 - 2009, when Barack Obama was President. Remember, Laura, the shovel- ready projects, and the $830 billion we were going to spend, which was going to spring the economy back to life?And - and remember, by the way, Joe Biden had, remember, his Summer of Recovery. It never happened. It was the worst recovery from a recession we've had, going back to the Great Depression. Even by Obama's own numbers, the economy would have been better, and would have healed faster if we had not spent any of that money.So, my first advice to Donald Trump is, don't do what we did in 2009, under Obama, because it didn't work. And - and, by the way, if he puts in place policies that actually hurt the economy, and some of these policies would, you know, you're talking about President Joe Biden, he's got to have a growth plan.Laffer and I and - and Steve Forbes and I have talked about the idea of suspending the payroll tax for the rest of the year to give businesses an incentive to hire more workers because it would be a tax cut for every one of the 26 million small businesses in the country.INGRAHAM: But what if people don't have any money? But Steve, what if people have no money to spend? I mean--MOORE: Well, look, we have what we have--INGRAHAM: What do - what do people do?MOORE: We have programs already for people, for example, who've lost their job, unemployment insurance. You know, it's we had - I had dinner tonight with my seventh and eighth grade stepsons.And I asked them, what do you think about the idea of the government just giving $1,000 to everyone? And The first one said, why would anybody work if the government is going to give you free money? And the second one said, wouldn't that be inflationary? If a seventh and eighth grader can figure that out, why can't members of Congress?INGRAHAM: I'm still getting my kids to try to do their basic math facts. That's pretty good.MOORE: It's not complicated, right. Economics is not complicated.INGRAHAM: Amity, but you know the pressure people are under to say, OK, we have got to come together. We have just got to work together, we have to do something. So it's always the people who are asking the questions and always vilified. If you ask us a question about a lockdown or write an editorial, as they did in \"The Journal\" today, basically saying rethinking the coronavirus shutdown, you are vilified. This is \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board opinion piece, saying what if this is wrong?AMITY SHLAES, CALVIN COOLIDGE PRESIDENTIAL FOUNDATION: Laura, there are answers to our economic problems that are much more dramatic and useful than what the administration is proposing or the Senate is proposing. You say you can't say things, and you are absolutely correct. An example, what if we cut the capital gains tax by half and forget about the surcharge, just go from 20 to 10? What if we talked about that? You would instantly be attacked for helping the rich. But every economist, including all the way over on the left among the Marxists, knows that if you cut the capital gains tax rate by half, then international investment would raise our stock market tomorrow. It is just that they don't dare say it. The Republicans act like Democrats in elections. And it's unfortunate. There are many more steps to growth we could take, we just have to be a little bit braver than we are currently being. The Republican Party is almost indistinguishable, unfortunately, from the Democratic Party. I work on Calvin Coolidge, and he had a completely different vision, let me say.INGRAHAM: Steve?MOORE: OK, look, I think this is a very dangerous situation. I just heard a report what they are doing in California, basically lockdown the whole state, telling people they can't leave their homes without government permission. This is a very dangerous, almost Orwellian situation we are in right now.And I happen to agree with that \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial. If this goes on where we have people locked down, they can't go to work --INGRAHAM: Social unrest.MOORE: -- for more than three week, you are talking about economic damage that would be in the trillions of dollars. And we have to ask this question, is it worth trillions of dollars of losses? Think of human suffering in terms of the lost income, the lost life savings, is that worth it to deal with this? It is a question worth asking because I'm starting to think maybe we should get people back to work as fast as we can.INGRAHAM: It's a question of, if you are locked down for months and you can't go anywhere, you can't talk to anybody. You can't really see anyone close up. You can't -- a friend of mine said that is not America.MOORE: It's not.INGRAHAM: If we are here in two months and we can't leave our homes, that is not really America. So people are beginning to already ask that question and we haven't even got through a week of this. So imagine three weeks or four weeks or five weeks. I think it's good to ask questions and do smart things and common sense. Guys, great to see you tonight, thanks so much.MOORE: Thank you.INGRAHAM: And up next, the coronavirus is making everyone miserable except for -- well, sort of. Climate activists are happy about one part of it. We are going to tell you why before a rational environmentalist responds. Don't go away.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: Shutting down entire industries and then forcing people to stay behind closed doors is terrible for the economy, for our mental well-being and our standard of living. That must be why climate change activists are celebrating. Leftist cheerleaders at CNN write \"There's an unlikely beneficiary of coronavirus -- the planet.\" USA Today\u00a0asks \"Could the coronavirus actually be saving lives in some parts of the world because of reduced pollution?\"And here is what the architect of the U.N. Paris Accord had to say, \"One thing that I think is actually very positive, if we really sustained several months of reduced travel, we may realize that we don't have to travel as much. Can this have actual behavioral change impacts? Maybe, and let us hope.\"Joining me now is Mike Shellenberger, president of Environmental Progress. Mike, emissions are down, but people are getting pretty miserable and economies are in free fall. So is this really their vision of what a healthy society looks like?MIKE SHELLENBERGER, PRESIDENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS: Unfortunately for some of our antihuman environmental brothers and sisters, I think this is a model for the kind of future they'd like to live. But I think it is not a model that most people want to live.And the thing we forget is that carbon emissions peaked in the United States over a decade and a half ago. They have actually declined by 35 percent when you look at the emissions from electricity production, mostly thanks to the fracking, natural gas revolution. So if you are looking for a model for how to deal with claimant change, how to reduce carbon emissions and improve the environment, you want a lot of economic growth and prosperity. That's what brings us cleaner forms of energy.INGRAHAM: Christiane Amanpour over at CNN tonight was -- well, she wanted to remind us of the silver lining.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: If there is a silver lining to this crisis, it's visible in the skies above China. The dramatic slowdown in manufacturing and driving has caused a reduction in carbon emissions. We have all seen these NASA satellite images which show the improvement in China's air quality.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: CNN, though, it was PBS and it was Monday, but you get the point. So they are showing a lot of these satellite images, and it is Italy before and after. I think of Italy the people before and after, fewer people after coronavirus, but again, some of the most extreme elements of the environmental lobbyist, and I'm a conservationist, I'm an outdoors person, everybody know that. I was hiking today with my kids, I love the outdoors. I hate people who litter, but they actually seem to be happier the less we are doing. The less we are out doing, traveling, seeing the world. They don't really want us to see the world.SHELLENBERGER: Yes, I think that is really sad. I think what you see with a lot of people that are celebrating this moment, and I see it online, some people saying that humans are the virus, and that the virus is eliminating the human cancer on the earth. I think that is a very minority view, it's a very dark view.I think the truth is that economic growth and lifting people out of poverty has been the most important way to reduce air pollution, to reduce humankind's negative impacts on the natural environment. The truth is that air pollution has been in decline in the United States since the late 1960s. Carbon emissions, obviously, peaked over a decade and a half ago. In Europe, carbon emissions peaked in the 70s.The good news is that the switch to natural gas and nuclear means that it's unlikely that temperatures are going to get very high. It is probably going to peak under three degrees temperature increase since preindustrial times. So I think this current situation is a terrible example to use for what it means to protect the environment.INGRAHAM: Ron Klain, who used to work for Obama, a top White House official, said that the virus and climate change were somehow linked. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RON KLAIN, FORMER OBAMA EBOLA RESPONSE COORDINATOR: There is one more thing we can do to reduce the risk of spread from animals to humans, and that's combat climate change. Climate change is driving this problem to some extent. Climate change has a lot, a lot, a lot of bad effects. One we don't think about very often is its effect as a driver of these epidemics. But it certainly is making this risk on this go up as a plan they.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Have you heard anything about that? The wet markets and the eating bats or other animals or whatever the heck they did to have this virus become such a global problem is climate change? I'm not following that.SHELLENBERGER: There's always an argument to be made that you could worsen some disease epidemics with warmer temperatures, but the fact of the matter is, nobody thinks climate change caused the 1918 flu which killed 50 million to 100 million people. I haven't heard many people claiming that there is any causal connection. But what you said is exactly right. Who would have thought that the wet live markets in China would be a major source of global chaos, of this economic challenges we're going to be having of mass death. But that is the reality, and experts have been warning against Chinese markets, those live markets where the animals are on top of each other. They're very unsanitary. We have been worrying about those for two decades now.So I think one of the thing that ought to come out of this is that there ought to be some effort internationally to make sure that countries get rid of those markets which are breeding grounds for dangerous viruses like these, and help countries move towards more modern meat production and consumption.INGRAHAM: Thank you so much, Mike, great to see you tonight.And coming up, a prisoner at Rikers Island has contracted the coronavirus. Wait until you see Bill de Blasio responded to that one. But more importantly, what do prison guards think about letting inmates run free. We'll tell you, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: This is a Fox News alert. California Governor Gavin Newsom ordering everyone in the state to stay at home during the coronavirus outbreak. Fox's Jeff Paul is live from our West Coast Newsroom with all the details. Jeff?JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Laura, this is a major step by officials here in California to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus. It's a decision that will impact the lives of the 40 million people who call this state home. The order is mandating residents to remain in their homes and stop their social interactions. Governor Gavin Newsom stating one of his biggest concerns at the moment, hospitals becoming overrun with the sick.The state projects more than 25 million people in California will be infected with the coronavirus over an eight-week period. And in a letter to President Trump, Gavin Newsom has requested the deployment of the U.S. Navy's Mercy hospital to the Port of Los Angeles to help those who might get sick.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): A state as large as ours, a nation-state, is many parts. But at the end of the day we are one body. There's a mutuality and there's a recognition of our interdependence that requires of this moment that we direct a statewide order for people to stay at home. That directive goes into force and effect this evening, and we were confident, we are confident that the people of the state of California will abide by it and do the right thing. They'll meet this moment, they'll step up.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAUL: Essential services will still operate. These include things like grocery stores, media outlets, gas stations, banks, hardware stores, home repair professionals, and laundromats. Restaurants can stay open if they prepare food for delivery or carry out, but the big push is for people to stay away from each other and only be out if necessary. Laura?INGRAHAM: Jeff, wow, 25 million, he said, will be infected. I asked Anthony Fauci that the other night. I said the reports are that half of all Americans will get infected, and he kind of pooh-poohed that and said that is not right. So we are getting all sorts of projections here and making a lot of assumptions based on these projections. But Jeff, this is wild news. Thank you so much for this tonight, appreciate it.PAUL: You bet.INGRAHAM: And New York City has more than 3,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus which now includes an intimate at Rikers Island. So of course, Mayor de Blasio is using it as an excuse to do what, to release dozens of prisoners.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, D-N.Y.: The cases are being reviewed by the NYPD and the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice, and as they reach agreement on an individual case, we start the process to release them. Forty inmates, 40 inmates have been put on a list. We are awaiting signoff depending on the case from the relevant district attorney and/or the state of New York.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Now, I do want to note that four corrections officers at Rikers have also tested positive for the coronavirus. Joining me now is Elias Husamudeen is president of the Corrections Officers Benevolent Association. Elias, it's great to see you tonight. Should we be letting these inmates out? Right now it's only 40, so what is wrong with that?ELIAS HUSAMUDEEN, COBA PRESIDENT: Absolutely not. You cannot solve a public health crisis by creating a public safety crisis. I don't know who would think that that is a good idea. The best way to solve a public health crisis in the jails is by giving correctional officers the supplies and the tools and the things that we need to actually address this. And this is what we have been fighting for and asking city hall and asking the mayor to give us. We need supplies. We need gloves. We need masks. We need the things that we can use to actually keep the health problem inside of the jail and not have people running around the street creating a public safety issue. They are in jail for a reason.INGRAHAM: Can you tell us anything about the level of supplies that you have and your officers have at Rikers Island?HUSAMUDEEN: Currently what we have is not adequate. If we should have an epidemic, if this thing should break out, the supplies that we have won't last. So we have been asking, like so many other unions in the city, we need more masks. We have been asking for masks like this particular mask, which is a mask -- we have the letter N95 that everybody has, but those are only good for a eight hours. This particular mask that we're asking for has a five-year shelf life. It has filters that can be replaced, that can be cleaned, that can be used. So the reality is, what we have is not sufficient. It is not enough. But we had to fight with the city just to end visits to stop the outside from coming in. But Laura, who would think that you can solve a public health problem by putting people back in the streets?INGRAHAM: Elias, this is happening not just in Rikers Island, though. There is a push to use the coronavirus to not make arrests, basically decriminalize criminal activity because it is just too much and it's too much stress on the system. There is a push to not deport criminal aliens in the United States in some quarters. Activist groups say no, we have to stop all deportations and all of our people should just be focused on the coronavirus.HUSAMUDEEN: Currently, there is no need to. The inmate population in New York City is lower than it has been in decades. We have approximately about 5,400 inmates in our custody.

The researchers showed that none of the past fluctuations \u2014 that is, not the Little Ice Age, the warm period known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly or any other famous shift \u2014 had the global reach that modern climate change is having. Past fluctuations tended to be localized, affecting primarily one region at a time. Modern climate change, by contrast, is messing with the entire world.\"Temperatures did not rise and fall everywhere in step [in the past],\" editors wrote in an accompanying opinion piece in Nature Geoscience. \"Specifically, early cool or warm intervals that lasted for centuries peaked at different times in different regions.\"That's a radical departure from modern climate change, Scott St. George, a climate researcher at the University of Minnesota who wasn't involved in the research, wrote in a\u00a0\u00a0for Nature. []\"Although the Little Ice Age was the coldest epoch of the past millennium, the timing of the lowest temperatures varied from place to place,\" St. George wrote. \"Two-fifths of the planet were subjected to the coldest weather during the mid-nineteenth century, but the deepest chill occurred several centuries earlier in other regions. And even at the height of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, only 40% of Earth\"s surface reached peak temperatures at the same time. Using the same metrics, global warming today is unparalleled: for 98% of the planet's surface, the warmest period of the Common Era occurred in the late twentieth century.\"That means that almost every part of the planet had its hottest decades in the past 2,000 years at the same time.And the 21st century, which is outside the scope of these papers, has been\u00a0\u00a0so far. In fact, the world is on track to\u00a0\u00a0as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere.To develop a rigorous picture of global temperatures over the past 2,000 years, the researchers relied on nearly 700 records from the so-called PAGES 2k proxy temperature database. That database rounds up evidence from ice cores, trees, coral and other substances that change their appearance or chemical composition based on global temperatures. The researchers used those records to build a detailed map of climate fluctuations the world over. And none of them look like the consistent, persistent shifts we're seeing today.Of course, the causes are different, too. Evidence from the previous 2,000 years shows that short-lived volcanic events were the main drivers of climate fluctuations, the authors wrote. Human activities were perhaps a very minor secondary factor over that period. Now, humans are the ones driving the bus.

{"id": null, "body": "Is it just freakish weather or something more? Climate scientists suggest that if you want a glimpse of some of the worst of global warming, take a look at U.S. weather in recent weeks.Horrendous wildfires. Oppressive heat waves. Devastating droughts. Flooding from giant deluges. And a powerful freak wind storm called a derecho.These are the kinds of extremes experts have predicted will come with climate change, although it's far too early to say that is the cause. Nor will they say global warming is the reason 3,215 daily high temperature records were set in the month of June.Scientifically linking individual weather events to climate change takes intensive study, complicated mathematics, computer models and lots of time. Sometimes it isn't caused by global warming. Weather is always variable; freak things happen.And this weather has been local. Europe, Asia and Africa aren't having similar disasters now, although they've had their own extreme events in recent years.But since at least 1988, climate scientists have warned that climate change would bring, in general, increased heat waves, more droughts, more sudden downpours, more widespread wildfires and worsening storms. In the United States, those extremes are happening here and now.So far this year, more than 2.1 million acres have burned in wildfires, more than 113 million people in the U.S. were in areas under extreme heat advisories last Friday, two-thirds of the country is experiencing drought, and earlier in June, deluges flooded Minnesota and Florida.\"This is what global warming looks like at the regional or personal level,\" said Jonathan Overpeck, professor of geosciences and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona. \"The extra heat increases the odds of worse heat waves, droughts, storms and wildfire. This is certainly what I and many other climate scientists have been warning about.\"Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in fire-charred Colorado, said these are the very record-breaking conditions he has said would happen, but many people wouldn't listen. So it's I told-you-so time, he said.As recently as March, a special report an extreme events and disasters by the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of \"unprecedented extreme weather and climate events.\" Its lead author, Chris Field of the Carnegie Institution and Stanford University, said Monday, \"It's really dramatic how many of the patterns that we've talked about as the expression of the extremes are hitting the U.S. right now.\"\"What we're seeing really is a window into what global warming really looks like,\" said Princeton University geosciences and international affairs professor Michael Oppenheimer. \"It looks like heat. It looks like fires. It looks like this kind of environmental disasters.\"Oppenheimer said that on Thursday. That was before the East Coast was hit with triple-digit temperatures and before a derecho \u2014 a large, powerful and long-lasting straight-line wind storm \u2014 blew from Chicago to Washington. The storm and its aftermath killed more than 20 people and left millions without electricity. Experts say it had energy readings five times that of normal thunderstorms.Fueled by the record high heat, this was among the strongest of this type of storm in the region in recent history, said research meteorologist Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storm Laboratory in Norman, Okla. Scientists expect \"non-tornadic wind events\" like this one and other thunderstorms to increase with climate change because of the heat and instability, he said.Such patterns haven't happened only in the past week or two. The spring and winter in the U.S. were the warmest on record and among the least snowy, setting the stage for the weather extremes to come, scientists say.Since Jan. 1, the United States has set more than 40,000 hot temperature records, but fewer than 6,000 cold temperature records, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Through most of last century, the U.S. used to set cold and hot records evenly, but in the first decade of this century America set two hot records for every cold one, said Jerry Meehl, a climate extreme expert at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. This year the ratio is about 7 hot to 1 cold. Some computer models say that ratio will hit 20-to-1 by midcentury, Meehl said.\"In the future you would expect larger, longer more intense heat waves and we've seen that in the last few summers,\" NOAA Climate Monitoring chief Derek Arndt said.The 100-degree heat, drought, early snowpack melt and beetles waking from hibernation early to strip trees all combined to set the stage for the current unusual spread of wildfires in the West, said University of Montana ecosystems professor Steven Running, an expert on wildfires.While at least 15 climate scientists told The Associated Press that this long hot U.S. summer is consistent with what is to be expected in global warming, history is full of such extremes, said John Christy at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. He's a global warming skeptic who says, \"The guilty party in my view is Mother Nature.\"But the vast majority of mainstream climate scientists, such as Meehl, disagree: \"This is what global warming is like, and we'll see more of this as we go into the future.\"___Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on extreme weather: http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/U.S. weather records:http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/records/ ___Seth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears", "headline": "This summer is 'what global warming looks like'", "article_name": "this-summer-is-what-global-warming-looks-like", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/this-summer-is-what-global-warming-looks-like", "date_published": "2015-11-29 00:00:00", "article_length": 5600, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:39.487113"}

For more than two years President Trump has talked about pulling the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Starting Monday, he can finally do something about it. But the withdrawal process will take a year and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t become official until the day after the 2020 presidential election.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For more than two years President Donald Trump\u00a0\u00a0out of the landmark Paris\u00a0\u00a0. Starting Monday he finally can do something about it.Even then, though, the withdrawal process takes a year and wouldn't become official until at least the day after the 2020 presidential election.In the Paris agreement, nearly 200 countries set their own national targets for reducing or controlling pollution of heat-trapping gases. It was negotiated in 2015 with lots of prodding by the United States and China and\u00a0\u00a0Nov. 4, 2016.The terms of the deal say no country can withdraw in the first three years. So Monday is the first time the U.S. could actually start the withdrawal process, which begins with a letter to the United Nations. And it doesn't become official for a year after that, which leads to the day after the election.If someone other than Trump wins in 2020, the next president could get back in the deal in just 30 days and plan to cut carbon pollution, said Andrew Light, a former Obama State Department climate negotiator now at the nonprofit World Resources Institute.Light and other experts say the withdrawal by the United States, the second biggest climate polluter and world's largest economy, will hurt efforts to fight global warming.\"Global objectives can't be met unless everybody does their part and the U.S. has to play the game,\" said Appalachian State University environmental sciences professor Gregg Marland, who is part of a global effort to track carbon dioxide emissions. \"We're the second biggest player. What happens to the game if we take our ball and go home?\"Someone else, probably the biggest polluter China, will take over leadership in the global fight, said MIT economist Jake Jacoby, who co-founded the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.The penalty for the U.S. \"is not in economic loss. The penalty is in shame, in discrediting U.S. leadership,\" Jacoby said.Asked what the U.S. plans next, State Department spokesman James Dewey on Friday emailed only this: \"The U.S. position with respect to the Paris Agreement has not changed. The United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.\"The agreement set goals of preventing another 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius) to 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) of warming from current levels. Even the pledges made in 2015 weren't enough to prevent those levels of warming.The deal calls for nations to come up with more ambitious pollution cuts every five years, starting in November 2020 in at a meeting in Scotland. Because of the expected withdrawal, the U.S. role in 2020 negotiations will be reduced, Light said.Climate change, caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas,\u00a0\u00a0by 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) since the late 1800s, caused massive melting of ice globally, triggered weather extremes and changed ocean chemistry. And scientists say, depending on how much carbon dioxide is emitted, it will only get worse by the end of the century with\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0by close to three feet (1 meter).Trump has been promising to pull out of the Paris deal since 2017, often mischaracterizing the terms of the agreement, which are voluntary. In October, he called it a massive wealth transfer from America to other nations and said it was one-sidedThat's not the case, experts said.For example, the U.S. goal \u2014 set by Barack Obama's administration \u2014 had been to reduce carbon dioxide emission in 2025 by 26% to 28% compared to 2005 levels. This translates to about 15% compared to 1990 levels.The European Union's goal was to cut carbon pollution in 2030 by 40% compared to 1990 levels, which is greater than America's pledge, said Stanford University's Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that track carbon emissions worldwide. The United Kingdom has already exceeded that goal, he said.\"The U.S. agreement is not a tax on the American people. There is no massive wealth transfer,\" said Climate Advisers CEO Nigel Purvis, who was a lead State Department climate negotiator in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. \"In fact, the agreement obligates no country to make any financial payments.\"Formally getting out of the Paris agreement is bad, but at this point after years of rhetoric is more symbolic than anything, said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb. She said she is more worried about other Trump carbon pollution actions, such as fighting California's tougher emissions and mileage standards and rollbacks of coal fired power plant regulations.The U.S. was not on track to reach its Paris pledge, according to the federal Energy Information Administration's latest projections.The EIA projects that in 2025 emissions will be at 4959 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, 17% below 2005 levels, about 500 million tons short of the goal. Emissions in 2018 were nearly 2% higher than in 2016, the agency's\u00a0\u00a0says. That spike likely was from extreme weather and economic growth, Marland and Jacoby said.", "headline": "Trump can begin steps to pull US out of Paris climate deal", "article_name": "trump-can-begin-steps-to-pull-us-out-of-paris-climate-deal", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/trump-can-begin-steps-to-pull-us-out-of-paris-climate-deal", "date_published": "2019-11-04 00:00:00", "article_length": 5628, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:40.094315"}

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comNearly 42,000 years ago, massive animals such as 6-foot-tall birds, 23-foot long lizards\u00a0and wombat-like creatures the size of a Buick could be seen roaming the countryside. But a new study has found that these megafaunas became extinct because of human intervention and .The researchers, led by Dr. Frederik Saltre of Flinders University, used\u00a0a variety of techniques to find human migration patterns in Australia.\u201cWe developed a complex mathematical technique to solve the problems of averaging timelines over landscapes,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cOur approach extends the information provided by radiocarbon-dated fossils from the extinct species themselves, and archaeological evidence from early Aboriginal people, [and] this way we can create unbiased maps of both the timings of megafauna extinctions and human arrival across the landscape.\u201d\n      The Pleistocene kangaroo Procoptodon goliah the most extreme of the short-faced kangaroos, was the largest and most heavily built kangaroo known. It had an unusually short, flat face and forwardly directed eyes, with a single large toe on each foot (reduced from the more normal count of four). Each hand had two long, clawed fingers that would have been used to bring leafy branches within reach. (Credit: Centre of Excellence for Australia Biodiversity and Heritage.)\n      Based on these new maps, the team of researchers was able to estimate the regions where humans and megafauna coexisted (for example, New South Wales and north of South Australia), and where they did not (south of Victoria, Tasmania, etc.).\u201cWe then used sophisticated spatial computer models to analyze what conditions \u2013 changing temperature, precipitation, freshwater availability, proportion of desert, plant coverage, and the arrival of people \u2013 best explained the timing of megafauna extinctions across the landscape,\u201d Saltre added.With most of Australia being arid, freshwater was a high priority for megafauna and humans, with its availability being one of the main reasons for people\u2019s migration patterns. Humans and megafauna would inevitably interact at watering holes, leaving the giant animals vulnerable to hunting, further dwindling their numbers.\n      (Credit: Centre of Excellence for Australia Biodiversity and Heritage.)\n      In other areas where humans weren\u2019t around to hunt the creatures or use up their resources, the megafauna eventually succumbed to the increasingly dry climate, which killed off the vegetation. According to Saltre, unlike today, these ancient humans did not have an impact on the big dry-out.\u201cIn regions like Tasmania and south of South Australia and Victoria, humans never coexisted with megafauna because they migrated across these areas after the megafauna had already gone extinct,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis rules humans out as the likely driver of megafauna extinction in those regions only, but a closer look at climate change during this extinction event in these areas showed that megafauna species might have suffered from a lack of food availability in the form of plants \u2014 most of the species that went extinct were plant-eaters.\u201dSo why was the role of humans in the demise of the Australian megafauna so heavily debated over the years? According to Saltre, up until now, the main ways researchers looked into the causes of megafauna extinction were\u00a0to build timelines of major events:\u00a0when the species went extinct;\u00a0when people arrived;\u00a0and when the climate changed.However, because there are so few fossilized animal specimens in Australia due to the continent\u2019s harsh conditions, reliable data is scarce. Some studies have been restricted to making conclusions at the scale of single paleontological sites, or of specific archaeological sites, while other studies have taken the opposite approach by including evidence from across the entire continent.\u201cUnfortunately, this \u2018lumping\u2019 of the available evidence across many different sites ignores the fact that different conditions might be causing extinctions in different combinations depending on where you are in the landscape,\u201d Saltre said.\n      (Credit: Centre of Excellence for Australia Biodiversity and Heritage)\n      He continued: \u201cThis is like either having too few pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to be able to see the big picture (single sites), or being able to see the big picture, but only a fuzzy, pixelated version of it (landscape averaging). Our new approach takes the best of both worlds, because we have now access to all the pieces of the puzzle to unveil the big picture at a good resolution.\u201dThe study can be found in .", "headline": "Massive animals in Australia died from humans and climate change, study says", "article_name": "massive-animals-australia-died-humans-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/massive-animals-australia-died-humans-climate-change", "date_published": "2019-12-06 00:00:00", "article_length": 4655, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:43.038198"}

Scientists say salamanders in the mountain range are getting smaller in response to climate change. I got my first lesson on the subject of climate change more than 10 years ago. My tutor was an internationally famous climate scientist at a major Ivy League university. Unlike most lectures I have heard from professors, this one was brief, to the point and extremely enlightening.At the time I was a columnist for the New York Daily News, recently arrived in the United States after more than 30 years in Israel. I had heard about global warming, of course, but I hadn\u2019t thought much about it. Israel has other, more pressing issues.[pullquote]In May 2001, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its third report, which got a lot of media attention. I looked through it and realized immediately that I had no chance of understanding the science.I was in good company \u2013 I doubt there are half a dozen journalists in captivity who can actually understand the mathematical and chemical formulas and computer projections. That\u2019s what press releases are for.One item got my attention. It said: \u201cProjections based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios suggest warming over the 21st Century at a more rapid rate than that experienced for at least the last 10,000 years.\u201dI called the professor, one of the authors of the report, for a clarification (he remains nameless because we were off the record). \u201cIf global warming is caused by man-made emissions,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhat accounts for the world warming to this same level 10,000 years ago?\u201dThere was a long silence. Then the professor said, \u201cAre you serious?\u201dI admitted that I was.The professor loudly informed me that my question was stupid. The panel\u2019s conclusion was indisputable science, arrived at after years of research by a conclave of the world\u2019s leading climate scholars. Who was I to dispute it?I told him I wasn\u2019t disputing it, just trying to understand how, you know, the world could have been this hot before without the help of human agency. Maybe this is just a natural climate change like ice ages that once connected continents and warming periods that caused them to drift apart or \u2026At which point I heard a click. The professor hung up on me. At that exact moment I became a climate skeptic. I may not know anything about science, but I have learned over a long career that when an expert hangs up in the middle of a question, it means that he doesn\u2019t know the answer.This isn\u2019t shocking. Experts, even on subjects less complicated than what the world\u2019s temperature will be in 200 years, are often wrong. One tip-off is when they argue by assuring you that everybody smart already knows they are right.I was reminded of this encounter the other day while reading a Time Magazine cover story titled, \u201cEat Butter: Scientists labeled fat the enemy. Why they were wrong.\u201d The article chronicled the decades-long consensus, backed by official U.S. government policy as well as a militant (and self-interested) scientific establishment, that fat was a killer. According to Time, this was \u201cso embedded in modern medicine and nutrition that it became nearly impossible to challenge the consensus.\u201d Scientific journals refused to publish data challenging this orthodoxy. People who did, like Dr. Robert Atkins, were derided as quacks.Now that consensus has flipped (Time Magazine doesn\u2019t publish articles outside any current consensus). It may flip again someday as we learn even more about nutrition and health. But for now, the danger of eating fat \u2013 once an unshakable tenet of settled science \u2013 is out of intellectual fashion. People who have virtuously deprived themselves of t-bones, ice cream and cheesecake are now left with egg on their faces. It is a reminder that bad science, backed by a politicized posse of experts, can have distasteful consequences.Another recent article, this one in the New York Times, also caught my eye. It reported that a submerged forest in Wales has suddenly re-emerged, revealing traces that humans had lived there before the sea rose after the last ice age. \u201cAbout 10,000 years ago, temperatures warmed sharply, by eight to ten degrees Fahrenheit,\u201d said Dr. Martin Bates, a geoarcheologist called in to examine the situation. The footprints found in the sediment belonged to \u201crefugees of prehistoric climate change,\u201d he said (happily, Wales has since been repopulated).Dr. Nicholas Ashton of the British Museum, a participant in the project, was philosophical. \u201cWe can reconstruct the climate and climate change nearly one million years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big lesson is, we have to adapt. Whether we like it or not the climate will change \u2013 it always has.\u201d He quickly added that human beings were now \u201caccelerating that change.\u201d The Times reporter didn\u2019t ask him how much the change was accelerating, or what, besides people, might be causing an eons-old phenomenon. Perhaps she didn\u2019t wonder. Or maybe she didn\u2019t feel like getting hung up on by an expert.", "headline": "Climate change: The moment I became a climate skeptic", "article_name": "climate-change-the-moment-i-became-a-climate-skeptic", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-the-moment-i-became-a-climate-skeptic", "date_published": "2015-05-07 00:00:00", "article_length": 5209, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:43.682691"}

The dreaded scenario, which predicts a total sea level rise of 23.6 inches (60 cm) by the year 2100, would put hundreds of millions of people living in coastal communities at risk of losing their homes \u2014 or their lives \u2014 to flooding.\"Every centimeter of sea level rise leads to coastal flooding and coastal erosion, disrupting people's lives around the planet,\" study author Andrew Shepherd, a professor of Earth Observation at the University of Leeds in England,\u00a0. \"If Antarctica and Greenland continue to track the worst-case climate warming scenario, they will cause an extra 6.7 inches (17 cm) of sea level rise by the end of the century.\"\"This would mean 400 million people are at risk of annual coastal flooding by 2100,\" Shepherd added.For the new studies, a team of 89 scientists assessed ice loss data from 11 satellites that have been monitoring Antarctica and Greenland since the early 1990s. The data created a detailed picture of how much mass each region's glaciers have lost over the last 30 years, and showed how quickly the remaining ice is flowing into the sea.The team found that Greenland and Antarctica have lost a combined 7 trillion tons of ice (6.4 trillion metric tons) from 1992 to 2017. Almost all of the lost ice in Antarctica and about half of the lost ice in Greenland is due to warming ocean waters melting the edges of glaciers, causing each region's ice sheets to flow more quickly toward the sea. The rest of Greenland's ice loss is due to warming air temperatures, which melt the ice sheets at their surfaces, the researchers said.The rate of ice loss in each ice sheet also increased substantially over that period, rising from a combined 89 billion tons (81 billion metric tons) per year in the 1990s to 523 billion tons (475 billion metric tons) per year in the 2010s.This sixfold increase in the rate of ice loss means that the melting polar ice sheets are responsible for a third of all sea level rise, the researchers said.

It is Abraham and Nuccitelli who mislead the public by misrepresenting what the climate debate is about.Abraham and Nuccitelli site , a study co-authored by Nuccitelli, which allegedly finds that 97% of climate scientists agree with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that most of the 0.7\u00b0C of global warming since 1951 is due to man-made greenhouse gases. Skeptics, they suggest, are a fringe element, unworthy of media attention.But the Cook study does not really prove what it claims to prove.The authors examined 11,944 abstracts of climate papers published between 1991-2011. They found that nearly two-thirds of the abstracts expressed no opinion on the supposed \u201cconsensus\u201d position. So their headline \u2013 97% of scientists agree \u2013 is inaccurate and misleading. IN 1984-speak, they are claiming Silence is Affirmation. Of the abstracts that expressed an opinion, Cook et al. claim that 97.1% (less than one-third of the original total) agree with the IPCC consensus position. But that too is a stretcher.University of Delaware Prof.  and three colleagues examined the Cook team\u2019s , and found that less than 1% of the 11,944 abstracts explicitly endorse the so-called consensus.Is the 97% figure made up out of whole cloth? Not quite. It turns out that 97% of about one-third of the abstracts affirms or implies that humans are responsible for  portion of global warming since 1951.And guess what? Just about every prominent skeptic \u00a0agrees with that as well. As an attempt to discredit contrarians, the Cook study is a bust.The key science question for climate researchers today is not whether greenhouse gas emissions warm the planet but whether state-of-the-art computer models are accurate enough to forecast climate change and inform policy decisions. As it turns out, the IPCC\u2019s latest ensemble of climate models produce estimates that overshoot the warming of the .Skeptics have been pointing out the growing mismatch between models and observations for years. But if not for contrarian blogs like Watts Up With That and conservative outlets like Fox News, how would the general public ever know?The key science question for citizens and their representatives is not whether most recent warming is man-made but whether climate change, as Al Gore HAS put it, is a \u201cplanetary emergency . . . that threatens the survival of civilization and the habitability of the Earth.\u201d As , the latest IPCC report \u2013 the Bible of consensus climatology \u2013 implicitly disavows Gore\u2019s doomsday scenarios.Finally, the key issue for policymakers is not whether climate change poses risks but whether the proposed \u201csolutions\u201d \u2013 carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, and other schemes to rig the market against plentiful, affordable, reliable fossil fuels \u2013 would do more harm than good.Many scientists think green pressure groups and the IPCC exaggerate the perils of climate change, and many experts regard cap-and-trade and the like as a cure worse than the alleged disease. Thus, contrary to Abraham and Nuccitelli, the \u201cdivision amongst climate experts\u201d is real and substantial.Perhaps Abraham and Nuccitelli are frustrated by the inability of 20 years of climate treaty negotiations to slow the growth in global carbon dioxide emissions. But that failure is due to economic and technological realities, not faulty \u201cperceptions\u201d of climatology.For decades the climate alarm movement has been pushing \u201csolutions\u201d that would handicap fossil fuels rather than make alternative energy more competitive \u2013 that is, cheaper without costly subsidies. With global energy demand rapidly increasing, especially in developing countries where millions still live in poverty, the green agenda has been a dead end from day one.What amazes is that Abraham and Nuccitelli still pin their hopes on the cult of consensus. Forging an inter-governmental consensus has been the IPCC\u2019s mission for 25 years, unavoidably politicizing climate science in the process. It has long since begun to backfire. People get suspicious when government-appointed experts define \u201cthe science\u201d for the purpose of advancing an agenda that just happens to increase government control of energy markets.Abraham and Nuccitelli have learned nothing if they think that demanding even greater fealty to groupthink will do anything except energize skeptics and increase their popularity.The good news is that conservative media are not going to take their advice, because doing so would allow one faction of experts to monopolize the discussion. Scores of government agencies, hundreds of mainstream media outlets, and thousands of Web sites serve up daily diets of climate alarm.

It is also the biggest producer of dairy and wine. Prone to drought, the state has implemented a  limiting farmers\u2019 access to water.\u00a0While the move to Tennessee saved the family from bankruptcy, the Nashes are concerned with some rhetoric and proposed legislation coming from Washington, D.C., surrounding .\u00a0\"They\u2019re making all these bills and regulations, and people living in the city actually believe it instead of believing in your farmers that are actually putting food on the table for you,\" said Stephanie, who is also a singer-songwriter and agricultural activist.She hopes her advocacy, the Nash Creamery and their new cheese plant will be enough to keep the family business afloat.\u00a0\"That's what everybody prays for,\" Stephanie told Fox News. \"We pray for rain, we pray for fair prices and we pray for regulations that are not going to kill off our industry.\"Steven\u2019s grandfather, Wallace Nash, began milking cows in central California in 1929. A decade later, Steven\u2019s father, Howard, took over the farm and grew the operation from 30 to 200 cows.\u00a0In 1980, Howardbecame ill, and 20-year-old Steven stepped in and took over the farm's daily operations. Over the next 40 years, the herd expanded from 200 to over 1,200 cows.\u00a0\"Dairy\u2019s just something I\u2019ve always liked,\" Steven told Fox News. \"I really enjoy seeing a well-bred cow \u2026 that walks fluidly, has a nice udder and produces lots of milk. That\u2019s my gratification.\"\u00a0The Nashes milk their cows twice a day, grow their own feed and recently opened a creamery and a cheese plant to help supplement costs.\u00a0In February, the USDA forecast the 2020 median farm household income at a loss of $1,840. On average, nearly 90% of a family farm's income is supplied by another source of income or employment.Small dairy farms are among the least sustainable type of farm today as they grapple with declining demand for cow's milk and consolidation in their industry, resulting in much larger but fewer farms, according to the USDA. Since 2003, the U.S. has lost more than half of its licensed dairy operations, down to under 32,000 operations.\"The last farm bill, the dairy policy was put together without a lot of input from farmers,\" Steven said of the 2018 Agricultural Improvement Act.\u00a0\"They changed our pricing mechanism, and what that\u2019s done is taken nearly a billion dollars out of the dairy industry, out of the farming sector, out of my segment, and moved it to processors and other people in the industry before it gets to the grocery store,\" he continued.\u00a0At the urging of dairy processors, the 2018 farm bill changed an industry formula that determines the price of fluid milk under the Federal Milk Marketing Order system.\u00a0\"The change contributed to substantial market volatility last year and has led to an estimated $750 million in losses for farmers compared to the previous Class I formula,\" the National Milk Producers Federation said in an October statement. \"Without a fix, dairy farmers will permanently bear unfair and unnecessary price risk compared to processors during times of unusual market volatility.\"Steven told Fox News: \"It's a lot of money to lose. That has been very difficult for a lot of people, myself included.\"As a result of this formula change, price increases in grocery stores doesn't mean the farmer sees an increase on their end. Additionally, farmers face  on gas and energy, labor shortages, high feed expenses and supply chain issues.\"We are a capital-intensive business,\" Steven said. \"We live and die on feed costs.\"He said those account for 55% of the farm\u2019s expenses.\u00a0\"We\u2019re not like other businesses where we can just cut back,\" he said. \"Cows got to be fed every day, right?\"He added that the labor shortage and supply chain delays were also critical issues.\"We're time sensitive,\" he said. \"We can miss our window of opportunity just because of a bearing or a tire.\"The National Milk Producers Federation estimated that shipping disruptions cost the U.S. dairy industry nearly $1 billion during the first half of the year from higher shipping and inventory costs, lost export volume and price deterioration.Stephanie often posts on TikTok and YouTube to voice her concerns for struggling farmers and to educate people on how some legislative bills affect the agriculture industry.\n      Nash Family Creamery\n      \"You look at big seed companies, you look at the ethanol plants, you look at all these big investors, again, going back to politicians, what are they investing in?\" she said. \"Why are they putting all this funding into certain areas? Because they're going to make more money.\"\"The farmer is going to be dead, and the family farms are going to be gone, and they're going to continue to get richer off of stuff like plant-based and climate change,\" Stephanie continued.\u00a0Stephanie often warns her followers about policy threats to the agriculture industry, like President Biden\u2019s  a federal push to conserve 30% of the nation's lands and waters by 2030.\u00a0Similarly, the departments of the Interior, Agriculture and Commerce alongside the White House Council on Environmental Quality released\u00a0, a preliminary report regarding conservation. It states that \"federal agencies can and should advance conservation by supporting programs that incentivize voluntary conservation efforts and provide new sources of income for American farmers, ranchers, and forest stewards.\"Stephanie told Fox News: \"There's a lot of money in Washington, D.C., and I'm really scared that money is going towards persuading people in the USDA to go plant-based, to go climate change, to fund all of this other stuff \u2026 so corporate and big- investor farm systems continue to farm and gain access to our pricing in the grocery store.\"Steven, who hopes to pass on the farm to his daughter one day, said Nash Farms received aid from the federal government to help with coronavirus-related issues.\u00a0\"While we use them, we don\u2019t like them,\" he said of the farmers aid programs. \"I want a fair price that represents the work that we do.\"\"We have a great product.,\" Steven continued. \"Why does the government got to support us because we can't make it on our own? That's that's the fundamental issue here.\"Dairy farmers have received more than $3 billion, or about $1 of every $8, of the $24.4 billion disbursed to farmers and ranchers since COVID-19 payments began in May 2020, according to the USDA.\"We are in a place that we could go either way,\" Steven said of his farm\u2019s financial stability. \"I've been there many times before, so we'll just have to see what the next few months bring.\"Teny Sahakian is an Associate Producer/Writer for Fox News.

Here are five questions reporters should ask to test whether the candidates\u2019 climate policies deserve the support of the American people. In fact, these are questions that should be asked of all politicians who advocate climate policies, regardless of their party affiliation.With 10-year Treasury bond yields continuing to fall relative to two-year bond yields, and 30-year bond yields hitting an all-time low, many market analysts worry the  is heading towards a recession.However, a recent Bloomberg News article notes that  in August hit an all-time high, and a major reason is low oil prices. As the story explains: \u201cFew things get consumers to pull back like rising gasoline prices.\u201dIndeed, \u201cevery downturn since 1970 has been preceded by a doubling of oil prices the prior 12 months that has pressured consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy.\u201dOil prices are low because the U.S. energy companies are producing at . Climate policies such as the Green New Deal aim to ban offshore drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and fossil fuel exports and imports, plus \u201cmassively raise taxes\u201d on oil industry investors.Such policies would quickly bankrupt industries that keep consumer confidence high by keeping energy prices low.   find that the Green New Deal would impose massive costs on U.S. households. For example, a Competitive Enterprise Institute/Power the Future  estimates that Green New Deal energy policies would cost an average household in Pennsylvania $72,000 in the first year of the program, $45,000 annually in the second through fifth years, and $38,000 in year six and later.Assuming mainstream climate science modeling, eliminating all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow would avert only . Such a tiny change, which is  to be reliably detected, would have no discernible effect on weather patterns, crop yields, or polar bear populations.The recent National Climate Assessment   when it claimed global warming could reach 8\u00b0C (14\u00b0F) and lop 10 percent off U.S. GDP by century\u2019s end. However, to get that alarming result, the assessment ran an  that on average project  as actually occurred.Worse, the modelers used an inflated  in which coal scales up rapidly to provide nearly half of all global energy by 2100 \u2013 a percentage .Even with that biased combo, warming hits 8\u00b0C in only  of model projections \u2013 a detail the assessment failed to mention.In the United States, there has been  in any region since the 1920s, and no nationwide increase in drought since 1900 as measured by the .There has been  since 1900 in the strength or frequency of U.S. land-falling hurricanes, and none in hurricane-related damages once losses are adjusted for increases in population, wealth, and the consumer price index.Globally, the total area burned by wildfires has , and  that the number of square kilometers burned fell by about 25 percent between 2003 and 2019.In addition, all major indicators of human health and well-being such as , , and  have improved dramatically during the era of global warming.Finally, whatever effects global warming may be having on the weather since the 1920s, the individual risk of dying from extreme weather globally has decreased by 99 percent, and since 1990, the relative economic impact of extreme weather (measured as a percent of global GDP) .Politicians proposing multitrillion-dollar climate plans owe it to the American people to answer tough questions, rather than relying on claims of \u201cconsensus\u201d and smearing those who disagree in an attempt to dodge them.", "headline": "Marlo Lewis: Climate questions for politicians (that no one seems to want to ask)", "article_name": "marlo-lewis-climate-questions-for-democrats-that-no-one-seems-to-want-to-ask", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/marlo-lewis-climate-questions-for-democrats-that-no-one-seems-to-want-to-ask", "date_published": "2019-09-04 00:00:00", "article_length": 3725, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:47.515905"}

But our next guest disagrees. John Coleman is the co- founder of the Weather Channel, winner of the American Meteorological -- that's a tough one -- Meteorological Society's award for broadcast meteorologist of the year and he has spent more than 60 years reporting on the weather.John, good to see you tonight. And so upset were you about the claims of manmade global warming that you wrote a letter to the UCLA's Hammer Museum form their forum that was called Tackling Climate Change. And you said, \"You don't have both sides represented, and I'm here to tell you that manmade global climate change is a myth.\" How can you say that?JOHN COLEMAN, WEATHER CHANNEL CO-FOUNDER: Well, it's very easy. But thank you for having me on your program. You know, a climate skeptic can rarely get on TV, ever since Al Gore made it a plank of the Democratic Party.KELLY: And they say you're a \"Looney Tunes\" if you don't believe it.COLEMAN: You bet, and I been in the TV news organizations now for 60 years, and I only met two Republicans the whole time, and they were both hiding in the closet.(LAUGHTER)This is a tough go for people who don't believe in climate change. A lot study on this.KELLY: Well, we heard a lot of that from the last even presidential debate. I mean, even some of the Republican candidates up there, suggested you are nuts. Remember Jon Huntsman? If you don't believe in manmade global climate change.COLEMAN: Well, it's very difficult for anybody to be against it because the media has told the nation over and over again, day after day for 20 years that the oceans are rising, the polar bears are dying, the sea -- the ice is melting, the storms are going to sweep the earth and that we're all gonna die of a heat wave. I mean, this is an incredible bad, bad science.KELLY: What's your data to the contrary?COLEMAN: A professor at UCLA in James Engstrom was very upset that the Hammer Museum forum was going to not give both sides of the climate debate. So he suggested they should have Willie Soon from Harvard and me, join that debate, of course we were turned down. I wrote a nice memo to the people at the Hammer Museum and that got picked up by my friends at the Heartland Institute, the think tank in Chicago. They put out a press release and voila, it's been all over the media -- not the mainstream media of course, the Internet and the --KELLY: But what's your data to the contrary? And soon the Weather Channel will be canceled all together -- they will push it out of existence since you've taken this position. But let's get specific. You talk about how the efforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and that it's causing significant warming have failed. And yet the data say that carbon dioxide was proven to be a greenhouse gas in the 1957 paper by Roger Ravel. The EPA says it's a greenhouse gas, the scientific community has accepted that it is a greenhouse gas and at the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has gone up since 1958.COLEMAN: Well, there are 9,000 PhDs and 31 scientists who have signed the petition that says it's not a significant greenhouse gas. Oh, it's a teen itsy bitsy but in greenhouse gas but it's not in any ways significant. And we are sure of it. It's not like, something I made up or just thought of. I've studied and studied and studied.And Roger Revelle, the great scientist who wrote that paper back in 1957 with Hans Suess changed his mind a decade later and said, \"Wait a minute, I think we were wrong. Don't anybody panic. I don't think there's any global warming.\" And that's when Al Gore said he was senile --(CROSSTALK)KELLY: Al Gore. OK. Al Gore said he was senile. Speaking of Al Gore, let's remind the audience on what Al Gore said.COLEMAN: Al Gore had one class in science. Roger Revelle taught it to him. He got a D and yet he's made a billion dollars off to climate change. Shame on you Al Gore.KELLY: Standby. I want to play Al Gore. This is his argument and then you can respond. Listen to him.(BEGIN VIDOE CLIP, \"AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH\")AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: Starting in 1970 there was a precipitous drop-off in the amount and extent and thickness of the arctic icecap. It has diminished by 40 percent in 40 years. And there are now two major studies showing that within the next 50 to 70 years in summertime it will be completely gone.(END OF VIDEO CLIP)KELLY: Your thoughts on that.COLEMAN: Well, I would like to announce tonight, to people who are friends of Al Gore's that, \"Whoops, he got that one wrong!\" The Antarctic icecap is at all-time record high in both coverage and thickness. And the Arctic icecap at the North Pole is at the highest it has been in several years. It's in its so-called normal range since we got satellite observations that could measure it.So, not only is the ice not melting, more polar bears are alive and happy today than we've had in 100 years.Life is good, Ms. Kelly, I got to tell you, life is good.KELLY: John Coleman, good to see you, thanks for being here, sir.

{"id": null, "body": "Cal Thomas on whether news outlets are reporting the facts on global warmingThe inconvenient truth President Obama denies about climate change is that\u00a0China\u2019s refusal to cooperate in international efforts to address the problem makes U.S. efforts to slow its pace futile. Moreover, his policies severely handicap America\u2019s ability to mitigate its consequences.The global climate has gone through profound cycles of cooling and warming since long before humans walked the Earth.\u00a0While public figures and some scientists may disagree, the majority of researchers have concluded that human activities \u2013 in particular, greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 are now a significant cause of global warming, and they are urging concerted international action.Carbon dioxide\u00a0composes 80 percent of harmful emissions. Having failed to win congressional approval for a system of permits to reduce emissions, the president has unilaterally targeted coal-fired electric utilities and fuel used in transportation to reduce U.S. emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels.Those actions are unnecessary and harmful.[pullquote]In recent years, more abundant and cheaper natural gas has motivated electric utilities to switch from coal, and energy intensive manufacturers in metals, chemicals and the like have made remarkable, cost-saving progress to reduce energy use.Responding to consumer preferences, automakers were making more fuel-efficient vehicles before the president imposed more stringent mileage standards. The high cost and stress of commuting are encouraging many young people to live closer to their jobs. Competition from rail is pressuring trucking companies to purchase more fuel-efficient rigs.Together, those free-market decisions have reduced CO2 emissions by more than 9 percent from 2005 levels.Now the EPA and other federal agencies want to micro-manage those choices by imposing inflexible standards on electric utilities and other manufacturers. Progressives would happily force as many Americans as they can onto mass transit, imposing a terrible drain on state transportation and local government operating budgets.Those initiatives would not do much to arrest global warming, but by increasing taxes and production costs, they would send more jobs to China.With an economy about half the size, China already emits almost twice as much CO2 as either the United States or Europe. Every 18 months, its emissions grow enough to replace the emissions savings the United States will accomplish by hitting the president\u2019s 15-year target.Other developing countries, like India, are similarly adding to the problem; however, China accounts for about 85 percent of the annual increase in global CO2 emissions.When jobs are outsourced to China, global emissions go up, because China uses energy less efficiently and relies more\u00a0\u00a0than the United States, and the growth of manufacturing encourages migration to cities where folks use more electricity and automotive fuel.Simply, without China\u2019s cooperation, U.S. efforts are futile.Progressives propose to bring China and other nations along through diplomacy, but despite considerable effort, the president has not been able to obtain Beijing\u2019s cooperation on climate change, its undervalued currency, or just about anything else that would constrain the Middle Kingdom\u2019s growth.Put bluntly, if man-made emissions are the culprit, then by China\u2019s actions alone global warming is going to happen with the force and fury many fear. The United States can do little to stop it, and efforts to do so will only reduce U.S. resources available to mitigate its consequences.U.S. economic growth has fallen from 3.4 percent during the Reagan-Clinton years to 1.7 percent since the beginning of this century. This slowdown was caused by U.S currency and trade policies toward China that disadvantage U.S. manufacturers, restrictions on offshore oil and gas development that keep America dependent on imports, and costly and ineffective regulations on banking, health care and other industries.Millions of Americans are without decent jobs, and governments at all levels are severely challenged. Those will get worse if the nation continues on its current path.Rising temperatures will confront federal and state agencies with unparalleled challenges, as droughts dislocate cattle ranchers in the Southwest, insects threaten forests, arable regions shift north, rising seas flood coastal cities and new diseases attack humans, plants and animals.Moving populations and economic activities will cost trillions of dollars, and an economy impoverished by mindless micro-management from Washington simply won\u2019t be able to generate the tax dollars to foot the bill.Americans will be forced to abandon farms and cities \u2013 simply, fend for themselves \u2013 as Washington will not be able to sustain the essential elements of civilization.", "headline": "The inconvenient truth about climate change and Obama\u2019s policies", "article_name": "the-inconvenient-truth-about-climate-change-and-obamas-policies", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-inconvenient-truth-about-climate-change-and-obamas-policies", "date_published": "2015-05-07 00:00:00", "article_length": 4853, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:51.467314"}

I was joking with some friends the other day, I said, I came outside, it's pretty balmy. The temperature is 32. I guess it changes.Anyway, I think the problem here is language, to a large extent. Clearly, there is global climate change going on. If you ask a scientists, the people at the national academy of sciences, you ask the people at NASA, what they present to you is not 17 years, as we heard in the clip, Doug. Instead what they talk about is 100-plus years where you can see the trends, the patterns. And what you see is more extremes, colder temperatures as well as warmer temperatures. And what we're seeing in that Fresno, San Joaquin valley area, is I think a drought that is more extreme than anything they have seen in decades.MCKELWAY: Charles, Juan has said this has become politicized. Is it fair to assume that the science of climatology has been politicized in academia as has the rest of academia?CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Well, absolutely. But it's more than political. It's become a kind of religion. The essence of a scientific theory is that you can in principle refute it with empirical evidence, otherwise it's religion, it's a belief. And whatever happens, whether it's cold or warm, whether it's a flood or drought, whether it's pestilence or locusts or any of the plagues, it's always climate change.\u00a0 So if it proves everything, it proves nothing. It's sort of the essence of the denial of scientific rigor.And you know, we've now heard over the last week yet another example, apart from the drought in the West, is the snowmageddon in the East, eight inches of snow in the East Coast. I have an explanation that is not climate change. It's called winter, and it happened every year. It's happened every year for a long time. And to me, it's just plain cynicism to seize upon any event and then to use it as an example of a theory, which is not a way to prove it.And this billion dollars, this attenuation fund, it is going to be exactly like the money that was spent on green energy. It is a slush fund for crony capitalism that will go to favored individuals and companies.\u00a0 It's going to apparently ameliorate the damage from natural events caused by climate change. Well, which drought is climate change? Which flood is climate change? There's no way to adjudicate that. It will be political, as Juan was saying \u2013 the essence is political -- and ultimately, it will be corrupt.MCKELWAY: You described believers as, looking at this as a religion.\u00a0 Michael Crichton, the great novelists wrote about this eloquently, describing how there's an initial Eden, a paradise, a state of grace, a unity with nature, and then we fall from grace by virtue of taking a bite of the forbidden fruit, technology, and we fall into pollution and all seek redemption because judgment day is coming. You want to tackle that, Juan?WILLIAMS: I don't know how -- I think Michael Crichton actually became a doubter, and Michael Crichton --KRAUTHAMMER: And was ostracized because of that in Hollywood.WILLIAMS: I don't know about that part, but I know he became a doubter, as Doug was just reading. My sense is that Michael Crichton was questioning the whole idea because there is such an overwhelming judgment by the scientific community. Today, I was noticing.MCKELWAY: That gets to the point of funding, because critics say it's only because they're getting the funding.WILLIAMS: Look, I think funding is a big issue these days in a period of austerity in general, but 97 percent, that's what the National Academy - - it's not made up. It's what the government says. It's not political.\u00a0 That's what 97 percent of climate scientists say we are experiencing --HAYES: Who did the survey? There is no such survey.WILLIAMS: There is. It's the National Academy of Science.HAYES: There is no such survey. The California example I hear is actually very interesting because what you have is a government that is, because of the Endangered Species Act, has turned off pumps that send water from the Sacramento Delta down south and help provide water for the rest of California. Those pumps have been in effect, on and off a little bit, but basically turned off since 2007. In 2010, it was one of the wettest years on record in California. That water that would have been captured in 2010 could have continued to provide water to California for those intervening years and continuing to this day. And we wouldn't be looking at this as a kind of crisis that it may turn into.And they're doing this to protect this delta smelt, and all in the name of protecting this small little bait fish they have in effect redone California and its water. And I spoke with Congressman Devin Nunez before I came on tonight, and he said that the government kills more smelt looking for smelt than the pumps kill.(CROSSTALK)MCKELWAY: -- to try to re-create new places for salmon, which is their ancestral homeland, apparently \u2013 there are some rivers in Northern California. More water being diverted, Charles.KRAUTHAMMER: Look in the end, all the remedies that they talk about, Obama and the others, especially the EPA wants to shut down U.S. coal because it puts carbon in the atmosphere, is utterly useless. The United States is six percent of the population of the world, with India and China and the other tigers in the third world developing, spewing carbon into the atmosphere, no matter what is done here, will have zero effect on climate. And that's why even if you accept all of the climate science, all of it, there is nothing that we can do unilaterally in the U.S. other than destroy our own economy.MCKELWAY: Out of time, gentleman. You get the last word, Charles.

We have to understand that California, like so many other parts of the country, has experienced extreme weather conditions,\u201d the Democratic vice presidential nominee said, pointing to heat, drought and lightning strikes the state has faced in recent weeks.Harris also paid tribute to firefighters in the state. \u201dWhile their own homes are burning... they are working around the clock without rest. I just heard about how they've been working 90-hour shifts, some of them--to save families, to save property, to slow down the fire and its devastation.\u201dNewsom praised Harris\u2019 remarks on climate change. \u201cClimate change is real. If you don't believe in science, come to California and observe it with your own eyes. You cannot be in denial about this reality.\u201dOn Monday, President Trump and Newsom met for a roundtable discussion to discuss the flames engulfing the Golden State and much of the West Coast.Newsom thanked the president for the federal help he\u2019d given to California, but acknowledged their differing views on the cause of the wildfires.\u201cI want to thank you and acknowledge the work you have done to be immediate in your response,\u201d Newsom told Trump during the meeting at the Sacramento McClellan Airport. He added that the help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been \u201cprofoundly significant.\u201dAt the urging on Newsom back in late August, Trump approved a disaster declaration for California and ordered federal funding to be directed to the state.The president, meanwhile, has repeatedly blamed the state for poor forest management. He\u2019s called on Newsom to \"clean\" or rake the forest floors of debris while suggesting the state implement controlled burns.The president reiterated on Monday that California needs to do better forest management \u2013 a remark that Newsom acknowledged.\u201cWe have not done justice to our forest management,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe acknowledge our role and response.\u201dNewsom, however, did note that a large portion of the land in California is federally owned and that he believes climate change has drastically contributed to the intensity of the fires.Wildfires have grown increasingly common. California, for instance, recorded 43 from 1980 to 1999 \u2013 but 300 from 2000 to 2019. Oregon had no wildfires from 1980 to 1999 but 63 over the past 20 years, according to federal data analyzed by the insurance website QuoteWizard.All five of the costliest fires in U.S. history, measured by insured losses, have occurred in the last three years, all in California, according to the Insurance Information Institute.

{"id": null, "body": "Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina provides insight on \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom.\u2019Across the world, politicians are now\u00a0promising\u00a0 costing tens of trillions of dollars \u2013\u00a0money we don\u2019t have and resources that are desperately needed elsewhere.Yet, climate campaigners tell us, if we don\u2019t spend everything on climate now, nothing else matters, because climate change\u00a0threatens our very civilization. As \u00a0says: climate change is \"an existential threat\".Yes,  is a real problem. However, it is typically vastly exaggerated, and the resulting alarmism is exploited to justify the wasteful spending of trillions.Pointing this out will get you canceled. I should know, because I have personally been on the receiving end of this climate alarmism enforcement for years. I was recently scheduled to give a public lecture at Duke University when a group of climate-politicized professors \u2013\u00a0some who write for the UN Climate Panel \u2013\u00a0publicly asked Duke to cancel my appearance.One of my presentation points was highlighting the latest full U.N. Climate Panel report that\u00a0estimates the total cost of climate change. They found that unmitigated climate change in half a century will reduce general welfare equivalent to lowering each person\u2019s income by between 0.2 and 2%.Given that the U.N. expects each person on the planet to be much better off \u2013\u00a0363%\u00a0as wealthy as today \u2013\u00a0climate might cause us to only be 356%\u00a0as rich by then. That is a problem, but certainly not the end of the world.Why don\u2019t most people know this? Because stories of catastrophe and human guilt garner more clicks and are better for weaponizing political arguments. Unfortunately, we\u2019re unlikely to make good decisions if we\u2019re panicked.\u00a0The political forces looking to spend the climate trillions and the academia segment supplying the fear want to scrub the climate debate of anything but the scariest scenarios. They want an unwavering allegiance to vigorous spending on climate policy, no matter its effectiveness. They insist on treating this issue as a moral binary choice instead of a realistic balancing of costs and effectiveness that would allow for our many other challenges to be heard as well.The easiest way to get societies to authorize the spending of tens of trillions we don\u2019t have is to scare us.Certainly, the professors at Duke didn\u2019t want anyone to hear dissenting facts.They tried to stop the lecture through outright lies, such as claiming that my funding comes from Exxon and the Koch brothers. These claims are\u00a0categorically untrue. They also declared that I had been deemed scientifically dishonest, although the mock trial that\u00a0\u00a0originated that claim has been\u00a0completely overturned and annulled\u00a0because it contained no arguments.More worryingly, they raged about how climate catastrophes are so terrible that we should not allow any more climate debate. Yet, their claims were almost uniformly untrue.They said that \"much of the Australian continent\" had been devoured in climate-induced fire. But we know from satellite measurements, published in\u00a0Nature,\u00a0that while the fires near population centers had severe impacts, the total land area burned was 4%\u00a0\u2013\u00a0one of the lowest-ever percentages, from an\u00a0average\u00a0this century of 6.2%\u00a0and last century of 10.1%.Four percent is not \"much of the Australian continent.\" Such claims are more like rantings from people who have been watching too much alarmist TV.They claimed that \"countless lives\" are being lost to climate-related disasters worldwide. Yet, the\u00a0International Disaster Database\u00a0shows that in the 2010s, 18,357 people died each year from climate-related impacts such as floods, droughts, storms, wildfire and extreme temperatures. That is the lowest death count in the past century, a 96%\u00a0decline since the 1920s, despite a larger global population. And 2020 had an even lower death count at 8,086.Yet, we can only know this when we\u2019re allowed to hear facts presented. Thankfully, Duke University didn\u2019t cave to their craven arguments (you can\u00a0), but the attempts to suppress free speech, facts and knowledge continue.The easiest way to get societies to authorize the spending of tens of trillions we don\u2019t have is to scare us. The academic and activist faction that sets the threatening tone in the climate conversation want dissent eliminated, leaving themselves the only ones authorized to tell you how scared you should be.

(AP Photo/Gemunu Amarasinghe, File) WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Earth is sick with multiple and worsening environmental ills killing millions of people yearly,\u00a0a new U.N. report\u00a0says.Climate change, a global major extinction of animals and plants, a human population soaring toward 10 billion, degraded land, polluted air, and plastics, pesticides and hormone-changing chemicals in the water are making the planet an increasing unhealthy place for people, says the scientific report issued once every few years.But it may not be too late.\"There is every reason to be hopeful,\" report co-editors Joyeeta Gupta and Paul Ekins told The Associated Press in an email. \"There is still time but the window is closing fast.\"The sixth Global Environment Outlook, released Wednesday at a U.N. conference in Nairobi, Kenya, painted a dire picture of a planet where environmental problems interact with each other to make things even more dangerous for people. It uses the word \"risk\" 561 times in a 740-page report.The report concludes \"unsustainable human activities globally have degraded the Earth's ecosystems, endangering the ecological foundations of society.\"But the same document says changes in the way the world eats, buys things, gets its energy and handles its waste could help fix the problems.The report is \"a dramatic warning and a high-level road map for what must be done to prevent widespread disruption and even irreversible destruction of planetary life-support systems,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the report.Several other scientists also praised the report, which draws on existing science, data and maps.\"This report clearly shows the connections between the environment and human health and well-being,\" said Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist.Gupta and Ekins, environmental scientists in Amsterdam and London, said air pollution annually kills 7 million people worldwide and costs society about $5 trillion. Water pollution, with associated diseases, kills another 1.4 million.The scientists said the most important and pressing problems facing humankind are global warming and loss of biodiversity because they are permanent and affect so many people in so many different ways.CLIMATE CHANGE\"Time is running out to prevent the irreversible and dangerous impacts of climate change,\" the report says, noting that unless something changes, global temperatures will exceed the threshold of warming \u2014 another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) above current temperatures \u2014 that international agreements call dangerous.The report details climate change impacts on human health, air, water, land and biodiversity. Almost all coastal cities and small island nations are increasingly vulnerable to flooding from rising seas and extreme weather.BIODIVERSITY\"A major species extinction event, compromising planetary integrity and Earth's capacity to meet human needs, is unfolding,\" the report says, listing threats to ecosystems, fisheries and other major systems. It notes conservationists are divided on whether Earth is in a sixth mass extinction.AIR POLLUTIONNot only are millions of people dying each year, but unhealthy air especially hurts \"the elderly, very young, ill and poor,\" the report says.WATER POLLUTIONWhile 1.5 billion people now get clean drinking water they lacked in 2000, water quality in many regions has worsened, the report says.Plastics and other litter have invaded every ocean at all depths, the report says.ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCEPeople getting sick from diseases caused by antimicrobial resistant bacteria in water supplies could become a major cause of death worldwide by 2050, unless something can be done about it, the report says.LAND DEGRADATIONLand is getting less fertile and useful.

{"id": null, "body": "It takes much more than warm ocean temperatures to produce and sustain a hurricane, says Roy Spencer, principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and author of 'Inevitable Disaster: Why Hurricanes Can't Be Blamed on Global Warming.'When it comes to the world\u2019s changing climate, many Democrats have been wearing blinders. If you\u2019ve been paying attention to what the  are saying on climate, make sure you look for the big picture.Yes,  is real, and industrial activity is contributing to it. Economic impacts are clearly rising. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration finds that the five-year running average of damage of weather events has risen over the past 20 years from $20 billion a year to $100 billion a year.But too often, liberal Democrats assume socialist command and control approaches \u2013 mixed with federal jobs guarantees and universal health care \u2013 are the only solutions.The Democrats point out that global carbon dioxide emissions have increased to record highs and rightly discuss the urgent need to reverse the trend. But where are their realistic solutions?As Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who serves on the House Energy Committee, has written, \u201cwe want America\u2019s innovators to develop the next technologies that will improve the environment and create jobs here at home.\u201dHere are five critical pieces the Democratic presidential candidates have been ignoring that Republicans haven\u2019t missed.While the Democratic candidates are correct on the urgency of the problem of climate change, they haven't acknowledged what\u2019s actually reduced the carbon emissions most. The reductions have come about because of the natural gas revolution right here in the United States, which has lowered our power prices and cut grid emissions by 20 percent.Future gas technologies hold even more promise. Look at NET Power, a North Carolina company working on an emissions-free natural gas power plant as a $150 million proof-of-concept facility. The development of similar clean fossil fuel technologies would be supported by a bill in Congress called the Launching Energy Advancement through Innovations in Natural Gas (LEADING Act).Democrats ignore or downplay the most important source of zero-emission energy in the U.S. \u2013 nuclear power, or as I call it, the global clean energy workhorse.Nuclear power produces carbon-free energy 24/7 and is incredibly resilient in the face of increasing natural disasters. During Hurricane Harvey, a Texas nuclear power plant continued to operate at full throttle for 2 million customers, despite 130 mph gusts outside its front door.The presidential candidates could support bipartisan policies like the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act. Such policies support new nuclear power plant designs that could be used in military bases, heavy industry and the civilian grid. Unfortunately, several of the top candidates turn up their nose to nuclear power.While they talk a lot about renewables, the Democratic presidential candidates ignore the renewable resource-producing enough clean electricity to power more than 20 million homes in America \u2013 hydropower. It's clean, affordable and can be counted on for backup power.These benefits make hydro the fourth-largest electricity source after natural gas, coal and nuclear power.Although hydropower is one of the most affordable ways to make and store electricity, since the 1960s the stream of hydropower development gradually slowed to a trickle. Here\u2019s a free hint to the candidates \u2013 talk about fixing hydropower\u2019s bureaucratic licensing process, because it can take more than a decade, driving up costs on prospective developers.We don't hear about the problem known as \"leakage.\" If we impose expensive regulations on our industries to reduce emissions \u2013 and those industries don\u2019t have low-cost emissions control technologies, or cleaner alternatives, ready to deploy \u2013 they are encouraged to move production abroad to places with less strict emissions controls. This could simply shift manufacturing abroad without a global emissions benefit.Developing more affordable clean technologies would help prevent leakage. We pioneered the first wave of clean energy technologies, including the first solar cell, hydroelectric facility and nuclear power plant.

As population and economies grow in developing regions, they are demanding more and more affordable energy options.The current energy choices available to developing nations are less than desirable for the climate. Since 2000, coal power in China has nearly quadrupled.

{"id": null, "body": "RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel reacts to CNN's marathon town hall with 2020 Democrats on climate change.Whether you accept or reject the\u00a0\u00a0narrative, most people agree that we should avoid pouring massive amounts of anything with potentially harmful consequences into the atmosphere.There is scientific evidence that excessive levels of carbon in the atmosphere could adversely impact our \u00a0\u2013\u00a0and we are emitting a lot of carbon.What interests me is that the\u00a0\u00a0about\u00a0catastrophic climate change are the same people who vigorously oppose the most practical and effective means of combating it.According to BP\u2019s 2019\u00a0, an energy economics publication, global\u00a0carbon emissions grew about 2 percent\u00a0in 2018 to 33,890.8 million metric tons, due primarily to increased demand for heating and cooling services.While U.S. carbon emissions also increased in 2018, the U.S.\u00a0has been the world\u2019s leader in reducing carbon emissions for over a decade. the U.S. Energy Information Administration,\u00a0carbon emissions in this country\u00a0declined 14 percent\u00a0between 2005 and 2017, \u201cmainly because more electricity has been generated from natural gas\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a more efficient and \u201cless carbon-intensive fuel than either coal or petroleum.\u201dThe EIA is \u00a0a 2.2 percent\u00a0decline in U.S. carbon emissions in\u00a02019 as natural gas continues to replace coal in generating electricity.\u00a0 Fortunately, we have natural gas in abundance,\u00a0thanks to a private sector-developed extraction process known as fracking.Fracking does release methane gas, but according to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 2018\u00a0, released in April 2019, U.S. methane emissions declined 15.8 percent between 1990 and 2017, while natural gas production increased by 51 percent.More energy, less methane and carbon.\u00a0 Sounds like progress.Nonetheless, virtually every Democratic presidential candidate who participated in CNN\u2019s recent seven-hour climate change marathon opposes fracking.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, said she would\u00a0\u201cban fracking \u2013\u00a0everywhere\u201d on her first day as president, a mandate that would undoubtedly increase our carbon emissions.\u00a0 Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., never one to rigidly tether his policies to reality, would\u00a0\u201cban fracking on all public and private lands.\u201dIn any event, reducing the world\u2019s carbon emissions is not something any American\u00a0president alone can achieve.\u00a0 While U.S.\u00a0emissions are significant and should be reduced, they constitute only 15.2 percent\u00a0of the world\u2019s total.China emitted 27.8 percent, or 9,428.7 million metric tons, of carbon in 2018.\u00a0That\u2019s more than the U.S. (5,145.2 million) and the European Union (4,248.4 million) combined.To reduce emissions we need plausible alternatives. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are currently incapable of meeting the world's energy demands on their own.As respected environmentalist and former renewables advocate Michael Shallenberger explains in a piece in Quillette magazine titled \",\" both wind and solar\u00a0currently lack the capacity to generate or store sufficient energy to meet global demand.Hydroelectric and geothermal energy production are limited geographically.\u00a0 With current technology, renewables alone simply are not a viable alternative.Instead, Shallenberger has become an advocate of nuclear energy \u2013\u00a0a safe and inexpensive means of\u00a0significantly reducing\u00a0carbon emissions.Nuclear energy already cleanly supplies over 10 percent of the world\u2019s electricity and, according to a February 2019 report\u00a0from the World Nuclear Association, almost all reports \"on future energy supply from major organizations suggest an increasing role for nuclear power as an environmentally benign way of producing reliable electricity on a large scale.\u201dClearly, certain Democrats\u00a0are more determined to scare us into accepting socialism than in reducing carbon emissions.\u00a0 Otherwise, why reject effective solutions that we know will reduce \u2013\u00a0and are today reducing \u2013\u00a0carbon emissions without reversing the incredible progress\u00a0we have made since the Industrial Revolution in reducing extreme poverty, hunger\u00a0and infant mortality - increasing life expectancy and improving standards of living to the highest levels in human history.In fact, it\u2019s difficult to take anyone seriously who rails against increased carbon emissions but either\u00a0refuses to consider nuclear power as part of the mix (Sanders),\u00a0opposes building new reactors (former vice president Joe Biden), or declines to take a position on nuclear energy (Warren).Opposing not only natural gas but also nuclear energy raises the question of what Democrats are actually trying to accomplish under the guise of climate change.\u00a0There have been some clues.Saikat Chakrabarti,\u00a0New York Democratic Rep.\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s former chief of staff, admitted\u00a0in July that the true motivation behind the Green New Deal wasn\u2019t a \u201cclimate thing.\u201d\u00a0 It was \u201ca how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing,\u201d\u00a0 he said.That helps explain why progressives are attempting to generate climate panic while opposing practical means for reducing carbon emissions.\u00a0It also explains why they favor massive tax increases, excessively burdensome regulation and spending virtually incomprehensible sums on far less effective,\u00a0 if not ineffective,\u00a0approaches.Clearly, certain Democrats\u00a0are more determined to scare us into accepting socialism than in reducing carbon emissions.Otherwise, why reject effective solutions that we know will reduce \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0carbon emissions without reversing the incredible progress\u00a0we have made since the Industrial Revolution in reducing extreme poverty, hunger\u00a0and infant mortality --\u00a0 increasing life expectancy and improving\u00a0standards of living to the highest levels in human history.We have the means to reduce carbon emissions without rendering ourselves subservient to a class of government elites, surrendering our freedoms, or destroying our\u00a0economy \u2013 despite the left\u2019s continuing attempts to scare us into serfdom.", "headline": "Andy Puzder: Here's why Dems want to generate climate panic (as they ignore ways to reduce carbon emissions)", "article_name": "andy-puzder-democrats-climate-panic-carbon-emissions", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andy-puzder-democrats-climate-panic-carbon-emissions", "date_published": "2019-09-12 00:00:00", "article_length": 5930, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:16:59.398005"}

{"id": null, "body": "\n        Climate change trashed the Byzantine Empire, ancient garbage mounds revealed. About a century before the fall of the Byzantine Empire \u2014 the eastern portion of the vast Roman Empire \u2014 signs of its impending doom were written in garbage.Archaeologists recently investigated accumulated refuse in trash mounds at a Byzantine settlement called Elusa in Israel's Negev Desert . They found that the age of the trash introduced an intriguing new timeline for the Byzantine decline, scientists reported in a new study. []The researchers discovered that trash disposal \u2014 once a well-organized and reliable service in outpost cities like Elusa \u2014 ceased around the middle of the sixth century, about 100 years prior to the empire's collapse. At that time, a climate event known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age was taking hold in the Northern Hemisphere, and an epidemic known as the Justinian plague raged through the Roman Empire, eventually killing over 100 million people .Together, disease and climate change took a devastating economic toll and loosened Rome's grip on its lands to the east a century earlier than once thought, according to the study.Elusa was already partly excavated, but the new investigation was the first to explore the site's long-ignored trash heaps, lead study author Guy Bar-Oz, a professor of archaeology at the University of Haifa in Israel, told Live Science in an email.Unlike the architecture of an ancient city, which could be repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, landfills steadily accumulated over time, creating continuous records of human activity. Clues found in preserved garbage dumps could thereby reveal if a city was thriving or in trouble.\"For me, it was clear that the true gold mine of data about daily life and what urban existence in the past really looked like was in the garbage,\" Bar-Oz said.In the dump sites, the scientists found a variety of objects: ceramic pot sherds, seeds, olive pits, charcoal from burned wood and even evidence of discarded \"gourmet foods\" imported from the Red Sea and the Nile, the study authors reported.The scientists carbon-dated organic material such as seeds and charcoal in layers of trash mounds located near the city. They found that trash had built up in that location over a period of about 150 years and that the accumulation terminated in the middle of the sixth century. This suggested there was a failure of infrastructure, which happens when a city is about to collapse, the researchers noted.Based on the new evidence, researchers concluded that Elusa's decline began at least a century before Islamic rule wrested control of the region from the Romans. In fact, Elusa was struggling during a period that was relatively peaceful and stable; it was during this time that the Roman Emperor Justinian was expanding the empire's boundaries across Europe, Africa and Asia, Bar-Oz said.With the empire enjoying \"a period of glorious success,\" it would seem logical to expect that its outposts would be financially secure, Bar-Oz said. Yet the data the researchers collected suggested the opposite.\"Instead, we are seeing a signal for what was really going on at that time and which has long been nearly invisible to most archaeologists \u2014 that the empire was being plagued by climatic disaster and disease,\" Bar-Oz explained.The findings were published online today (March 25) in the journal .", "headline": "Ancient garbage heaps show fading Byzantine Empire was 'plagued' by disease and climate change", "article_name": "ancient-garbage-heaps-show-fading-byzantine-empire-was-plagued-by-disease-and-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/ancient-garbage-heaps-show-fading-byzantine-empire-was-plagued-by-disease-and-climate-change", "date_published": "2019-03-26 00:00:00", "article_length": 3383, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:06.883126"}

The choice for voters in clear,\" said RNC National Press Secretary Blair Ellis.First as a congressman, and now as a two-term governor, Inslee has spent decades as a leading advocate for reducing rising carbon levels in the atmosphere to reduce the effects of climate change.His latest efforts come as many progressive Democrats in Congress \u2013 as well as some of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination \u2013 have embraced the Green New Deal, the sweeping proposal that aims to transform the country\u2019s economy to fight climate change\u00a0while enacting a host of new health care and welfare programs.But Inslee, who\u2019s making combating climate change his top issue in his White House bid, is spotlighting his own plan rather than signing onto the Green New Deal.The plan would marshal 28 new or existing programs to shift U.S energy markets from fossil fuel dependence to renewable sources; transform U.S. automobile manufacturing and construction practices; and remake the nation's infrastructure from public transit to municipal water and rural electric cooperatives.Inslee projects about $300 billion in annual government spending over the first decade of the plan, with incentives he says will generate about $600 billion in matching private sector investment on everything from expanding solar energy to rebuilding dilapidating water systems like the Flint, Michigan, infrastructure that has garnered national headlines.Among Inslee's ideas are a ReBuild America program that would help retrofit existing public and private structures to meet new energy standards and a new version of the post-World War II \"G.I. Bill\" targeted to help coal industry workers who lose jobs in a transition to renewable energy. The coal worker aide would include guarantees for health insurance and pension benefits, in addition to funds for career training.Inslee unveiled his plan at an event at Washington D.C.\u2019s wastewater treatment plant, which his campaign noted treats one billion gallons of water each day and uses cutting-edge technology to turn waste into 10 megawatts of electricity.", "headline": "Inslee unveils $9 trillion plan to battle climate change", "article_name": "jay-inslee-plan-9-trillion-to-battle-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jay-inslee-plan-9-trillion-to-battle-climate-change", "date_published": "2019-05-16 00:00:00", "article_length": 3540, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:07.543714"}

{"id": null, "body": " As the  conference begins this week in Glasgow, Scotland, keep in mind two numbers: 1.5 and 45.Most world leaders have agreed to the scientific consensus view that the  is a ticking time bomb. If temperatures increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) the world cannot avoid catastrophic climate change.To avoid this, the roughly 100 heads of state attending must agree to cuts that collectively equal a net global emissions reduction of greenhouse gases of 45% by 2030, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\u00a0To achieve that figure, the U.N. Environmental Program says countries must cut greenhouse gas emissions by 7.6% annually over the next eight years. Every fraction of a degree of warming, a U.N. panel says, will produce more wildfires, floods and famine.There are two ways to get there. One uses natural gas as a bridge fuel to augment wind and solar. The other ends all new fossil fuel production. Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., says that would be a disaster.\"We're going to have a 50% increase in energy demand globally over the next 29 years, a 40% increase in natural gas demand,\" he says. \"We can either provide those clean energy solutions out of the United States or we can allow China to service those countries and that demand, we can allow Vladimir Putin to do it. It doesn't make sense.\"The Biden administration proposes the U.S. reduce its emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030, roughly double the U.S.' previous goal. The 27 nations of the E.U. vowed to reduce their emissions by 55% below 1990 levels by 2030, or roughly 7% a year. Earlier this year, Japan raised its targeted reduction to 46% from 26% from 2013 levels.\"We are determined to meet our goal of a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030,\" says Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. \"The planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rules for planets. We have to pass this legislation now.\"The legislation Markey supports and  proposes rewards utilities that replace coal and natural gas with wind and solar, while penalizing those that don't. In the transportation sector, Biden favors subsidies of up to $12,500 to purchase electric cars.There are five major greenhouse gases. The largest, carbon dioxide, comes from two\u00a0major sources, vehicles and power plants., the world\u2019s largest polluter, says its emissions are still rising but should peak before 2030. It pledges to spend more on nuclear and renewables, but last year it added three-quarters of all the world\u2019s new coal plants, according to Global Energy Monitor. Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels.Other major emitters, like  and , have not submitted any new pledges to cut their pollution.\u00a0, a big exporter of coal and a large per capita emitter of greenhouse gases, has not submitted an aggressive climate plan but claims it will produce net zero carbon emissions by 2050, matching U.S. and E.U. targets.These promises, which are not binding but aspirational, are known as \"nationally determined contributions\" or NDCs. There is no enforcement or penalty for failing to meet them and so far, based on the pledges following the Paris Agreement of 2015, collectively the world will fall short.\u00a0Because of a \"commitment gap\" between what countries say and what they do \u2013 the planet is on track to heat roughly 2.7 Celsius (above pre-industrial times). The U.N. says world leaders need to cut emissions five to seven times faster than currently pledged to avert disaster.\u00a0It\u2019s possible to limit global warming to 2.2 Celsius by 2100 if countries all live up to their Glasgow pledges. If they only meet targets agreed to in Paris, temperatures will rise 3.2 degrees.Aside from the dueling pledges and carbon shaming, watch for the fight between developed nations like the U.S. and those in the E.U. versus China, India and others where hundreds of millions still don\u2019t have electricity.\u00a0Developing nations argue the industrial giants of the West polluted the world and now they are being asked to pay for it \u2013 with equal cuts despite a much lower standard of living. The G20 (a group of 19 countries and the EU) account for 78% of all emissions.Countries vulnerable to climate change want $100 billion to help handle the natural disasters developed countries caused \u2013 heat waves, crop shortages, hurricanes and wildfires.Climate optimists look to several fronts: Market forces have reduced the price of wind and solar; the cost of battery storage is falling; the adoption of electric cars is quickly growing; and the world\u2019s seven largest economies have agreed to stop financially supporting new coal projects overseas.\u00a0Though often condemned for generating the second-highest greenhouse gases per capita after , the U.S. actually reduced its emissions faster than any other nation in the last decade, followed by .William La Jeunesse joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in March 1998 and currently serves as a Senior National Correspondent.", "headline": "With COP26 climate change conference underway, world leaders look toward drastic cuts in emissions", "article_name": "world-leaders-drastic-cuts-emissions-un-climate-conference", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/world-leaders-drastic-cuts-emissions-un-climate-conference", "date_published": "2021-11-01 00:00:00", "article_length": 4902, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:08.842023"}
{"id": null, "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines for Jan. 1 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comWill the world end in 12 years? Maybe 30?If history is any guide, it will not. Many similar predictions have been made in the past, but they came and went without\u00a0tragedy.Here are the five worst predictions made about 2020 that failed to pan out.In 1990, The Washington Post reported in a front page story: \"Carbon dioxide is the gas most responsible for\u00a0predictions\u00a0that Earth will warm on average by about 3 degrees Fahrenheit by\u00a0the year\u00a02020.\"The outlet further warned: \"The United States, because it occupies a large continent in higher latitudes, could warm by as much as 6 degrees Fahrenheit.\"Thirty\u00a0years later, 2020 has finally arrived. The Earth has warmed approximately 1 degree Fahrenheit\u00a0. The United States also warmed roughly 1 degree.Elliott Negin, a spokesman for the Union of Concerned Scientists, declined to comment.The latest , however, addresses the issue of whether their models were accurate. (The UN predictions differed from the 1990 Washington Post ones, which did not cite its source.)The latest UN report shows that current temperatures are just within the UN\u2019s old predictions made in 1990, but acknowledges that actual temperatures came in \u201con the lower end\u201d of expectations.The UN report partly credits a 1991 volcanic eruption in the Philippines for the lower-than-expected warming, and says the new models account for volcanoes.The UN now predicts a rise of about 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit from today to the year 2100.CNN ran a headline in 2003\u00a0\u00a0\"World oil and gas 'running out'\".The New York Times reported in 1989 that \"untapped pools of domestic oil are finite and dwindling,\" and that \"William Stevens, the president of Exxon U.S.A., said ... by the year 2020\u00a0there would not be enough domestic oil left 'to keep me interested.'\"But doomsayers underestimated American ingenuity, and the opposite happened. Both U.S. oil output and U.S. proven oil reserves are\u00a0\u00a0than they were in 1989, thanks to technology allowing deeper oil to be discovered and extracted.New technology in natural gas (\"fracking\") also allowed the U.S. to become an energy independent net oil exporter\u00a0\u00a0in 2018.Reached by phone, Phillip Shabecoff, the former New York Times reporter who covered the disappearing oil in 1989, said that the Exxon CEO\u2019s 2020 prediction was off.\u201cI\u2019m not Nostradamus,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cit\u2019s what the Exxon CEO said. He obviously did not anticipate the new fracking and gas technology. At the time the Permean Basin was being drained dry, so he had every reason to believe we were running out of oil,\u201d Shabecoff said.Marian Tupy, who tracks  at HumanProgress.org, told Fox News that people routinely underestimate humanity.\u201cPeople only think about how can we solve things with current technology. They underestimate human ingenuity,\u201d he said.Shabecoff said that\u00a0\u201cunfortunately, human ingenuity is often undermined by political ideology and greed, so we have not been able to bring human ingenuity to bear on urgent questions like climate change.\u201d\"It's now estimated that by the year 2020, there will be no glaciers of Mt. Kilimanjaro,\" Christian Lambrechts, an officer at the U.N. Environment Program, told CNN in 2003.The  in 2007 that \u201cin 2001, [glaciologist Lonnie] Thompson predicted the snows of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania would disappear within the next 20 years.\u201dBut today, Kilimanjaro's glaciers are still there, according to a 2019 paper in the\u00a0\u00a0that\u00a0includes photos\u00a0and a new timetable: \"most of glaciers on Kilimanjaro ... will most likely disappear within 25 years.\"Lonnie Thompson defended his prediction and said it was a bit different from how the AP summarized it. \u201cMy prediction was that there would be no glaciers, and that is true,\u201d he told Fox News by phone.\u201cWhat we have now are ice bodies. The definition of a glacier is ice in motion. To be ice in motion, you have to have an accumulation zone. There\u2019s been no recent accumulation. There are no glaciers on Kilimanjaro,\u201d he said.Asked about the study calling the current snow on the mountain \u201cglaciers\u201d, he said: \u201cSometimes people get caught up in semantics. The fact is all the glaciers in the tropics are disappearing.\u201dIn 2000,\u00a0\u00a0about 2020.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But it missed big when predicting a \"grisly reality\" of tech-caused inequality: \"For [virtual reality pioneer Jaron] Lanier, the most heartbreaking scenario is festering in the third world, where, he believes, the current generation ... will be lost in the next techno-revolution ... \u2018You're going to have to somehow live while you watch a billion people starve...'\"But from 2000 to 2020, global extreme poverty\u00a0, according to the World Bank, as technology connected the world and allowed people in developing nations to access capital, production know-how, and aid from developed countries.Lanier told Fox News that his prediction was really more about how poverty would be \u201cmore in your face\u201d due to technology and said that the developing world could still collapse by, say, 2030.\u201cIt is true that poverty has fallen... but the developing world is headed towards a reckoning.\u00a0I still worry about Lagos [Nigeria] in 2030.\u00a0Look at the population projections. Where will the water come from?...\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019ll stand by what I said for now, but I still hope to be proven wrong,\u201d he added.Reuters newswire ran this headline in 1997: \"'Millions will die' unless climate policies change.\"The report said 8 million people would die by 2020, citing a prediction in the Lancet medical journal.The mass death prediction was clearly\u00a0way off.\u201cNone of these predictions came true, and aren't even close to coming true,\u201d said Roy Spencer, a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. \u201cIt's amazing that the public can continue to believe apocalyptic predictions despite .\u201dSome modern studies claim to find mass deaths; the Daily Beast covered a \u201cshock report\u201d that \u201cClimate Change Kills 400,000 a Year,\u201d but Human Progress'\u00a0Marian Tupy said such estimates are grossly inflated.\u201cThey say climate change causes everything. Some people try to pin the war on Syria on climate change, and then say when all those people die, that's because of climate change. They have a secondary agenda,\u201d Tupy said.The five predictions highlighted here join a host of similar failed predictions \u00a0 that Fox News tracked.Tupy said that an overly negative view of humanity may be one cause of the bad predictions.\u201cHumans are not a curse upon the planet, but are actually a benefit, because we are problem-solvers. We are creators, not destroyers, on average.\u201d\u201cWhen people ask you when was the best time to be alive \u2013 the answer is, tomorrow,\u201d he added.", "headline": "Top 5 most outrageous 2020 doomsday predictions that didn't pan out", "article_name": "top-5-most-outrageous-2020-doomsday-predictions", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/top-5-most-outrageous-2020-doomsday-predictions", "date_published": "2020-01-01 00:00:00", "article_length": 6724, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:09.568650"}

No, India's life expectancy increased by almost 16 years and China's increased by almost 10,\" Epstein wrote.\"Any study about fossil fuels' side-effects must prominently mention their life-extending benefits. But modern studies, funded by governments with anti-fossil fuel agendas, systematically ignore fossil fuels' benefits and wildly overstate side-effects,\" Epstein continued.\u00a0Nevertheless, Atkin was also insistent on wildly overstating the threat of climate change as well as blaming fossil fuels for the damage.\"Yeah, it's not an excuse that you need to talk to a climate scientist anymore to include something in your story that says this extreme heat event was made more likely by climate change, and it's a part of our climate change future,\" Atkin stated. \"And what I would also argue is that you should probably have a sentence in there saying climate change is caused by fossil fuels because climate change is not something that's happening to us\u2014it's something that's being done to us.\"In the past, experts, reporters, and politicians environmental doomsday for humans with all the predictions turning out wrong.

But it's not,\" Kerry said. \"It is coming from global warming and it threatens all the normal weather patterns.\"Winter Storm Uri brought ice and snow to swaths of the U.S. that rarely see such low temperatures. States like Texas were caught off guard, and millions were left without power as the electric grid was overwhelmed with the demand for heat. Tuesday was the coldest day in North Texas in 72 years, and the Dallas- Fort Worth area reached a record low of minus two degrees Fahrenheit this week.\u00a0The warning from Kerry came as the U.S. formally reentered the Paris Climate Agreement Friday. Still, he stressed that joining the agreement would not be enough.\u00a0\"Even if we did everything that we said we were going to do when we signed up in Paris, we would see a rise in the Earth's temperature to somewhere around 3.7 degrees or more, which is catastrophic,\" Kerry said.\"We know that just doing Paris is not enough,\" Kerry said during an event for climate action group America is All In. \"If every country delivered, we\u2019d still see a warming planet Earth.\"The Biden administration, determined to reinstate most of the 100 climate regulations former President Trump rolled back, is expected to release a new set of emissions reduction goals before Earth Day this year. The goal of the Biden administration is toget the U.S. to net-zero emissions by 2050.Climate change is widely blamed for both warming and droughts, fires and hurricanes, but scientists are divided on whether such unusual cold snaps are linked to it. Some argue that warming temperatures in the Arctic can push frigid polar air south, leading to colder temperatures in the short term. The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the planet. The link between climate change and the behavior of the polar vortex is not yet clear. Other researchers say climate change will make frigid weather events less likely.\u00a0\"He\u2019s not entirely correct,\" Texas State climatologist John Neilsen-Gammon told Fox News. \"In Texas, when we get cold we get it from the Arctic, it doesn\u2019t form here, it has to move here. The direct temperature effect [of climate change] on cold weather would make extreme cold weather in Texas milder. But dynamically there\u2019s decent evidence that jet stream patterns may be disrupted by climate change and could lead to bigger excursions of the jet to low latitudes and could make cold extremes more severe.

Scientists aren't positive precisely how events played out, but the runaway greenhouse effect that resulted is beyond debate: Venus now clocks in at a  (471 degrees Celsius).\"I think Venus is an important warning: Greenhouse atmospheres are not theoretical,\" , director of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum and former chief scientist at NASA, told Space.com. And in fact, Venus has already warned us about a climate threat \u2014 Stofan said that it was studying our neighbor that prompted scientists to look for an ozone hole here on Earth. They found it, and in perhaps the only veritable , international agreements have cut production of the compounds that eat away at ozone. []Much of the appeal of Venus comes from the fact that despite its horrifying modern appearance, it's actually really similar to Earth. \"Picture a planet that's just like Earth but it's a little hotter because it's a little closer to the sun \u2014 and that would be Venus,\" David Grinspoon, a planetary scientist and astrobiologist at the Planetary Science Institute, told Space.com.Along with Mars, these planets form a trio of worlds that began with comparable sizes, materials and temperatures \u2014 until suddenly, they were very different. Once upon a time, Venus, like Earth today, was , perhaps even habitable. Then, gradually, something fell out of whack. \"The basic mechanism is very simple: Everybody knows that if you heat up water you make steam,\" Grinspoon said. And water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas, trapping still more heat. \"There's nothing to really stop it until the oceans fully evaporate.\" (Today, Venus' atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide; radiation from the sun likely broke up the water vapor, letting it escape into space.)The divergent paths of Earth and its two neighbors pose an existential dilemma more powerful even than anthropogenic climate change: Humans or no, Earth's cozy environment won't last forever, either. \"We think of  like, 'Oh, you have a habitable planet and it just stays that way,'\" Stofan said. \"Habitability can be very transient in a planet's history.\" Of the three, Earth's habitability window has lasted the longest, and Venus' was probably shorter than Mars, but scientists aren't yet sure by just how much, she added.At a strictly intellectual level, data from Venus and Mars about how a planet and its atmosphere affect each other can be more intriguing than terrestrial data. \"For a geologist, Venus is such a great planet because you have geology and you have the atmosphere and they're interacting with each other in a really interesting way without the mess of the biosphere,\" Stofan said. \"It's kind of like a pure planet, which for a geologist is really fun.\"But while Earth's biosphere may be intellectually annoying, we're all awfully fond of it, and that's a powerful reason to care about climates on other worlds. \"It's no longer just a luxury because we're curious,\" Grinspoon said. \"It's become an essential survival tool for us now.\"Climate scientists are the first to tell you they want more data, more models, more to dig their teeth into. Some types of climate information does go back millennia, like the details trapped in  that scientists can pull from the ocean floor, but climate data is skewed heavily toward . []So doubling the number of planets you're looking at \u2014 even with limited data \u2014 makes a difference. \"[Venus is] a laboratory for understanding  on an Earth-like planet,\" Grinspoon said. \"You can't learn everything you need to know about climate change on Earth by only studying Earth.\"And unlike , the same interactions on Venus don't have the kind of emotional drama attached to them. That means that Venus doesn't just offer new information \u2014 it also offers a new way of talking about climate, even with those who have taken an ideological stand against findings here on Earth.\"I've had some conversations with people in that camp that have been fruitful because I've used the example of Venus,\" Grinspoon said. \"It allows you to sort of reframe the question \u2014 you're not just talking about policy choices on Earth. \u2026 It's not a cure-all for that difficult conversation, but I do think it can help.\"Whatever humans do or do not choose to do about Earth's climate, someday countless years from now, as the , our world will travel the same path as Venus, with the oceans evaporating away into a runaway greenhouse world. By then, climate won't be a problem for any of us, but it's still a poignant reminder of what science can tell us about the world.\"I'm not saying, 'Oh, that's about to happen to Earth,'\" Grinspoon said. \"But the overall lesson still stands that climate stability is not something you can take for granted.\"", "headline": "Can Venus teach us to take climate change seriously?", "article_name": "can-venus-teach-us-to-take-climate-change-seriously", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/can-venus-teach-us-to-take-climate-change-seriously", "date_published": "2018-12-03 00:00:00", "article_length": 5214, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:20.341874"}

{"id": null, "body": "MARK LEVIN, HOST: Hello, America. I'm Mark Levin. This is \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" Welcome.PATRICK MICHAELS, SENIOR FELLOW IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AT THE CATO INSTITUTE: Nice to see you.LEVIN: It's a great honor to see you, Patrick Michaels, doctor. Expert on all things climate and environment, as far as I'm concerned. A little bit of your background. You're the Director of the Center for Study of Science at the Cato Institute. You hold an AB and SM, you hold those degrees in Biology, Sciences and Plant Ecology from the University of Chicago - pretty good school. PhD in Ecological Climatology from the University of Wisconsin in Madison, 1979. You're past President of the American Association of State Climatologists. You were Program Chairman for the Committee on Applied Climatology at the American Meteorological Society. Say that fast five times.MICHAELS: Yes.LEVIN: You were a Research Professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia for 30 years, and I'm giving an extensive background that you have. I'm giving that to the public so they that you know you really know what you're talking about. You're a contributing author and a reviewer of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.All right, let's get started. Climate change, global warming, global cooling - we've heard it all. What's going on out there?MICHAELS: Well, surface temperature of the planet is warmer than it was a hundred years ago about 9/10th of a degree Celsius.LEVIN: Nine-tenth degree of a degree Celsius.MICHAELS: That's all.LEVIN: Is that a lot?MICHAELS: No. It's not a lot. There are two periods of warning, one in the early 20th Century that could not have been caused by human beings because we hadn't put enough CO2 in the air, and one in the later part of the 20th Century that either slows down or ends depending upon whose data you use somewhere in the late 1990s, only to resume with the big El Nino that covered the news the last couple of years.So that means that probably about half, maybe half of that nine-tenths of the degree might be caused by greenhouse gases because when the planet warmed beginning in 1976, the temperature of the stratosphere started to drop and that's the prediction of greenhouse theory that's not intuitive. The great philosopher of science Karl Popper said, if you can meet a difficult prediction with your theory, you can continue to entertain your theory.So the theory is right, but the application of it is wrong. It is nowhere near as warm as it's supposed to be. The computer models are making systematic, dramatic errors over the entire tropics which is 40 percent of the earth, and it's where all our moisture comes from or almost all of it.LEVIN: Let me stop you there. Who does these computer models?MICHAELS: Governments. There are 32 families of computer models that are used by the United Nations, each government sponsored. And all of them are predicting far, far too much warming.The disparity between what's been predicted to happen, which looks like and what is happening continues to grow.LEVIN: We know that for a fact?MICHAELS: Yes, because you could just look at the weather balloon temperatures. You can look at the satellite temperatures. You can look at something called the reanalysis data. They all behave in concert. So they're showing the same thing, and the same thing is a lot different than this thing. However, we need to call the special counsel.LEVIN: A special counsel?MICHAELS: Yes, because one model works and you know what it is? It's the Russian model.LEVIN: So let me get this straight. So all the government models are like this?MICHAELS: Yes.LEVIN: The Russian model like this.MICHAELS: Yes, the Russian model has the least warming in it.LEVIN: And the Russian model has the least warming and the Russia model, pretty much follows reality that's been tested over a few decades.MICHAELS: Yes, correct. If we were rational about this, think about the daily weather forecast. You watch the Weather Channel, they go, \"Oh, this model says that, that model says that. We think this one is working the best, so we're going to rely on that.\" Well, for climate forecast, we should be using the Russian model, but we're not. We use this big spate of all the other models that have this warming in them that's not occurring.LEVIN: Why are all of these other government models, 31 of them, wrong? And why do they all go in the same direction, up?MICHAELS: Because, they are what are is called parameterized. They're all parameterized, can I translate parameterized into English? Fudged. They don't get the right answer, don't know the right answer for a certain phenomena, so we essentially put in code steps that give us what we think it should be. And the systematic error that was made was the models were tuned, yes, I said, tuned.Tuned to simulate the warming of the early 20th Century. It began in 1910, ended in 1945, about 0.45 degrees Celsius. Mark, that could not have been caused by carbon dioxide.LEVIN: Because there wasn't enough.MICHAELS: That we had to put enough in that the background carbon dioxide concentration is 280 parts per million. When the first warming started, it was 298 parts per million. If the atmosphere is that sensitive to an 18ppm change in CO2, we wouldn't be talking about this right now and we'd be sweating bullets.LEVIN: So what you're saying is man-made carbon dioxide earlier, in the last century could not have produced ...MICHAELS: The early 20th Century.LEVIN: The early 20th Century could not have produced this heat. So what did? Do we know?MICHAELS: No. And you know, the three most important words in life may not be \"I love you,\" It might be, \"I don't know.\" I don't think anybody really knows what kicked off that warming. There's lots of theories. One is that it was the final escape from a cold period, a multicentury period known as the Little Ice Age. That's a plausibility, but why did it happen then?But we just don't really have a good explanation for that, but because we forced the computer models to say, \"Aha, human influence, CO2 and other stuff.\" We made the models too sensitive, and so that's why when you get to the late 20th Century, all of a sudden they're warming up like crazy and the reality is down here. It was guaranteed to happen.This was revealed in \"Science\" magazine in late 2016, and there was a paper that was published by a French climate modeler called \"The Art and Science of Climate Model Tuning,\" and in it, he speaks of parameterizing -- we could say fudging -- the models to give, his words, an anticipated acceptable range of results.So it's the scientist, not the science that's determining how much it's going to warm. A lot of people don't know this, but it happens to be true, and you know, we could speculate as to why that paper was published right before the 2016 election? I wouldn't want to impute causation, but gee, if ...LEVIN: But I want to ask you about causation.MICHAELS: Sure.LEVIN: You have you 31 governments.MICHAELS: The 31 different models.LEVIN: All right, 31 different models. They are multiple governments.MICHAELS: Right.LEVIN: They're fudging the numbers?MICHAELS: Not fudging them, they are parameterizing.LEVIN: Okay, well, you used the word fudging. Does our EPA do that? Does NASA do that? Who does that for us?MICHAELS: Aha, good question, Mark, because the EPA was told by the Supreme Court in 2007 that if it found the carbon dioxide endangered human health and welfare, that it had the power to regulate it under the Clean Air Act.LEVIN: This is the Massachusetts.MICHAELS: That's the Mass EPA. Well, they produced an endangerment finding, 2009, and the endangerment finding for its prospective climate is 100 percent, I didn't say 90 percent, I said 100 percent based on those models. So if you can demonstrate that those models systematically are not working, you can take down the endangerment finding, and that would be the basis for all those policies that came out of the Obama administration.LEVIN: Which would mean you don't get to regulate ...MICHAELS: Absolutely.LEVIN: ... carbon dioxide.MICHAELS: Absolutely, the endangerment finding is the heart of the matter. And to give you an idea how gung-ho the Obama administration was on this issue. If you listen to his first inaugural speech, January 20, 2009. The second substantive paragraph of the speech is about global warming, after health care. Ninety days after he finished that speech, his EPA produced a preliminary finding of endangerment from carbon dioxide.They were working on this before he was President, bureaucrats can't work that fast, and then the final finding was made in December for the climate conference in Copenhagen that was supposed to produce another global warming.LEVIN: So you're telling us that we have a massive bit of public policy that has enormous effect on society that's built on - I'll use my words, phony models.MICHAELS: It's built on a house of cards. The models really don't work. And if I could really be arcane, I could explain the mechanism as to why they don't work.LEVIN: As long as I understand it.MICHAELS: The models systematically predict that as you go up in the atmosphere in the tropics which are 40% of the earth that the temperature should rise dramatically as you go further up in the atmosphere. So when you get to the level of the jet stream, the computer models are predicting seven times. I didn't say seven-tenths of a degree, I said seven times more warming than is being observed.But why is that important? Why am I boring you with that? Because the vertical distribution of temperature that determines upward motion, which means, it determines precipitation, and guess what? Almost all the atmospheric moisture that we have around us today in the humid Washington, DC, that comes from the tropics. So if you get that vertical motion wrong, down there, you get all the subsequent variables wrong. It's a fantastic systematic error, and again, that along with the difference between the surface temperatures or rather the lower atmospheric temperatures and what's being observed, that's sufficient to kill the endangerment finding.LEVIN: Okay, so to the average pedestrian like me, if you get that wrong, what does it mean? You get all the weather models wrong?MICHAELS: You get the subsequent weather wrong. That's why, if you look at all these families of models, they predict radically different changes in precipitation from model to model. Well, probably because they got the precipitation initialization out of tropics wrong.Precipitation is important. I offer you Wilmington, North Carolina as an example of precipitation. It's important coming from the tropics, get that wrong and you get that wrong.LEVIN: Is weather getting worse?MICHAELS: No. I love that question because what you really want to look at and Roger Pielke, Jr., at the University of Colorado does this. Yes, there's more damage from weather because there's more stuff and people and property in the way of weather. So what you really want to look at are weather damages as a percent of GDP.When you look at it that way, there's nothing whatsoever. I'm sure hurricanes are getting worse. I heard that on every legacy network during Florence and Harvey and all that stuff. Well, fact of the matter is, there's a guy by the name of Ryan Maui who is just a hot shot young tropical meteorologist. He is also an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and he tracks the energy in these tropical cyclones.Since we got global records that began in 1970, and you would think there would be some relationship between that integrated energy and global warming after all, it's only logical. Vice President Gore says that must be the case. It's not. There's no relationship whatsoever between the accumulated cyclone energy and the surface temperature of the earth. It's just not thereNow, what - wait a minute, why does our government say this? They said it in their last report called \"Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States.\" They said, \"oh, there's been a significant increase in hurricane power in the Atlantic Ocean from like 1970 to 2009,\" or something like that, 1980 to 2009. Wait a minute. Why did you stop in 2009? It's a 2014 report. Because if you take the data after 2009, the increase goes away and back to where it was.Why did you start in the mid 1970s, because we have records that are really good back in 1920 and if you look at 1920 to 1950, you see an increase that is exactly the same as the one that occurred ...LEVIN: So the information they're providing us ...MICHAELS: It's skewed.LEVIN: It's skewed.MICHAELS: It's skewed. They're cherry picking.LEVIN: And here, we rely on the climatologists, meteorologists, and they become hyper political and I want to get back to that ...MICHAELS:L Absolutely.LEVIN: ... as soon as we return. Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, you can watch Levin TV almost every week night by going to crtv.com/mark, crtv.com/mark and sign up there or give us a call at 844-LEVIN TV, 844- LEVIN TV. We'll be right back.Dr. Patrick Michaels. The politicization of science. Let me read you something from Ayn Rand, \"Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution,\" a book of hers she wrote, which I found rather compelling. She said, \"Instead of their old promises, that collectivism would create universal abundance and their denunciations of capitalism for creating poverty. They are now denouncing capitalism for creating abundance. Instead of promising conflict, comfort and security for everyone, they are denouncing people for being comfortable and secure. The demand to restrict technology is the demand to restrict man's mind. It is nature, that is reality that makes both these goals impossible to achieve. Technology can be destroyed and the mind can be paralyzed, but neither can be restricted. Whether and whatever such restrictions are attempted, it is the mind, not the state, that withers away.\" You agree with that?MICHAELS: Yes, I do. Now, we should ask the question, how did it happen? How did we use the authority of government to direct essentially technology, energy, et cetera? How did government become so intrusive in the science process? And to do that, we have to know history. It goes back to none other than Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, at the end of World War II, saw that the Manhattan Project was going to be successful, probably.And he wrote to the director of the office that ran the project and said, \"Hey, we need to keep all these scientists working for the government. They'll do great things and everybody will have a greater life,\" and that produced a document called \"Science: The Endless Frontier,\" by Vannevar Bush which laid the blueprint for the Federal takeover of Science, prior to World War II. There was very, very little Federal money in Science except in the land grant schools, and scientific progress was perfectly fine.Economic growth, we were the envy of the world. If science is involved in developing economies, and I believe it is, we were doing really, really well. Now, when the government takes it over, the government gets what it wants and the government can give out money to basically only study the global warming via climate models. Did not take a look at climate history and to see what that really tells us, and then the government can have the policies that it wants. Because, do you expect, do you really expect scientists who have been paid for decades to study the effects of warming and to create models that by the way have too much warming, do you expect them to testify in front of Congress when asked do we need more research? They would say no, it's really a non-problem? They'd get thrown out of their jobs if they did that.And so it becomes self-perpetuating. Now global warming is a cosm, it's not a microcosm. It's a pretty big cosm -- cosmos -- in this constellation, but there are other issues that the government just abuses science onto take people's stuff, if you don't mind, and that governments distort in service of a political end.I mean, think about the dietary advice that we've been getting from the government for 20 or 30 years, turns out to be wrong. Might be associated with the epidemic of obesity and diabetes. These - when the government gets together and makes a plan and does not deviate from it, people get hurt, and that is what's happening, and Ayn Rand was right. Part of the plan was to get us off our energy stream, to get us off of oil and onto so- called renewables, renewables that don't provide nearly enough energy, and it's intermittent so that they take down the technology.What Ayn Rand was talking about is what actually happened. As a result of Roosevelt and Vannevar Bush, we created the State Science Institute. And if you remember in \"Atlas Shrugged,\" it was the State Science Institute that destroyed the innovation of the society.LEVIN: So I have an interesting paradox here, which is that you have an institution of government or several of them, which claim to be the final say in science by rejecting science, by attacking aspects of science, by climate change deniers.MICHAELS: By shading it.LEVIN: By shading it, so you actually lose knowledge, you lose science, correct?MICHAELS: Yes, that's a problem. If you say, well, they're just studying the greenhouse effect and the greenhouse effect is real and it will create some warming, so all these things, all these pronouncements that we get on diet, on whether we should exploit the world's largest copper deposit in Alaska, what the government says will have a small kernel of truth in it, and then it will be built into an artifice the size of Mount Everest from that small kernel, and that's the problem.LEVIN: I don't mean to simplify this, but who are these people? Are they ubiquitous? Are there ten of them?MICHAELS: When you buy off the academy, you can get what you paid for, and you know, when we went into the federalization of science, the academy said, \"Okay, we'll apply for your money and we're going to tack on 50% for every research application that we're going to call overhead, and that money, we, the universities, will use as we choose, and so a lot of it that the engineering and science departments generate all this revenue, probably goes to keep the dramatic language of the department to flow which does not have enough student traffic.\"So now, the academy roots for anything that is big government that it feels it can tie onto to maintain this relationship. The roots of political correctness, there are many, manifold and varied. But one of them certainly was the enslavement of the academy.LEVIN: This is a very important point, because you're not the first one I've talked to who has mentioned this and there are different fields. So the academy -- the universities and colleges -- more and more less in terms of pure science, less in terms of pure knowledge, less in terms of pure debate and so forth, more and more directional, more and more ideological. That's your point?MICHAELS: Yes, it is, and it's not just in climate change. In fact, I am just completing a book manuscript that looks more than climate change, it looks at diet, it looks at drug policy, the opioid war and all these good things. It's called \"Scientocracy,\" and I think that's what we have developed in this country.And you know, there are things we can do about it, but this has to be a public will, and the public is so scientifically misinformed that it becomes a very, very heavy lift, doesn't it.LEVIN: One fact, it becomes very political, doesn't it? In other words if you don't believe in climate change and you can't even explain it, you don't know what it means, you don't know where it comes from, you don't know why it exists, but you know as a political matter, you better believe in it or you're a denier like a holocaust denier.MICHAELS: Right.LEVIN: We'll be right back.LAUREN GREEN, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Lauren Green. New images show the last time \"Washington Post\" columnist Jamal Khashoggi was seen alive. Pictures from Turkish state television show him entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month. The Saudis have now admitted he is dead saying he was killed in a brawl inside the consulate. Turkish media also reporting that Khashoggi's fiancee is now under police protection. The report however did not elaborate why.An investigation is under way after a floor collapsed during a party at a clubhouse near Clemson University in South Carolina. The floor caved as people were dancing injuring some 30 people as they fell into the basement below. Some were treated in hospitals but none of the victims received life-threatening injuries. I'm Lauren Green, now back to \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\"LEVIN: Dr. Michaels, everybody says this global warming, it's a terrible thing. The oceans are going to rise, we just talked about this. The hurricanes are going to be more intense and so forth, and you're saying not really. Well, we never talk about this, are there benefits from some increased heat on the planet?MICHAELS: Yes, the whole philosophy here is straight out of Voltaire. You know, Pangloss and the best of all possible worlds, we don't live in the best of all possible climates. And our atmosphere is not in the best of all possible composition. So what's happened as it's warmed this half a degree in the late 20th Century and the CO2 has gone up and up in the atmosphere, well, what we've done is we've created a greener and greener planet and the greening of the planet earth is profound. There's a very recent paper that just came out a couple of months ago, showing tremendous increases in how much green matter there is on the planet.LEVIN: Vegetation.MICHAELS: Vegetation. The largest increases by the way are in the tropical rainforest. It's growing like topsy.LEVIN: Is that why we never hear about it anymore?MICHAELS: I don't know why we don't hear about it anymore, but it sure is growing, and in grassland, which is lot of it is used for agriculture either ...LEVIN: Prairies.MICHAELS: Prairies that cows either go on or we harvest it for hay, the data for 17 years of satellite data show the grassland, green mass, if you will, is growing at 5% per year. That's huge. Another paper, \"Nature\" magazine by Ziaxen Ju (ph) two years ago looked at the planetary greening and said what are the causes? He did something called a factor analysis. Seventy percent of it was a simple direct effect of putting more carbon dioxide in the air because it's plant food. And one of the other big causes of the planetary greening was climate change, the warming of the planet. Yes, we never hear about this, but it's real.LEVIN: So even though it's warming just a little bit, it has an enormous positive impact on the planet.MICHAELS: Because the main reason for that is because the way the greenhouse changes work is they warm the coldest temperatures preferentially to warming the warmer ones, so the growing season, which ends with the first frost in autumn and begins with the last frost in the spring, the growing seasons get longer and longer and longer, the greenhouse effect also affects nighttime temperatures more than it affects daytime temperatures, that's when the cold temperatures are.So you have a longer time for the planet to green up and then you have longer growing seasons and you have the direct fertilization of carbon dioxide which is even more important than the climate change itself, and you're winding up with a much greener planet. I've looked at these numbers. I can tell you that the amount of agricultural productivity that is now being induced in the planet by CO2 particularly in these grassland areas is going to provide a lot of our food for our future.LEVIN: You know, it gets a little confusing frankly, the politics and the logic of all this, that is, you would think if a tiny little bit of increase in heat and it comes and goes, right? I mean, that's the way the nature works, that's how the planet functions, would be so beneficial, that we wouldn't be trying to regulate the hell out of it, we would pretty much just leave it alone.MICHAELS: Well, you would think, but unfortunately, like we talked about early in the program, if we parameterize the models to produce large amounts of heat in the 21st Century, then we're going to say it's all bad and we're going to try to, if you will, de-technologize.LEVIN: When did all this start? When did all of this propaganda, the fake stuff ...MICHAELS: When it all started? I'll tell you when it started. It started in the late 1970s when a group of folks that I know decided that they wanted nuclear power, and they decided that Carter, who sold himself as a nuclear engineer, he was actually a technician on a submarine, that Carter was favorable to this, so that if they pushed the issue of global warming as a catastrophe, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, that could lead to the nuclearization of the country.That's when it started, and it spun out of control because the green allies who wanted us, the fossil fuel thing gone, they didn't want nuclear power. They're dramatically opposed to nuclear power. So they pushed solar energy and windmills. Now we get an unreliable grid and expensive electricity. It actually has a history. It happened. It was an international movement that started out in Sweden with Bert Bolin who was the first head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and it was a very conscious plan to impose this not just on our society but the world.LEVIN: What is this de-growth, de-industrialization movement? Is it sort of part of this massive progressive movement or even worse, socialism or Marxism or anything of that sort. I've studied, I've written about it, I've read about it, it's really kind of got born in Europe and was exported to the United States?MICHAELS: That is true, and the problem with it is that it enjoys broad support as long as you demonize the producers of energy. We should celebrate the producers of energy. It is energy that drives the technology that has doubled our life expectancy in the last 100 years. We should be celebrating this. And if you take this away, you're going to take that away too.LEVIN: Don't forget, folks, almost every week night, you can you join me on Levin TV, Levin TV, go to crtv.com/mark, crtv.com/mark or give us a call at 844-LEVIN-TV. 844-LEVIN-TV. We'll be right back.At the top of the show, we went through your biography a little bit, and you worked for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at the UN. I don't know a lot about it, know a little about it, written a little about it, but it was sort notoriously corrupt intellectually as I understood it, tell us about that.MICHAELS: Well, the IPCC as it's called is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The United Nations is trying to tell you something there, it wants the governments of the world to have a unified view, and therefore a unified policy on climate change. That's what it was there for.Now, I was asked to write a small portion of second report. I've reviewed the other ones and people said, \"Why did you work for IPCC?\" Well, fact of the matter is that all garden parties need a skunk. And there were a few skunks there. The skunks eventually kind of dropped out because they tend to get so disgusted with it. But we got our two cents in and then, as you know, it's simply kind of run away with the issue, and all these documents that are produced like the IPCC documents, the US national assessment on climate change, they're summaries of scientific literature.Now, the problem is the scientific literature, itself, has to be biased, because we are working, we are funding the hypothesis that climate change is this horrible thing. It has all of these horrible effects and you don't get your grant renewed unless you publish and so that literature that you summarize is biased in a given direction. That's how we get on policy did. Did some people sit in a room and say, wow, this is how we'll do this? I don't know. But it might have happened.LEVIN: The UN is notoriously anti-capitalism and high sovereignty, national sovereignty and so forth. Naomi Wolf once said, a leftist activist, obviously, that really, it's the environment, climate change, all these issues, through which we're going to change the capitalist society.MICHAELS: Correct.LEVIN: Is that what's taking place?MICHAELS: They're trying. They certainly had a block in the road that occurred, a bump in the road that occurred a couple of years ago.LEVIN: What happened?MICHAELS: Well, we got a President that wasn't going for it, and he promised to get out of the Paris Accord on Climate Change, that's an agreement that was hatched in December of 2015, in which the nations of the world submit what are called voluntary plans to reduce their emissions. So, for example, we volunteered to reduce our emissions at pretty substantial percentage. The Indians volunteered to increase their emissions, the Chinese volunteered to increase their emissions until 2030 whereupon they might level off.So the president looked at that and he says, this is a bad deal. What I just told you, doesn't that sound like a bad deal?LEVIN: Yes .MICHAELS: And he got out of it. Meanwhile, what country on earth reduced its emissions the most? Of all the nations on earth? The US of A.LEVIN: So this would have formalized an agreement where we're compelled to lower and the Chinese and the Indians could increase?MICHAELS: Yes. Now, the thing - but nobody is compelled. There's no enforcement mechanism in the Paris Accord. So when our negotiator, John Kerry came back and was on the Sunday TV shows, he said, well how are you going to enforce this? What are you going to do countries that don't do what they said they were going to do? He said, \"We'll shame them.\" Honest to God, I guess we have a shame bomb now and that's going to do something. Of course, emissions are going up.LEVIN: Why have we lowered our?MICHAELS: We have lowered ours largely because of good old capitalism and technology, discovering that we were not running out of natural gas, that if we just break rocks underneath our feet, we can extract the natural gas from shale.LEVIN: Fracking.MICHAELS: Fracking, that's right. And so we're substituting natural gas which is cheaper for coal for electrical generation, and that produces about half as much CO2 per unit electricity as a coal plant does, and so our emissions are going down, and I see a lot of big companies are experimenting with natural gas for large scale transportation. You can do to on a railroad because the size of the engine doesn't matter. It might be able to do it in trucks, so the emissions, it's more efficient, the emissions go down and then 30 or 40 years from now, because there are so many pressures to be efficient, I don't know what technology we will have, but I'll bet it will be more efficient. The old advertising slogans, the future belongs to the efficient, well, welcome to the United States.LEVIN: We'll be right back.Dr. Patrick Michaels, why does the media do such a lousy job in reporting basic information like you're explaining to us right now?MICHAELS: Well, the end of the world sells, look at the ratings for the Weather Channel every time there is even a modest hurricane, and if you are predicting and projecting global weather and climate Armageddon, people are going to tune in, and even if it doesn't happen, the way it's supposed to, well, you don't have to report that, do you? You don't have to report that the climate models are predicting way too much tropical warming and all that good stuff. No, you can just keep on going as you will. There's a niche, though, I've often thought of this. Wouldn't there be a market for a good weather channel that just had pictures of the beach and bright sunny days with advertisers Anheuser-Busch and Viagra, it would work, I'm sure.LEVIN: There's an opening right there.MICHAELS: Yes.LEVIN: But it's a great disservice, I see this across the board in a lot of cultural, social, scientific issues, where the free press doesn't provide information. Doesn't provide facts. It provides ideologically pushed policies. And this is particularly troublesome to me in this area because there's a lot of correcting that needs to be done, so it's politicized. It becomes an ideological movement. We talk about people want to raise objections to it. You. You've come under a barrage of assaults as I've seen.MICHAELS: It's not very pretty.LEVIN: Not very pretty, simply because you say wait a minute, I have different information that shows something else. What's it like?MICHAELS: It's not fun, but it must be enough fun that I continue to keep on doing it. The problem is that a lot of the journalistic profession, a lot of people go into it because they're idealistic, they want to change the world, and my God, here's an issue that affects the energy structure of our society, which really affects our society and I can be involved in this? So they form pressure groups or internal lobbying groups like the Society of Environmental Journalists.LEVIN: I didn't know there was one?MICHAELS: Oh, yeah, they're very powerful within the profession, and enforces a speech line. There are certain things you don't say, there are certain things you say. And they have annual conferences where the lights of issues like climate change come and give them lectures about the end of the world. So it's a self-feeding process and it's an institution.LEVIN: Is the EPA a good agency or a bad agency? When you hear about it, you say, well, clean air, clean water, saves the polar bears, but do they fear, over regulate and make progress that much more difficult?MICHAELS: The polar bears are saving themselves. They're growing in numbers. The EPA was the outgrowth of the early environmental movement in the United States. It was created by Richard Nixon, and by the way, the air in some of our air sheds was crap.LEVIN: By the way, we're going to finish with this when we come back. We'll be right back.The EPA started under Nixon, what are your thoughts about?MICHAELS: We had a lot of work to do when it started out. We had really serious air quality problems in the country and the EPA did a great job with that. It tried - it succeeded in controlling sulfur and nitrogen oxides that came out of power plants, acid rain and all that good stuff. But unfortunately, like most bureaucracies, one of the easy low hanging fruit are the things you get and then you start to get more arcane, but your bureaucracy is embedded and then the agency takes on a life of its own and that's what has happened. Can it be fixed? Yes, it could be. We could take a look at the endangerment finding from carbon dioxide and see how scientifically well supported or non-supported it is. I think that would go a long way.And then, we would have a much more sensible policy. We would not be shooting ourselves in the energy foot like we are and we would continue to maintain our society at higher level.LEVIN: True enough. Problem is when you have people who are embedded in these agencies who are not willing to do as you say or ideologically driven, or are there for decades and have, as you say, their agenda - and they are going to drive their agenda, this becomes a huge problem. Let me tell you, it's been a great pleasure.MICHAELS: Yes, it was great fun.LEVIN: All right, thanks very much.

{"id": null, "body": "\n        In this June 3 photo, Sen. Barbara Boxer speaks at a construction site near the Caldecott Tunnel in Orinda, Calif. (AP Photo) Terrorism. Nuclear weapons. Corrupt and oppressive regimes.Sen.  said last week that climate change -- not any of that other stuff -- will stand as the \"leading cause of conflict\" over the next two decades. The comment was apparently based on reports and studies over the past few years that have linked climate change to other security issues, but her colleagues -- as well as her Senate campaign opponent -- described the prediction as a big stretch.Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., Boxer's Republican counterpart on the environment committee she chairs and arguably the most outspoken global warming skeptic in Congress, decried the warning on Tuesday as a bogus ploy to win support for a sweeping energy regulation bill.\"We know global warming alarmists frequently use scare tactics to push the U.S. to pass costly cap-and-trade legislation. But to say that carbon emissions will be the leading cause of conflict in the next 20 years represents a new low in alarmist propaganda,\" Inhofe, ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a written statement to FoxNews.com.\"Given the tremendous security challenges confronting our nation today -- from , , Islamic extremism and much else -- Senator Boxer's statement seems a bit out of touch. I would hope that she simply misspoke.\"The chairwoman of the EPW committee made the remark on the floor last Thursday, when the Senate was taking up a challenge to the Obama administration's EPA rules that would cut greenhouse gas emissions. Democrats succeeded in stopping the Republican-led resolution, with the help of senators like Boxer.On the floor, she warned that climate change would have far-reaching consequences in the not-so-distant future.\"I'm going to put in the record ... a host of quotes from our national security experts who tell us that carbon pollution leading to climate change will be over the next 20 years the leading cause of conflict, putting our troops in harm's way,\" Boxer said. \"And that's why we have so many returning veterans who want us to move forward and address this issue.\"According to Boxer's office, the senator believes climate change will be \"one of the\" leading causes of conflict -- not necessarily the primary cause -- despite her statement on the floor last Thursday. It's unclear whether Boxer simply misspoke or whether she was intentionally escalating her warning.Boxer's office backed up her statement afterward by pointing to a Pentagon report that discussed the security implications of climate change; the creation by the CIA of a Center on Climate Change and National Security; and a statement from 33 retired generals and other high-ranking military officials saying climate change is \"making the world a more dangerous place.\"But the recent studies and statements on the connection between climate change and other problems generally do not conclude that the issue will drive all-out chaos on a global scale.Rather, they say climate change has the potential to exacerbate existing problems like poverty and droughts and social tensions.That was the conclusion reached by a National Intelligence Assessment in 2008 that found climate change could lead to food and water shortages, among other problems, and in turn fuel conflict.\"Climate change alone is unlikely to trigger state failure in any state out to 2030, but the impacts will worsen existing problems,\" then-National Intelligence Council Chairman Thomas Fingar said in a statement to Congress. Fingar said the problems would hit poor, developing countries hardest leading to pressure on the U.S. military to respond, but that the  might actually \"benefit slightly\" from climate change over the next few decades because of \"increased agricultural yields.\"The Pentagon's latest Quadrennial Defense Review also concluded that climate change would contribute to \"food and water scarcity\" and could worsen \"mass migration.\" The report said that \"climate change alone does not cause conflict,\" though it \"may act as an accelerant\" of instability.Even that conclusion has been called into question by experts who say the theory lets bad governments and bad leaders off the hook by blaming future problems on climate.Idean Salehyan, a University of North Texas professor who co-authored a book on this subject, wrote a column in 2007, when the theory started to gain traction, in which he called predictions of \"apocalyptic\" consequences from climate change \"misleading\" and \"irresponsible.\"\"They shift liability for wars and human rights abuses away from oppressive, corrupt governments,\" he wrote. Salehyan could not be reached for comment for this article.The Heritage Foundation's James Carafano testified last year before Boxer's committee that political violence has actually dropped as emissions have risen.\"The environment does not cause wars -- it is how humans respond to their environment that causes conflicts. Climate change does not necessarily ensure that there will be more or less conflict,\" he said.The campaign of Boxer's Republican opponent, , cited Carafano's testimony and others in criticizing the senator's claim from last week.\"We can all agree that terrorists pose a serious security threat to our nation. However, there is wide disagreement within the security community, and the American people, about the role climate change plays in global security. Despite this, Barbara Boxer has chosen to fight for cap-and-trade legislation under the auspices that somehow raising energy prices and costing America jobs will make us safer,\" Fiorina spokeswoman Amy Thoma said in a written statement to FoxNews.com.Robert Dillon, spokesman for EPW committee member Sen. , R-Alaska, said Boxer was \"overstating\" the problem. He said Democrats have been employing a lot of \"hype\" to try building support for the stalled cap-and-trade energy bill. Murkowski sponsored the EPA challenge that was defeated last week.\"I think we all understand that climate change adds to those issues [detailed in the studies],\" Dillon said. \"What made Senator Boxer make that leap? ...

The third of that series is set for Sept. 12 and potentially Sept. 13 if enough candidates qualify.Perez has argued that he wants the broadest audiences possible to see Democratic candidates discuss a wide range of issues. His aides also note that the party has received separate requests for single-issue debates on civil rights, guns, poverty and issues affecting older Americans.Additionally, the party has barred its candidates from attending any non-DNC sponsored debate, which the chairman defines as candidates interacting on the same stage at the same time.However, the party's Resolution Committee on Thursday did adopt a statement that encourages candidates to participate in unofficial \"multicandidate\" forums with candidates on the same stage. That could, however, meet Perez's definition of a \"debate,\" and thus run afoul of existing rules barring candidates from such events not sanctioned by the party.\n      Washington Gov.

In an embarrassing blunder, dozens of Sunrise Movement protesters\u00a0recently staged a sit-in protest at what they believed to be a Pennsylvania Democratic Party office lobby\u00a0to demand the party organize such a debate.Police arrested 11 individuals, and it later emerged there was no Democratic Party office there. The environmentalists said they had received bad information.\"If you can't figure out where the local Democratic Party offices are before you show up for the protest, I'm not sure that I trust your analysis of the climate science much less what to actually do about the problem,\" Ted Nordhaus, founder and executive director of\u00a0, told Reuters.Nevertheless, despite all the setbacks, on\u00a0Thursday\u00a0the group sounded a note of optimism, and vowed to continue to push for that goal.\"This partial victory shows the strength of the grassroots movement and the power of young people,\"\u00a0said Sunrise Movement spokesperson Sofie Karasek.\u00a0\"In the coming days and months, we'll keep fighting to make sure the DNC and Tom Perez treat the climate crisis like the emergency that it is, and give it the airtime and attention it deserves.\"However, political headwinds appeared to be running against the environmental activists.

{"id": null, "body": "\n        SONY DSC At  in Matakohe, , biologist Dr. Jonathan Palmer explains a novel approach to assessing global climate change - by analyzing the rings of ancient kauri trees.This work, published in the February 5th 2012 edition of the science journal  online, represents one more dimension of planetary climate assessment, and is already making a contribution to our understanding of how Earth\u2019s climate has altered over the years.The article, , was written by a Dr. Anthony Fowler, and a team of scientists, including Palmer. \u00a0The term ENSO refers to El Nino/Southern Oscillation, a phenomenon of temperature change that shifts and changes on a global scale over time.At one time, vast forests of kauri () covered much of northern New \u00a0Zealand. The majestic trees with immense crowns are unique to the northern island of New Zealand, and are now regarded as biological treasures. But over the past several centuries, both Maori natives and colonial settlers have burned down, cut down, or otherwise greatly reduced the population of kauri trees to approximately 3% of their former density. Today the few remaining ancient kauri trees are protected by environmental agencies, and are tourist attractions, much like the redwoods of California.The kauri is a hardwood tree, and grows to a huge proportion. Some kauri trees have measured as much as fifty feet or more in diameter, yielding hundreds of tons of timber each. Especially in the 1800s and early 1900s, cutting down kauri trees for ship-building, home construction, and post wood was a big industry in New Zealand. Some kauri trees grow for more than 1,500 years each, and as a result represent a biological storage space of information about climate history. Even more, many ancient kauri trees, dating as far back as 30,000 years, have been found well-preserved in swamps, enabling scientists to analyze climate history going back tens of thousands of years.Scientists have known for a long time that tree rings indicate annual growth cycles. The width, color and composition of tree rings reveal information about environmental conditions, including temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. By analyzing samples of wood from the cores of ancient kauri trees, scientists have been able to establish certain cycles of global temperature, including very hot periods and very cold periods. With this information they have generated a climatic graph that covers several thousand years.Today the issue of global climate change is a hot topic, and the key question is whether or not human activity is making a significant difference in global warming. According to the assessment of kauri rings presented in the  article, global temperature has risen at different periods over millennia. It also appears that in the twentieth century, significant warming of global climate has occurred. Evidence of this has been recorded by temperature measure with thermometers since their invention, and reaching back into longer history with ice-core drilling.At the Kauri Museum, immense sections of kauri, as well as extensive photography of the former kauri timber industry, are on display. The photographic records available show vast forests that fed a hungry timber industry until most of the trees were gone and the industry collapsed. Today Jonathan Palmer is working on a project to help repopulate kauri trees, and to establish a sustainable kauri timber industry. But he\u2019s just getting started.Global climate impacts human health, wildlife, and all biological assets including food crops. Rising temperatures affect weather, and are altering life on a planetary scale. And it has branched into the realm of politics, becoming a very hot button issue. \u00a0But a variety of scientific measures spanning long periods of time can shed light on global climate in a manner that political arguments cannot.It may be that the assessment of kauri rings from ancient trees will help to clarify what remains a confusing and hotly disputed issue that affects us all.Hot PlantsTales from the Medicine TrailKava: Medicine Hunting in ParadiseThe Whole Food BiblePsyche DelicaciesThe Five TibetansScrew Business as Usual", "headline": "Kauri trees hold secrets to climate change", "article_name": "kauri-trees-hold-secrets-to-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/kauri-trees-hold-secrets-to-climate-change", "date_published": "2015-10-27 00:00:00", "article_length": 4165, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:25.761598"}

Canuto) Earth is changing faster than anyone can comprehend. Every day, more\u00a0, more\u00a0\u00a0and more evidence of the world's ancient cultures slips away. Change of some kind is, of course, inevitable \u2014 but it is happening more quickly and more severely because of the effects of human-caused\u00a0. And that has some scientists worried: The quicker Earth changes,the less time there is to learn from its past and understand its mysteries.Recently, two researchers proposed a way to preserve a record of our planet in its present state: use lasers to create a high-resolution, 3D map of the entire world. It's now the mission of a new nonprofit project called\u00a0, which is spearheaded by archaeologist Chris Fisher and geographer Steve Leisz, both of Colorado State University.\"The climate crisis threatens to destroy our cultural and ecological patrimony within decades,\" Fisher said earlier this year in a\u00a0. \"How can we document everything before it's too late?\"The answer, Fisher said, is light detection and ranging, or lidar \u2014 a method of remote scanning that uses aircraft to shower a landscape with a dense net of laser beams. From this bombardment of light, researchers can create high-resolution, 3D maps of a given area and then digitally edit out foliage and other features that might be concealing hard-to-spot secrets near Earth's surface.The technique has become more prominent in archaeological surveys in the past decade, helping researchers uncover lost cities in heavily forested parts of\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0,\u00a0\u00a0in ancient Rome and previously undiscovered\u00a0. In 2007, Fisher was part of a team that used lidar to uncover traces of a lost metropolis in the Honduran rainforest. These scans, Fisher said in his TEDx talk, revealed more details about the city's ruins in 10 minutes than he and his colleagues could have found in 10 years of research on the ground.The experience convinced Fisher that scientists need to \"scan, scan, scan\" to capture the world's most vulnerable places before they disappear. The Earth Archive's efforts would focus on scanning the planet's entire land area, which encompasses about 29% of the planet's surface, beginning with the most threatened regions, such as the Amazon rainforest and coastal regions at risk of being washed away by rising sea levels. The project would likely take decades, Fisher said, but the resulting snapshot of Earth would be \"the ultimate gift to future generations.\"Doing this, of course, will require lots of funding; the project needs about $10 million just to scan most of the Amazon within the next three years, Fisher\u00a0. That price tag has some other researchers worried about The Earth Archive's tenability. Mat Disney, a professor in the University College London Department of Geography, told The Guardian that such a project would inevitably draw funding away from other research projects. Even with proper funding, he added, getting permission to fly a research aircraft over restricted airspaces would prove to be a logistical hurdle.\"Who is going to give them permission to fly over Brazil? The Brazilian government aren't,\" Disney said, referring to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s ongoing efforts to\u00a0\u00a0and open parts of the protected rainforest to commercial interests.To learn more about the project or to donate, visit\u00a0.", "headline": "Scientists want to make a 3D map of the entire world before climate change ruins it", "article_name": "scientists-want-to-make-a-3d-map-of-the-entire-world-before-climate-change-ruins-it", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/scientists-want-to-make-a-3d-map-of-the-entire-world-before-climate-change-ruins-it", "date_published": "2019-10-16 00:00:00", "article_length": 3600, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:26.859286"}

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., alongside\u00a0Reps. Garret Graves, R-La., and Bruce Westerman R-Ark. McCarthy held a caucus event on climate change Thursday, and appears to be taking action that counters critics who believe the GOP is not concerned with environmental issues.\"If you look at this conference today, we just had a whole event talking about the environment, not because someone is driving us but because we care about it,\" he told Axios.The proposed policies\u00a0reportedly focus on three particular efforts. The first is the capturing of carbon dioxide emissions. Part of this includes what is being called the Trillion Trees Act, whereby legislation would look to increase the number of trees in the U.S., with the goal of using them for \"sequestering\" carbon. The congressmen are also looking to expand tax credits for companies that capture and store carbon dioxide.The plan does not include emissions targets that are favored by Democrats. Graves claimed that setting \"arbitrary targets\" would be \"a mistake.\"The second part of the plan is the promotion of clean energy technology by doubling investment in clean air research and lowering taxes for companies that export clean air tech. Nuclear power and natural gas are also featured in the plan.The third area of focus is conservation, especially when it comes to plastic. This includes cleaning up pollution from plastic, urging government labs to develop improved recycling methods, and directing foreign aid to nations whose rivers suffer the most from plastic pollution.The Green New Deal, pushed by lawmakers including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., takes a more far-reaching approach, with Sanders  a \"wholesale transformation of our society\" in which transportation and the economy are overhauled.", "headline": "GOP looks to counter Green New Deal with three-pronged climate change plan: report", "article_name": "gop-looks-to-counter-green-new-deal-with-climate-change-proposals", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-looks-to-counter-green-new-deal-with-climate-change-proposals", "date_published": "2020-01-21 00:00:00", "article_length": 2119, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:27.520824"}

And some victims and analysts have bemoaned calls to address climate changes as secondary to fixing what they consider to be a broken system.\u201cClimate change has brought bountiful rains throughout most of the past two decades, which have suppressed wildfires and allowed for more vegetation growth. That is a good thing,\u201d said James Taylor, Director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center for Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute. \u201cHowever, Australian government policies that discourage or prohibit prescribed burns and other proactive land management have meant that when we finally have a dry year, there is more fuel for the fires, less management of the vegetation that fuels the fires, and a greater chance of wildfires burning out of control.\u201d\n      Kylie Jenner posted this photo to her Instagram story in order to draw awareness to the Australian wildfires.\n      Baxter asserted that it was clear to him that \u201cclimate has an impact on the current situation.\u201d\u201cRegardless of the reasons for climate change, we all know from the facts that the climate is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have longer, hotter, and drier fire seasons. The winters are shorter, meaning that the hazard reduction or 'prescribed burning\u2019 is much shorter, and we have less days to get the required burning done.\u201dPrescribed or hazard reduction burning refers to deliberate, monitored fires conducted during off-seasons, aimed at clearing out flammable materials from precarious terrain. It is regulated and administered by agencies at a state level, such as park authorities or environmental bodies. Eucalyptus trees, an Australian bushland staple, are also known to be especially flammable.A woman in Australia rescued a badly burned and wailing koala from a bushfire on Tuesday. The marsupial was taken to a local veterinarian and is expected to make a full recovery.The likes of Collen Jackson, a 46-year-old farmer in the town of Benembra,\u00a0see \u201cenvironmentalists\u201d as problematic catalysts in obstructing hazard reduction.\u201cThe traditional owners of this land have used circle burn techniques for thousands of years to control the build-up of hazardous material \u2013 leaf matter, bark, fallen dead wood, low bushy trees. These circle burns allowed animals to escape the fire and, at the same time, cleaned up the forest floor to remove fuel for a wildfire,\u201d she said. \u201cThis type of burning has been refused by the government due to environmentalist pressure.\u201dFrom Jackson\u2019s lens, this has allowed \u201calmost 30 years of fuel buildup on the forest floor\u201d and thus \u201chas made these fires uncontrollable by increasing the heat of the fires one thousandfold.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like any fire, the less wood you add to it, the less it burns. Lightning strikes would still have ignited a fire due to dryness, but if there was no fuel on the forest floor, then the fires would not have been so ferocious,\u201d she continued.\n      A firefighter manages a controlled burn to help contain a larger fire near Falls Creek, Australia, Sunday, Jan. 5, 2020.

Australia is currently the world\u2019s largest coal exporter, which is troubling, particularly as we see governments across the world phasing out coal and financial institutions also starting to back away from financing coal,\u201d said Julie Anne Miranda-Brobeck, communications manager for Global Witness, an NGO that endeavors to exposes natural resource corruption and human rights abuses worldwide. \u201cCoal is simply not economically viable.\u201dConservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison has pledged to \u201caddress issues around hazard reduction for national parks, dealing with land clearing laws, zoning laws and planning laws around people\u2019s properties and where they can be built.\u201dHe has also underscored that there were \u201cmany contributing factors\u201d to the mammoth blazes, including the ongoing drought and fuel loads.

The cost of the damage is expected to exceed $3 billion.Arson, too, has played its part.Police in New South Wales this week announced that, since the beginning of November, , while 53 others have been accused of failing to comply with total fire ban regulations. A further 47 people have had legal action taken against them for dumping a burning cigarette or match on arid land.In Queensland, law enforcement has apprehended some 101 people for igniting blazes \u2013 69 teenagers and 32 adults \u2013 and in Victoria, some 43 have reportedly been charged.Scientists insist that climate change has acerbated already ripe conditions for calamitous fires, while critics have contended that such devastation is nothing new to the Australian landscape.\n      New South Wales, Australia, January 2020: Berrara during the bushfire emergency in January 2020. Extreme temperatures, dry conditions and winds have combined to cause or escalate hundreds of bushfires across five Australian states, in an unprecedented fire season.\u00a0\n      In 2009, the infamously-named Black Fires took the lives of 173 people, and more than 2000 homes were destroyed. In 1974, some 290 million acres of land were decimated by flames across Australia\u2019s interior. The fire season of 1966 brought with it 62 lives lost at 7000 rendered homeless as over 4000 buildings burned, and dating back to the 1800\u2019s documentation from a single fire season highlights that 640,000 acres burned, 12 people died, and thousands of dwellings charred to the ground.\u201cThis is not Australia\u2019s hottest year. Nor is it Australia\u2019s driest year.\u00a0 Bushfires are a common occurrence there, going back a long time,\u201d argued Steve Milloy, publisher of JunkScience.com. \u201cThe 1939 bushfires, for example, were much worse.\u00a0 The most important reason for the bushfires is poor land management practices.\u00a0 We know that because the Aborigines have cut their fires by 50 percent because of controlled burns, as even the New York Times has reported.\u201dBut for those most impacted by the combustion \u2013 some described shooting their animals, their faces awash with tears \u2013 skepticism remains that it will never really be over.\u201cThe fires are still burning and will be for months. I am sitting right in the middle of the impact zone. I know my farm will be burned, I just don\u2019t know when,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe government won\u2019t be here, and they told us that three weeks ago \u2013 we are on our own.

While the tensions between the two began to thaw during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, both Trump and Newsom have recently renewed their attacks on each other as the outbreak of the deadly virus looks far from being contained. \u201cI see again, the forest fires are starting. They\u2019re starting again in California,\u201d Trump said Thursday at a campaign event in Old Forge, Pa. \u201cAnd I said, you\u2019ve got to clean your floors.

{"id": null, "body": " on Tuesday released a 547-page blueprint on how to combat climate change, in which they called for \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d to be put at the heart of environmental and climate change policy in the coming years.\u201cEnvironmental justice must be at the center of federal climate and environmental policy,\u201d the massive outline, presented by the Democrats on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, says.In a glossary of the multitude of terms used in the , Democrats define \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d as\u00a0\u201cthe fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, culture, national origin\u00a0or income, with respect to the development, implementation\u00a0and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations\u00a0and policies to ensure that each person enjoys (1) the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards; and (2) equal access to any federal agency action on environmental justice issues in order to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn, work, and recreate.\u201dThe plan marks an attempt to outline the party\u2019s strategy on climate change\u00a0and distinguish it somewhat from the \u00a0(GND) -- an expansive far-left, multitrillion-dollar\u00a0proposal championed by Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.The plan is somewhat less ambitious than the GND, calling for a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, while the Green New Deal calls for the elimination of emissions by 2030. Similarly to the Green New Deal, it calls for regulations on everything from infrastructure to updated building codes to increase energy efficiency.The new plan would also mandate that no new car emit greenhouse gases from 2035 on, with heavy trucks to follow in 2040. Democrats say it would save more than 60,000 lives and $8 trillion because of benefits related to both health and climate.\"Democrats know the climate crisis is the essential crisis of our time, threatening public health, jobs and the economy, national security and values,'' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said at a press conference.Calls for radical action to combat climate change dominated the Democratic agenda in 2019, but have been swept to the aside amid the coronavirus crisis and recent national debates about race and police brutality in the wake of the death of .There is a nod to Floyd in the document, which mentions him on the first page. There are also regular references to the question of race and how it intersects with the issue of climate.The document speaks a number of times as well about \u201cenvironmental justice communities\u201d which it defines as a community \u201cwith significant representation of communities of color, low-income communities, or tribal and Indigenous communities, that experiences or is at risk of experiencing higher or more adverse human health or environmental effects.\u201dThe many aspects of the plan would likely pass in the Democratic-controlled House but would largely be dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate. But it\u2019s a plan that is setting out what the Democratic agenda would look like should Democrats win the Senate and the White House in November.Republicans dismissed it as a version of the Green New Deal, with the White House accusing Democrats of pushing \u201cradical Green New Deal-like policies that would cripple America\u2019s economy and crush the poorest communities across the globe.\u201dRepublicans on the panel had expressed anger that they had been excluded as Democrats released a partisan report.\u201cIf I had known then what I know now, why did we go through this whole waste of money by putting a committee together, wasting money on staff, and do a dog and pony show with hearings? Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., told . \u201cYou don\u2019t need us to do this. You certainly didn't need to spend taxpayer funds to do it.\u201dConservative groups also strongly opposed the blueprint. Myron Ebell, the\u00a0director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute,\u00a0called\u00a0it a \"ridiculously wasteful plan.\"\u201cHouse Democrats claim there is a climate crisis that demands immediate action, yet their Select Committee on the Climate Crisis has dilly-dallied for over a year to produce a list of shopworn proposals that would benefit special interests at the expense of consumers and taxpayers,\" he said.The plan is similar to that proposed by presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. His campaign praised the plan, which also has the backing of a number of environmental activist groups.But the radical Sunrise Movement, which has long championed the Green New Deal, said it didn\u2019t go far enough.\"This plan is more ambitious than anything we have seen from Democratic leadership so far, but it still needs to go further to match the full scale of the crisis,'' said Lauren Maunus, the group's legislative manager.Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, with a focus on immigration.

{"id": null, "body": "A look at new data fueling debateIn the climate change debate, believers and skeptics alike have vastly different opinions based on widely divergent facts.That was illustrated by Wednesday's release of \"Climate Change Reconsidered II,\" a study by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change,\u00a0which draws its conclusions from thousands of peer-reviewed papers, and which finds global warming to be an entirely manageable, if not beneficial, change in the climate.The report stands in stark contrast\u00a0 to the U.N.'s\u00a0 latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report\u00a0 of March 31,\u00a0which predicts \"severe impacts\"\u00a0 from climate change, but which was toned down from earlier IPCC reports that predicted an array of global catastrophes resulting from the proliferation of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.The IPCC reports have, through the years, stood as the unassailable foundation for the Obama administration regulatory policy on global warming. \"The debate is settled. Climate change is a fact,\" Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union Address.\"The dirty little secret \u00a0is , we are now at 17 years and 8 months of no global warming,\" says Roger Pilon, Vice President\u00a0 for Legal Affairs at the Cato Institute. \"Their models have failed year in and year out, \" he says of the scientists who comprise the 97 percent consensus the administration frequently cites.The NIPCC report\u00a0 finds:-- That warming from greenhouse gases will be so small as to be indiscernible from natural variability.-- The impact of modestly rising CO2 levels on plants, animals and humans has been mostly positive.-- The costs of trying to limit emissions vastly exceed the benefits.The NIPCC report was immediately assailed by administration supporters. The website Media Matters reported that the NIPCC study was published by the conservative Heartland Institute, which previously denied the science demonstrating the dangers of tobacco and secondhand smoke. (In fact, Heartland's denial\u00a0 of the\u00a0 dangers of second hand smoke was re-affirmed by a large scale 2013 study\u00a0 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute which found \"no statistically significant relationship between lung cancer and exposure to passive smoke.\")Yet, the administration\u00a0and its supporters seem unbowed\u00a0 by any contrary findings of the dangers of global warming. Just this week, in testimony\u00a0 before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\u00a0 Secretary of State John Kerry said of global warming, \"All of the predictions of the scientists are not just being met, they're being exceeded.\"Speaking in Portland, Oregon Tuesday night, former secretary of state and potential Democratic presidential candidate,Hillary Clinton said to vigorous applause, \"Climate change is a national security problem, not just an environmental problem.\"Skeptics believe those statements are demonstrably false. They point to observable data, not computer modeling, to prove their point. \"Carbon dioxide does not cause weather to become more extreme, is not causing polar ice and sea ice to melt, is not causing sea level rises to accelerate,\" Joseph Bast of the Heartland Institute said at a Washington event\u00a0 in which the NIPCC report was released.All of this is leading Congressional doubters to further question an array\u00a0of\u00a0 EPA regulations the president has unleashed to maneuver around Congressional resistance to cap and trade and other carbon-mitigating legislation.In a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing Wednesday, Senator Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska,\u00a0 told EPA Administrator\u00a0Gina McCarthy, \"The sheer number of proposed rule makings, coupled with cost of compliance with the vast array of regulations already on the books...is very, very frustrating.\"Longtime climate change skeptic Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., introduced legislation last week that would tackle the administration's regulatory end-run around Congress. It would prevent the EPA from issuing any final rule until it conducts an economic analysis as required under the Clean Air Act.", "headline": "Deepening divide over climate change sparks fierce debate", "article_name": "deepening-divide-over-climate-change-sparks-fierce-debate", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/deepening-divide-over-climate-change-sparks-fierce-debate", "date_published": "2015-12-20 00:00:00", "article_length": 4011, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:33.053097"}

If you listen to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the California mayors of San Francisco, Oakland, Richmond and others, the entire blame rests exclusively with our oil and natural gas industry. Conveniently, these money-hungry mayors and their equally greedy trial lawyers accuse only the largest, most profitable oil and natural gas companies of wrongdoing.Their municipal lawsuits allege that global warming is a local, \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d issue and the sole perpetrators of our planet\u2019s \u201cwarming\u201d are no farther away than the local refinery or natural gas plant. Sound unfair? Add this insane reasoning to the fact that dozens of other industrialized nations are apparently blameless for any of the planet\u2019s climate-related woes. Operators of airlines, asphalt factories, cement plants, auto dealerships and heavy machinery in New York or California are likewise off the hook for any climate change-related issues.These lefty mayors suggest that because the earth\u2019s climate is changing, they might incur expenses years down the road for possible sea level rise, storms, etc., so they want our oil and natural gas producers to pay hundreds of billions in undefined damages.A U.S. district judge in California scheduled a hearing to listen to both sides of the debate in a \u201ctutorial\u201d on climate change. While the energy industry presented logical facts, trial lawyers representing these liberal metropolises offered a tried-and-failed retread of legal\u00a0claptrap.\u00a0Importantly, the judge dismissed the notion of a conspiracy by energy companies to suppress global warming science.\u00a0 Referring to one of the documents he reviewed, the judge said, \u201cI read that paragraph 67 the same way; that there was a conspiratorial document within the defendants about how they knew good and well that global warming was right around the corner.\u00a0 And I said: \u2018Okay. That's going to be a big thing. I want to see it.\u2019 Well, it turned out it wasn't quite that.\u201dIn 2011, six Midwest power companies faced the same legal nonsense. The cases were tossed by the U.S Supreme Court, with liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing the majority opinion in the 8-to-0 decision.A few years ago, several liberal state attorneys general attempted to sue Exxon for alleged damages associated with climate change, attracting fawning praise from the liberal press. But headlines often fall short of actual facts in court and in every claim, the state AG\u2019s quietly retreated from their cases or let them fall inactive.\u00a0 In 2011, six Midwest power companies faced the same legal nonsense. The cases were tossed by the U.S Supreme Court. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in the 8-to-0 decision which ruled that American corporations cannot be sued under local \u201cnuisance\u201d ordinances regarding greenhouse gas emissions as the climate change issue falls under the jurisdiction of Congress and the EPA, which, according to Ginsburg, are \u201cbetter equipped to do the job than individual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case decisions.\u201d Ginsburg warned that turning the jurisdiction of climate change over to local courts would create a quagmire of dissenting legal opinions across the country and allow an individual district judge to become a \u201csuper EPA.\u201dThe truth is America should embrace its energy industry and halt these unfounded efforts to sabotage our vital energy sector. The surge of American shale oil and natural gas production has fundamentally improved the U.S. economy and led the way in lowering CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases.In 2005, after the nation\u2019s shale drilling revolution began, C02 emissions began to fall. U.S. energy-related carbon emissions fell 14 percent below the 2005 level in 2016, according to the U.S.\u00a0\u00a0(EIA). It wasn\u2019t\u00a0due to renewable fuels that still represent less than 5 percent of our national energy grid. Our nation\u2019s drop in C02 emissions came as our manufacturing and energy sectors began a decisive shift toward natural gas. The market\u2019s move to relatively clean-burning natural gas has been so profound that even if Barack Obama had never decreed the Clean Power Plan, the United States would have \u00a0already met the CPP\u2019s carbon dioxide reduction target for 2025, according to a recent\u00a0Our U.S. oil and gas industry has invested\u00a0\u00a0on emission control technologies between 2000 to 2014, according to a\u00a0. Just between 2013 and 2014 alone, the industry\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 equal to taking 11.8 million cars off of the road. Methane emissions from venting and flaring associated with onshore petroleum production declined 40 percent just between 2015 and 2016, according to a\u00a0. The five biggest energy companies -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., BP Plc and Total SA -- collectively curbed combined emissions an average of 13 percent between 2010 and 2015, according to a\u00a0.These city officials should face securities fraud charges because they\u2019ve been caught telling bond investors how any risks associated with climate change in their cities are hardly measurable, while in court they argue how the sky is falling. Sadly, this matter will likely have to go back to the Supreme Court after the left leaning 9th\u00a0Circuit Court of Appeals surprised no one by allowing these state-by-state cases to advance.In the meantime, our energy producers will have to fend off more groundless charges as they work to provide affordable, reliable energy for us all.

{"id": null, "body": "Three of the four installments of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which claims to show the state of the global climate system under stress, are now available.All three show things are seriously amiss \u2013 although not necessarily with the climate itself. The final installment, to be published in September will further underline the need to reform the IPCC.The IPCC has three working groups, each producing its own report. Working Group I, focusing on climate change itself, released its findings last September. Compared to the previous report, of 2007, it quietly revised downwards its estimate of eventual global warming.[pullquote]The IPCC became less pessimistic about climate change, although its press release would not tell you so.The report also illustrates just how outmoded the IPCC has become since it was founded in 1988. Its reports are written over a period of three years, and finished months before publication.When preparations started on AR5, the world hadn\u2019t warmed for 13 years. That is a bit odd, if you believe the models, but not odd enough to merit a lot of attention.By the time the report was finished, however, it hadn\u2019t warmed for 17 years. That is decidedly odd, but hard to accommodate in a near-final draft that has been through three rounds of review.After the report was finalized, but before it was published, a number of papers appeared with hypotheses about the pause in warming. AR5 was out of date before it was released.The IPCC model \u2013 every six years a big splash of climate analysis \u2013 is broken.Working Group 2, published in March, and focusing on the impacts of climate change, had a different problem. It lies at the heart of the previous IPCC controversy.\u00a0The scientific literature now acknowledges that many of the more worrying impacts of climate change are in fact symptoms of social mismanagement and underdevelopment.The first rule of climate policy should be: do no harm to economic growth. But the IPCC was asked to focus on the risks of climate change alone, and those who volunteered to be its authors eagerly obliged.\u00a0There is even a groundbreaking section on emerging risks.The first paper on an issue is always dramatic. That is the only way to get something onto the scientific agenda. Follow-up papers then pooh-pooh the initial drama. But the IPCC chose not to wait for those follow-up papers.IPCC reports are often two to three thousand pages long, but there are two or three main findings only.Authors who want to see their long hours of IPCC work recognized should thus present their impact as worse than the next one.It was this inbuilt alarmism that made me step down from the team that drafted the Summary for Policy Makers of Working Group 2. And indeed, the report was greeted by the four horsemen of the apocalypse: famine, pestilence, war, death all made headlines.April\u2019s Working Group 3 had yet another problem. Its focus, climate policy, is a hot political debate in many countries.The Summary for Policy Makers is drafted by academics, but approved line-by-line by government representatives. Every clause that could possibly be used against a government position, either in a domestic debate or in international negotiations, was neutered or removed.But the authors are at fault, too. A little bit of emission reduction costs little. But as targets get more stringent, costs escalate. Not so according to the IPCC: Very ambitious targets are said to be only slightly more expensive than less ambitious targets.This surprising finding is a statistical fluke. Emission reduction is easy according to some studies, which duly explore very ambitious targets.Emission reduction is hard according to other studies; very ambitious targets are prohibitively expensive and results not reported.The surprisingly low cost of meeting very stringent emission reduction targets is the result of selection bias.Oddly, the IPCC made the same mistake in the previous report.The final part of the AR5 report, the Synthesis, will be published in September. It will fail to offer policy makers what they need to know: a systematic comparison of the costs of climate policy to its benefits, the avoided impacts of climate change.Compared to the most famous cost-benefit analysis of them all, the Stern Review, published in 2006, the IPCC finds that the impacts of climate change are lower and the impacts of climate policy higher. But the IPCC will not suggest that the emission reduction targets recommended by Stern \u2013 global emissions 25 percent below 2005 levels by 2050; stabilize warming at 2-3\u02daC \u2013 are, perhaps, too stringent.Given its flaws, should the IPCC be disbanded? That would be pointless. Climate change is a problem of the future. Climate policy responds to forecasts of the future rather than measurements of the past.There are large climate bureaucracies around the world, who exist by virtue of climate science. If you abolish the IPCC, the climatocracy will create a new IPCC. The IPCC should therefore be reformed.Here are some suggestions:Away with the infrequent, massive set pieces.\u00a0Away with alarmism \u2013 that has been tried for 25 years, with no discernible impact on emissions. Away with activists posing as scientists.\u00a0Away with the freshman mistakes.Just good, sober, solid science.\u00a0Let the chips fall where they may.", "headline": "UN climate change expert reveals bias in global warming report", "article_name": "un-climate-change-expert-reveals-bias-in-global-warming-report", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/un-climate-change-expert-reveals-bias-in-global-warming-report", "date_published": "2015-05-07 00:00:00", "article_length": 5372, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:37.990875"}

{"id": null, "body": "Here are 10 things to know about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.N.-sponsored scientific group that will present a landmark report on global warming Friday.___WHAT IS THE IPCC?A scientific body with 195 member countries, the panel was established by the U.N. in 1988 to assess the causes and impacts of climate change. Since then, it has released four assessments, each stating the human link to global warming with more certainty than the previous one. The IPCC doesn't conduct its own research, but appoints hundreds of experts to review and summarize the latest scientific studies on climate change. More than 800 scientists contributed to a report set to be released Friday.___WHAT REPORT?The IPCC is meeting in Stockholm this week to adopt the first of four parts of its fifth assessment report on climate change. This part deals with the physical science basis of global warming. A summary for policy-makers of about 30 pages will be published Friday, and the full 2,000-page report on Monday. Next year, the IPCC will present sections assessing the impact of climate change and strategies to fight it. A synthesis of the three reports will be adopted in October 2014.___SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE IPCC DOING IN STOCKHOLM?Delegates from member countries are meeting behind closed doors with authors of the physical science report to hammer out the summary for policy-makers. They are going through a draft line by line, which can be a frustratingly slow process because the text needs to be approved by consensus. Governments may have problems with the text being either too complex or too vague, or they may have non-scientific concerns about grammar or word choice. Commenting on a June draft, the U.S. wanted it to read more like a narrative. Underscoring the politics involved, China wanted to remove national borders from a world map used in the draft to \"avoid unnecessary disputes.\"___WHAT ARE THE ASSESSMENTS USED FOR?They form the scientific basis for U.N. negotiations aimed at curbing global warming. The fifth assessment report will be a reference point for governments as they negotiate a new global climate agreement, which is supposed to be adopted by 2015 and to take effect in 2020.___WHAT DO CRITICS SAY ABOUT THE IPCC?Some scientists say the IPCC process is so time-consuming and laborious that by the time the assessments are published they are already out of date. Policy-makers sometimes complain that the language in the reports is too scientific and difficult for non-scientists to understand. A series of errors embarrassed the authors of the 2007 assessment, including the incorrect statement that the glaciers in the Himalayas would disappear by 2035. Climate skeptics seized on those errors as evidence the IPCC process is flawed. Supporters say the fact that such errors are so rare shows how solid the process is. There has also been criticism about the IPCC's lack of openness.___WHAT WILL THE NEW REPORT SAY?The final version will be adopted Friday, so changes are still possible, but leaked drafts suggest the IPCC will say it's \"extremely likely\" that climate change is man-made. That would be an upgrade from \"very likely\" in the 2007 report and would mean that scientists are now 95 percent certain of man-made warming. The report is also expected to raise the projections of sea level rise this century and analyze the human contributions to the loss of Arctic sea ice, which hit a new record in summer last year, and the retreat of glaciers and ice sheets. The June draft projected that surface temperatures will rise by 0.3-4.8 degrees C (0.5-8.6 F) this century, depending in part on whether and how much countries reduce their CO2 emissions.___HOW ACCURATE ARE THE IPCC'S PROJECTIONS?The IPCC makes long-term projections about how the climate system will respond to warming temperatures over the next decades so we won't know just how accurate they are until the evidence is in at the end of this century. Scientists generally agree that the assessments offer the best available estimates of future warming, and the projections are based on a solid understanding of the factors at play in the climate system. But they also stress that there are uncertainties involved, just like knowledge about financial markets doesn't mean you will be able to predict the stock market.___WHAT DOES THE IPCC SAY ABOUT THE RECENT 'HIATUS' IN WARMING?When climate scientists talk about global warming they refer to the rise in global temperatures observed in the past 100 years or so. They typically don't pay much attention to shorter time scales in which temperatures can go up or down in natural climate fluctuations. But there's been so much media attention recently to a purported slowdown in the temperature rise in the past 15 years that many governments want the IPCC to address it in the report. Some skeptics claim this \"hiatus\" shows that global warming has stopped, even though if you compare decadal averages, the previous decade was the warmest on record. It's an area that needs more research, but many scientists say the purported slowdown reflects random climate fluctuations and an unusually hot year, 1998, picked as a starting point for charting temperatures. Another leading hypothesis is that heat is settling temporarily in the oceans.___WHO HEADS THE IPCC?Rajendra Pachauri, a scientist from India, has been the chairman of the IPCC since 2002. He is set to step down when his term expires in 2015.___WHERE IS THE IPCC BASED?The secretariat of the IPCC is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, in the offices of the World Meteorological Organization, the U.N.'s weather agency.", "headline": "10 things to know about the UN-sponsored panel on climate change, the IPCC", "article_name": "10-things-to-know-about-the-un-sponsored-panel-on-climate-change-the-ipcc", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/10-things-to-know-about-the-un-sponsored-panel-on-climate-change-the-ipcc", "date_published": "2015-01-13 00:00:00", "article_length": 5648, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:39.622082"}

{"id": null, "body": "\n        Sunset on Bali August 13, 2003 Climate alarmism has become the chant of the media and liberals who favor more government regulations. As Chairman of the House Science Committee, I have challenged the alarmist rhetoric and pursued the facts about climate change.The Committee follows the scientific method, which welcomes critiques, avoids exaggerated predictions, and relies on unbiased data. Unfortunately, alarmists ignore all these principles.Those of us who subscribe to the scientific method by questioning assertions are wrongly labeled \u201cclimate denier.\u201d So much for welcoming critiques.While I have never denied that the climate is changing, I have asked tough questions about how much the climate has changed and how much of an impact humans have had on the climate. Furthermore, I have supported technological innovation, rather than costly federal regulations and mandates, as the solution to a changing climate.On the other hand, climatologist Dr. Stephen Schneider has said, \u201c\u2026we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.\u201d His message is clear: never express doubt and never accept any critiques. And the Los Angeles Times refuses to publish opinion pieces from anyone the paper deems a \u201cdenier.\u201d The paper should present both sides of controversial issues, not just their side.Climate alarmists seek to silence those whose research raises doubts. Instead of claiming that \u201cthe science is settled,\u201d alarmists should welcome new research that furthers the science of climate change.Instead of claiming that \u201cthe science is settled,\u201d alarmists should welcome new research that furthers the science of climate change.Alarmists also violate the second tenant of the scientific method, avoiding exaggerated predictions.Since the late 1970s, climate scientists have told the American people that global temperatures would increase more than one degree Celsius by 2020. However, actual satellite temperature observations do not support these predictions. Observed temperatures were less than half as high as the climate models\u2019 predictions. When the predictions are so far off, we should not make policy decisions based on them. Much more research into the complexity of changing temperatures is needed.Furthermore, the idea that anyone can make precise predictions of what kind of climate will exist 85 or more years from now is laughable. There is simply no way to take into consideration climate variables or technological breakthroughs.Commenting on the recent hurricanes, many climate scientists have tried to link these storms and climate change. But the historical record disproves them. Hurricane landfalls in the United States since 1900 are on a steady decline. The cost of damages from these storms, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is also shrinking. Even the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has affirmed that they have \u201clow confidence\u201d in climate change contributing to extreme weather.Examination of patterns of other extreme weather events in the United States shows that a changing climate does not increase the frequency of these events. For example, U.S. wildland fires are decreasing in frequency. The number of recorded fires in recent years is nearly one-fourth the number of fires observed in the 1970s. Climate alarmists just won\u2019t let the facts get in the way of their science fiction.The third tenant of the scientific method, reliance on unbiased data, is violated by climate alarmists who present the American people with suspect data to advance a political agenda.For example, some claim that the Paris Climate Accord will reduce global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius. They have barraged the American people with this falsehood to garner support for the deal. But MIT data shows that the agreement would decrease warming only 0.16 degree Celsius by 2100 \u2013 over 80 years from now \u2013 and only if all 195 countries completely abided by the agreement.While I am sure that the alarmists will continue to shout fire when there is none, I believe the American people will call their bluff and insist that the scientific method be followed. The way to address climate change is not by increasing regulations and taxes. The future lies with research and development. Forget the alarmists\u2019 hysteria and look to technology and innovation to solve climate change challenges.", "headline": "Rep.

Dismayed by what they see as a lack of progress on the implementation of climate policies that they support, these 20 scientists sent a calling for their political opponents to be investigated by the government.In particular, they are voicing their support of a  (D-R.I.) for a RICO investigation of fossil fuel corporations and their supporters, who the scientists allege have deceived the American people about the risks of climate change, with the consequence of forestalling America\u2019s response to reducing carbon emissions.RICO, short for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, is a federal law enacted in 1970 as a crime-fighting tool for use against the Mafia. It includes prison sentences of up to 20 years and seizure of financial assets for those found guilty of \u00a0such \u201cracketeering.\u201dWhat these 20 scientists have done with their letter is the worst kind of irresponsible advocacy. Attempts by powerful people to silence other scientists, especially in this brutal fashion, is a recipe for stifling scientific progress and for making poor policies.Senator Whitehouse singled out one climate scientist, , a solar physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who argues that changes in solar radiation, rather than carbon emissions, are the major force behind global warming.Seven other climate scientists were the targets of a recent  (D-Ariz.). I was one of the seven. Rep. Grijalva indicated that I was investigated because of my recent Congressional testimony summarizing peer-reviewed research indicating that the magnitude and impacts of expected warming could be less than generally believed.None of the Grijalva 7 was found to have engaged in wrongdoing of any sort, yet there have been  for some.The demand by Senator Whitehouse and the 20 climate scientists for legal persecution of people whose research on science and policy they disagree with represents a new low in the politicization of science.The role of these 20 scientists is particularly troubling.\u00a0 The consequence of this persecution, intended or not, is to make pariahs of scientists who are doing exactly what we expect of researchers: to critically evaluate evidence and publish that work in the scientific literature.Minority perspectives have an important and respected role to play in advancing science, as a mean for testing ideas and pushing the knowledge frontier forward. While President Obama bows to no one in , he recently made an important in a town hall meeting at the University in Iowa on the importance of challenging received knowledge in a university setting:\"Because there was this space where you could interact with people who didn\u2019t agree with you and had different backgrounds from you \u2026 I started testing my own assumptions, and sometimes I changed my mind,\" he said. \"Sometimes I realized, maybe I\u2019ve been too narrow-minded; maybe I didn\u2019t take this into account; maybe I should see this person\u2019s perspective. That\u2019s what college, in part, is all about.\"That\u2019s even more what real science is about. It is important for scientists to engage the public and to work with policy makers to assess the impacts and unintended consequences of policy options. However, it has become \u2018fashionable\u2019 for academic scientists to advocate for certain political outcomes, without having much understanding of the policy process, economics, or the ethics of such advocacy.What these 20 scientists have done with their letter is\u00a0the worst kind of irresponsible advocacy. Attempts by powerful people to silence other scientists, especially in this brutal fashion, is a recipe for stifling scientific progress and for making poor policies.Climate policy has been limited by an overly narrow set of narratives and policy options. Expanding the frameworks for thinking about climate change and climate policy can lead to developing a wider choice of options in addressing the risks from it.That is how democracy is supposed to work. We search for solutions that can garner a critical mass of support. We don\u2019t try to criminalize our political opponents, and especially should not try to criminalize scientists who have a different view.", "headline": "A new low in science: Criminalizing climate change skeptics", "article_name": "a-new-low-in-science-criminalizing-climate-change-skeptics", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/a-new-low-in-science-criminalizing-climate-change-skeptics", "date_published": "2017-01-12 00:00:00", "article_length": 4421, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:42.400629"}

But for a few days each year, the leaders of small island nations share a podium with presidents and prime ministers from the world's most powerful nations, and their message is clear: Global warming is already changing our lives, and it will change yours too.Speaking shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 whose fiery speech made no mention of climate change \u2014 Danny Faure told the U.N. General Assembly this week that for his country, the Seychelles, it's already a daily reality.\"We see its effects in our eroding coastlines and unpredictable weather patterns,\" he said. \"We see its effects on our coral reefs and rising sea levels.\"The Indian Ocean nation off the east coast of Africa is one of dozens of Small Island Developing States \u2014 or SIDS for short \u2014 that have been trying to draw attention to what they see as the overarching threat of our time.\"Decades ago, small island developing states warned the world of the risks of climate change, and those were once theoretical threats,\" said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands a sprawling series of atolls in the Pacific Ocean thousands of miles north of Australia.The message may finally be getting through, in part due to the devastating wildfires, storms and floods that have affected millions of people in the developed world over the past months.\"The extreme weather events lately have underscored to leaders elsewhere that this will affect their populations, too, in the here and now,\" said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, who has followed international climate negotiations for many years.The realization may help push leaders to commit to greater action to rein in climate change ahead of a year-end deadline that countries have set themselves to flesh out the 2015 Paris climate accord, Meyer said. But he warned that there remains a big gap between the rhetoric on climate change, and the willingness of leaders of major economies like Germany or Japan to take decisive actions, such as stop burning fossil fuels.Despite its minuscule carbon emissions, Heine said her nation wants to show it, too, is prepared to do its part. The country is aiming to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, a goal most climate experts consider an absolute deadline if the world is to avert runaway warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.Marshall Islanders know the future of their country, much of which is little over a meter (3.3 feet) above sea level, hangs in the balance. A recent report predicted that the world's oceans will rise by an average of at least 2 feet (61 centimeters) by the end of the century compared to now. Experts say the actions of the United States, which Trump announced will pull out of the Paris agreement, could play a decisive role in the future of small islands.Some officials warn that islanders may have to abandon their homes long before they sink beneath the waves, as the cost of rebuilding after every storm surge becomes too great.\"Last year, the passage of the storms Olga and Maria meant for our country the destruction of infrastructure built for a billion dollars,\" said Danilo Medina, president of the Dominican Republic. \"Imagine what that means for a country in which the annual budget of the state is already limited.\"Medina said his Caribbean country backs calls for an international fund to compensate poor nations for the loss and damage caused by climate change.\"This fund will help protect the valuable lives of millions of human beings, bring peace of mind to their homes, allow them to have a future without the permanent uncertainty of feeling threatened every time they see the rain coming.\"His words were echoed Thursday by Haiti's President Jovenel Moise, who urged rich countries to stick to their pledges under the Paris accord, which includes include financial aid for vulnerable nations to adapt to and mitigate the impact of climate change.New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, told a meeting of government and business leaders in New York this week of a recent visit to her country's Pacific neighbors of Samoa, Tonga, Niue and the Cook Islands.\"Cyclones are not new to the region, but the scale and devastation of them in recent times is new,\" she said.Ardern said she saw village children in Tonga having to cross roads now regularly flooded on their way to school, and saltwater seeping into underground aquifers, destroying the islands' few freshwater supplies.\"There is a grinding reality in hearing someone from a Pacific island talk about where the sea was when they were a child, and potential loss of their entire village as an adult,\" Ardern told the General Assembly on Thursday.Faure, the president of Seychelles, insisted that he's not asking to shut down the global economy, with its global travel and trade. \"But we need to remain aware of its consequences on our planet and our future. Through our neglect, we risk our children inheriting a planet beyond their capacity to repair,\" said Faure.___Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/wirereporter", "headline": "Small islands use big platform to warn of climate change", "article_name": "small-islands-use-big-platform-to-warn-of-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/small-islands-use-big-platform-to-warn-of-climate-change", "date_published": "2018-09-27 00:00:00", "article_length": 5211, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:43.248591"}

Well, it\u2019s not a work of art\u2026 Tomi gives us the answer today in her 'First Thoughts.'Here\u2019s a headline for you: California  activists superglue themselves to the globe at Universal Studios.You know I have some thoughts on this.The headline is true. On Earth Day, members of a radical climate change rebellion group managed to scale the iconic globe at Universal Studios in Hollywood and apparently  themselves to the structure.Why? For attention, duh.The group, Extinction Rebellion LA, sent a list of demands to NBC, urging the network to take action on the climate crisis with the following proposals:1.That NBC/Universal declares that we are indeed in a Climate and Ecological Emergency -- that the extinction of the natural world is happening, that we are facing the collapse of civilization.2. That NBC/Universal will tell the whole truth about our climate and ecological emergency, including the failure of the U.S. government to respond with appropriate action/preparedness planning until now.3.That NBC reject all advertising from fossil fuel corporations, agrees to be zero-carbon by 2025, and publish a public, annual eco-audit of all NBC/Universal operations, including summary of key ecological and carbon data.4. That NBC ONLY permit think-tank spokespersons or lobbyists on the air to discuss the climate and ecological emergency whose funding is made fully transparent to viewers in each and every case.Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez set this stunt up? It sure sounds like it.Maybe instead of supergluing themselves to Hollywood infrastructure, these tree-huggers could use that time to clean up the trash and filth created by this state\u2019s drug and homeless epidemic. That would be a productive use of time.If they care so much about conservation and the environment, why don\u2019t they superglue themselves to Governor Gavin Newsom's\u00a0door and demand that HE do something about the thousands of needles littering the streets of San Francisco? Or what about the human feces?It's not just in San Fran. The problem plagues the entirety of our state from San Francisco to San Diego and everywhere in between.These climate change groups also conveniently ignore the many third-world style encampments and tent cities scattered throughout our Golden State of Homelessness. Heck, at the end of last year the Sacramento City Council  to dole out $400,000 to hire employees solely for the purpose of cleaning up homeless encampments in California\u2019s capital.In fact, according to Caltrans -- the California Department of Transportation --\u00a0the growing amounts of trash along our freeways can be partly attributed to the homeless encampments.You think?!Those are the same encampments that Democrats and climate change warriors in this state -- and across the nation -- conveniently ignore.So maybe instead of supergluing themselves to Hollywood infrastructure, these tree-huggers could use that time to clean up the trash and filth created by this state\u2019s drug and homeless epidemic. That would be a productive use of time.But wait, that kind of effort doesn\u2019t get headlines and attention, which is really all these activists are after, right?They couldn\u2019t care less about the actual environment. They just pull stunts to grandstand and validate their self-importance.So before they lecture NBC/Universal, or any of us for that matter, on the climate change apocalypse, perhaps they should adopt a highway, adopt some common sense, and adopt a true understanding of what the hell they\u2019re talking about.I better not see a single one of these protesters arriving or departing from their \u201cactivism\u201d in vehicles!If we are truly facing impending extinction due to global warming, do your part and walk your self-righteous behinds to your protests.God bless and get a clue.Tomi Lahren currently serves as host of FOX Nation's Final Thoughts and No Interruption.

He would also phase out gas-fired power plants.At a speech in Alexandria, Va., Bloomberg warned that \"we have to start working as hard as we can building a 100 percent clean energy economy because the alternative is just too bad for all of us.\"Standing at a podium with an \u2018END COAL 2030\u2019 campaign banner, he highlighted his goals \u2013 ensuring 80 percent clean electricity by the end of his second term in the White House, and moving the country toward\u00a0100 percent clean energy by 2045 or 2050.Among the first steps Bloomberg says he\u2019ll take if he\u2019s elected president would be ending all subsidies for fossil fuels, implementing stringent carbon and health pollutant standards for new gas plants, and putting a halt to construction of a new generation of fossil-fuel power plants.Bloomberg also pledges to prioritize communities that have suffered most from coal pollution or have been left behind in the transition to clean energy.\n      Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg unveils his plans to combat climate change at a campaign event in Alexandria, Virginia on Dec. 13, 2019\n      In announcing his plan, Bloomberg is taking aim at President Trump, criticizing the GOP incumbent for a lack of commitment to tackling climate change.\u201cThe president refuses to lead on climate change, so the rest of us must. I\u2019ve been all-in on this fight for more than a decade - and having helped close more than half the nation's dirty coal plants, having cut New York City's carbon footprint by 14 percent, having led a coalition of cities, states, and businesses committed to the Paris Agreement, I know that we can win,\u201d Bloomberg said.\u201cWe\u2019ve proven that you can transition to clean energy and strengthen the economy at the same time. As president, I'll accelerate our transition to a 100 percent\u00a0clean energy economy,\u201d he said.Trump vowed to save the coal industry as he campaigned for president in the 2016 election. The president\u2019s had mixed success in the White House in following through on his pledge. But openly targeting the industry remains politically risky in certain swing states, including Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.Bloomberg also said he would \"quadruple our investment in research and development across multiple federal agencies to work with the private sector to unlock more private capital for clean energy investment and work on sustainable development. And we also have to end the war on science that the Trump Administration is waging.\"Asked by Fox News about the price tag for his proposals, Bloomberg said: \"I don\u2019t know how you could possibly estimate the cost of something that is going to stretch out to 2050. No economist or mathematician is good enough to do those calculations.\"Bloomberg\u2019s poured millions of his own money to fund the effort to fight climate change.The candidate,\u00a0who\u2019s made the issue a central pillar of his presidential campaign, spoke in person at the beginning of this week at a United Nations global climate conference in Spain, while the official U.S. delegation kept a lower profile at the gathering.On Wednesday, Bloomberg teamed up with former Gov. Jerry Brown in California as part of the efforts of America's Pledge, a coalition of governors, mayors, leaders in the business world, and others focusing on\u00a0meeting global climate goals.Climate change has been one of the leading issues in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

{"id": null, "body": "\n        Dec. 7, 2015 - A picture of a globe at the COP21, the UN Climate Change Conference in Le Bourget, north of Paris. World governments are meeting to seek a solution to climate change, focusing on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, primarily by shifting from oil, coal and gas to cleaner energy sources. (AP) We recently joined nearly 400 other climate scientists, physicists, mathematicians, economists, theologians, philosophers, and ethicists in signing .We did so for one simple reason: Proposals to fight climate change doom billions of people to live in extreme poverty, a fate much worse than global warming.The global community has made remarkable progress in its fight against poverty. The UN\u2019s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) aimed to halve the number of people living below $1.25 per day by 2015. We thank the Lord that that target appears to have been met.How? By economic growth, primarily in China.The underlying foundations of climate predictions mean that, if one is truly interested in the well-being of poor people, the only realistic policy is to help improve their economic conditions. Even if that means allowing the climate to warm, it is unlikely that it would warm enough to pose danger, let alone a danger as great as poverty.Despite this, many people continue to live in abject poverty. One-quarter to one-third of the world\u2019s population \u20141.75 billion to 2.33 billion people\u2014lack access to electricity, and all but three million of those live outside rich, developed countries. Worse yet, some 2.7 billion still cook their food on inefficient stoves that use dung, crop residues, and wood. It is estimated that 2 to 4 million people die prematurely each year because of health problems associated with biomass-burning stoves.Although the MDGs do not talk about economic development, economic growth is the  way for whole societies to rise out of poverty. And economic development cannot occur without abundant, affordable, reliable, non-intermittent, on-demand energy.Many climate scientists argue that we need to mitigate global warming because it will most hurt the poor. Apparently these scientists do not understand their own models.Projections from climate models are based on the rates of poverty reduction. According to these models, the highest temperature projections occur when the poorest people in the world increase their incomes from $246 (measured in constant 1990 USD) to $49,000 per year by the end of the 21st century\u2014or approximately the U.S. GDP per capita in 2014.On the other hand, the lowest temperature projections result when per capita income of the poorest people rises to only $3,850 annually. Although that is some 15 times more than their current incomes, it still does not ensure levels of health, long life, and other benefits people in the developed world have taken for granted for a generation or more.Overcoming poverty brings with it enormous benefits to health and every other measure one cares to choose. Rich people can cope not only with natural catastrophes but also with different climates\u2014from the Arctic Circle to the Equator, from Death Valley to the Amazon rainforest\u2014better than poor people. Adequate wealth more than outweighs any damage from climate change.The underlying foundations of the climate predictions mean that, if one is truly interested in the well-being of poor people, the only realistic policy is to help improve their economic conditions. Even if that means allowing the climate to warm, it is unlikely that it would warm enough to pose danger, let alone a danger as great as poverty.By contrast, the foundational assumption in the IPCC climate models leads to the following conclusion: Rising CO2 emissions are, for the most part, a side effect of alleviating global poverty. To mitigate climate change we must force the vast majority of humankind to continue living in abject poverty.So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve endorsed the .

According to the protesting workers, the proposal is on track for a shareholder's vote next month, but company leadership is preparing to oppose it.Amazon's current goal is to control the company's carbon footprint over the next decade, not completely eliminate it. \"Our vision to make all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with 50 percent of all shipments net zero by 2030,\" a company spokesperson told PCMag.But the protesting workers say this isn't enough. \"Given Amazon's rate of growth, reaching 50 percent net-zero shipments by 2030 could still be an increase in emissions compared to today,\" their letter reads.The protesting works also oppose an Amazon effort to help fossil fuel companies streamline their IT systems to expand oil and gas mining. Amazon's clients include BP, Shell, and GE Oil and Gas, among others. \"To avert catastrophic warming, the science is clear: we must keep fossil fuels in the ground,\" their letter adds.In response, Amazon told PCMag that the company's long-term goal is to power the company's global infrastructure using only renewable energy. When this might be achieved Amazon didn't say, but the company plans to unveil new sustainability projects this year.\"In operations alone, we have over 200 scientists, engineers, and product designers dedicated exclusively to inventing new ways to leverage our scale for the good of customers and the planet,\" the company added.Amazon's past sustainability projects include creating wind and solar farms to power some company buildings.

He notes the greatest scientific discoveries in history have often broken with consensus.Astronomer Galileo Galilei was condemned to life under house arrest\u00a0for embracing\u00a0heliocentrism \u2013 the belief that the earth and planets revolve around the sun.In 1931, the book \"A Hundred Authors Against Einstein\" was published questioning his theory of relativity. More recently Australian scientist Barry Marshall upended accepted treatment for ulcers by suggesting they were not caused by stress, but by bacterial infection. Today, the standard ulcer treatment is an antibiotic.Christy\u00a0agrees that CO2 levels are increasing and the planet has warmed slightly, but his research indicates computer models that predict catastrophic consequences\u00a0of climate change are unrealistic.\"I take a real hard look at climate model output and can demonstrate that these models are just too sensitive to carbon dioxide,\" he said. \"The real world is not spiraling off into some dangerous territory of climate.\"For expressing that view and others (his research shows that rising CO2 levels have some beneficial effects \u2013 agricultural yields are higher than they've ever been, and the planet is greener than at any time in recorded history.) Yet, Christy\u00a0has been alienated from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, of which he used to be a part.After the rollout of the Green New Deal non-binding resolution, many Democratic Senators took to the well of the Senate to lambast what they believed was a ploy by\u00a0Majority Leader  the resolution\"We'll\u00a0give everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they feel about the Green New Deal,\" McConnell said.Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0called it a \"cynical stunt.\"\"I challenge Leader McConnell to say that our climate change crisis is real, that it\u2019s caused by humans, and that Congress needs to act,\" he said. \"This is what two-thirds of the American people agree with.\"An impassioned Sen.

Something's changing and it'll change back again,\" he said. \"I don't think it's a hoax. I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's man-made.

You know, we're talking about over a ... millions of years.\"As far as the climate \"changing back,\" temperature records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that the world hasn't had a cooler-than-average year since 1976 or a cooler-than-normal month since the end of 1985.Trump's comments came just days after a Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a warning that global warming would increase climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth.

While all eyes were trained on President Donald Trump\u2019s furious confrontation with China last week, Democrat officials at their party\u2019s convention in San Francisco again voted down a resolution calling for a candidate debate on climate change. That could prove a dire error.The decision to prevent a  will almost certainly encourage a third-party candidate. And that candidate could sabotage Democrats\u2019 chances of retaking the White House.Who might it be? It could be former Washington Gov.\u00a0Jay Inslee, who ran to highlight climate change but recently withdrew from the Democratic nomination race. Or maybe a billionaire like  or Michael\u00a0Bloomberg, who both similarly want to press Democrats to focus on global warming. They might not expect to win, but their campaigns could elevate the climate discussion.Remember that the Green Party put Jill Stein forward in 2016. Though few took Stein\u2019s candidacy seriously, in the end she attracted 1.4 million votes. In the aftermath of the election, some blamed her for Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss, pointing out that in the critical swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, Trump\u2019s margin of victory was less than the number of votes won by Stein.Since 2016, the climate issue has taken center stage in Democrats\u2019 platforms, becoming especially important to young voters who are playing a growing role in our elections. A Pew Center survey reports that voters under the age of 53 cast 62.2\u00a0million votes in the 2018 midterm elections, more than the 60.1 million recorded by people 53 and older. In the midterm contest, Gen Z and millennials made up 25 percent\u00a0of the total votes cast; their share will increase in 2020.Young voters are energized, and especially about global warming. A Harvard Kennedy School survey found climate change to be the third most important issue to voters under 30, behind immigration and the economy.The decision to prevent a climate debate will almost certainly encourage a third-party candidate. And that candidate could sabotage Democrats\u2019 chances of retaking the White House.For proof of the importance of young climate enthusiasts, look no further than the Sunrise Movement, an activist group begun only two years ago that has attracted tens of thousands of followers and staged protests in 250 cities around the country. It also takes credit for launching the Green New Deal, which, though widely mocked on the right, has been embraced by nearly every Democratic senator running for 2020.Sunrise representatives in attendance at the San Francisco convention erupted after the DNC vote to block a climate debate, chanting \u201cFailure of leadership\u201d and \u201cwe can\u2019t wait\u201d to protest the complicity of DNC Chair Tom Perez\u00a0in the decision; many stormed out of the meeting.Their anger was echoed on social media.Elizabeth Warren tweeted: \u201cClimate change is an existential threat that threatens (sic) all of us\u2026.That\u2019s why we need to have a #ClimateDebate.\u201dAl Gore chimed in, tweeting: \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 decision to sabotage a #ClimateDebate is extremely disappointing. Voters all over the U.S. are demanding we focus on the biggest threat to our nation and humanity\u2019s future and prioritize solving the climate crisis instead of continuing business as usual.\u201dThe hashtag #ClimateDebate trended on twitter in the wake of the vote, with nearly every Democrat hopeful weighing in. Climate warriors Greenpeace participated, tweeting \u201cWe just got word that the DNC voted to block a #climatedebate. We can\u2019t begin to tell you how outraged we are\u2026 Our political system is failing us, and it\u2019s failing a whole generation of people fighting for a better world.\u201dBlocking a climate debate was risky for Perez and other Democratic Party\u00a0officials. They must have known the decision would infuriate young voters, but they also recognized that such a forum could trip up their candidates. They knew that their over-the-top remedies to stem global warming might turn off much-needed independents, guaranteeing Trump\u2019s reelection.Consider Bernie Sanders\u2019 most recent plan to combat rising emissions, which is projected to cost $16 trillion. In a recent interview, even MSNBC\u2019s liberal Chris Hayes sounded anxious about the scope of Sanders\u2019 proposal, which he described as \u201creally large.\u201d He asked how Sanders would pay for such a mammoth overhaul, which includes \u201creplacing every old diesel school bus, replacing old mobile homes in the country,\u201d in addition to \u201ca federal takeover of the whole thing, that's essentially a Tennessee Valley Authority extension for the whole country\u2026\u201dIn a rambling response, Sanders explained that his program will be paid for with the money the federal government will make producing sustainable energy (though wind and power production still require subsidies), the elimination of \u201cmassive\u201d tax breaks now given to fossil fuel companies, the taxes received from the 20 million new \u201cgood-paying union jobs\u201d sure to be created, cuts to military spending, and higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy.Time does not allow a thorough debunking of this proposal, except to note that green activist group Oil Change International estimates the \u201csubsidies\u201d given to oil and coal producers at $20 billion annually, that the taxes that might be collected on 20 million union workers earning $100,000 apiece would be about $340 million, and that a 50 percent\u00a0hike in the individual income taxes paid by every American would yield only about $1 trillion. In other words, the numbers don\u2019t add up.Bernie is not alone, of course. Beto O\u2019Rourke has laid out a $5 trillion plan, and Elizabeth Warren has not one but five climate proposals in the hopper. Joe Biden has put forward a plan that only costs $1.7 trillion, earning him a \u201cC+\u201d grade from the liberal scolds at Mother Jones. And let\u2019s not forget the Green New Deal, estimated to cost north of $50 trillion.Perez and the Democrat machine are in a tight spot. Either allow Sanders and his rivals to alienate moderate voters by pushing programs that cost the moon, or risk providing a platform for a third party \u201cgreen\u201d candidate who can mobilize young voters.On the other hand, the debate could prove illuminating. In the MSNBC interview, Bernie starts off admitting, \u201cWell, the first thing is we cannot not afford it.\u201d\u00a0Bernie is confused and confusing.", "headline": "Liz Peek: Democrats diss young voters on climate change, opening door for a third party candidate", "article_name": "liz-peek-democrats-dis-climate-change-voters-third-party-opening", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/liz-peek-democrats-dis-climate-change-voters-third-party-opening", "date_published": "2019-08-26 00:00:00", "article_length": 6435, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:48.451096"}
{"id": null, "body": "\n        Dec. 7, 2015 - A picture of a globe at the COP21, the UN Climate Change Conference in Le Bourget, north of Paris. World governments are meeting to seek a solution to climate change, focusing on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, primarily by shifting from oil, coal and gas to cleaner energy sources. (AP) As negotiators in Paris worked to finalize a global agreement on climate change, the Republican-controlled House on Friday approved a bill that would block trade deals from being used to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Supporters said the wide-ranging bill would beef up enforcement of U.S. trade agreements and help prevent counterfeit goods from entering the country. The bill also would make permanent a moratorium that prevents states from taxing access to the Internet and blocks trade deals from requiring changes to U.S. immigration laws.The bill was approved on a 256-168 vote. Twenty-four Democrats joined with 232 Republicans to support the bill. The bill now goes to the Senate, where a vote is expected next week.Opponents, mostly Democrats, said the bill sends the wrong message as U.S. diplomats meet in Paris with more than 190 nations to finalize an agreement to reduce man-made carbon emissions and adapt to rising seas and increasingly extreme weather.Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., said the climate provision was inserted by Republicans who oppose action on climate change. Many Republicans in Congress question whether human activities are contributing to global warming.\"The Republican Party of the United States may be the only political party anywhere in denial about climate change,\" Levin said. \"That denial is why this provision ... on climate is before us.\"Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said the bill \"will level the playing field for Americans and also make it easier for them to compete in a global marketplace.\"The provisions on climate change and immigration ensure greater oversight of executive-branch negotiators who work on international trade agreements, Brady said.\"Trade agreements should not include provisions on immigration or greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said, noting that there are other ways for officials to address both immigration policy and global climate change.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the bill ensures that U.S. trade laws are enforced, that trade is streamlined and efficient and that trade agreements are not used to make significant changes to other U.S. policies, including expansion of access to visas allowing foreign nationals to enter the country.The provision on Internet taxation helps spur online innovation and \"preserve Internet freedom so it can continue to be an engine for economic growth and human development,\" McCarthy said.Democrats complained that the bill stripped important protections against currency manipulation and eliminated penalties against countries that engage in human trafficking.\"We need to get these countries to meet minimum standards on trafficking, certainly well before we enter into a trade and investment relationship with them,\" Levin said. \"Unfortunately, this (legislation) does not get us there.\"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bill \"turns a blind eye to human trafficking\" and criticized it for refusing to address climate change as part of trade negotiations.\"You can't separate climate and commerce,\" she said.The trade enforcement bill follows a series of votes over the summer in which the Republican-controlled Congress passed major legislation to strengthen President Barack Obama's hand in global trade talks.Obama reached a deal in October with 11 Pacific Rim countries that cuts trade barriers, sets labor and environmental standards and protects multinational corporations' intellectual property.Trade unions and liberal groups say the deal will expose American workers to foreign competition and cost jobs. Obama and most GOP leaders say the deal allows U.S. products to reach more markets.Under a law approved this year, Congress can approve or reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, but cannot change it.", "headline": "House backs bill to exclude climate change from trade deals", "article_name": "house-backs-bill-to-exclude-climate-change-from-trade-deals", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-backs-bill-to-exclude-climate-change-from-trade-deals", "date_published": "2015-12-20 00:00:00", "article_length": 4168, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:48.960863"}
{"id": null, "body": "\n        Sept. 27, 2013: Media representatives follow the U.N. IPCC climate report presentation, in Stockholm. I've studied climate and its effects on life\u2014all kinds of life ---for more than four decades, starting in 1968. Along the way, among other things, I developed a computer model of forests that in the 1990s we used to forecast the effects of climate on jack pine forests in Michigan that were the only habitat of the endangered Kirtland\u2019s warbler. \u00a0A lot of effort was going into saving the bird\u2019s habitat, and I wondered if, with global warming, it might all be in vain.As a result I'm one of the reviewers of sections of the latest report on climate change and its impact by the United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the first part of which was released last week in the form of a general summary for policymakers.I had some serious concerns about the sections of the much bigger report that I reviewed \u2014 which hasn't yet been released---and I have some of the same reservations about the document that was published last week. [pullquote]My biggest concern about the climate report is that it presents a number of speculative, and sometimes incomplete, conclusions embedded in \u00a0language that gives them more scientific heft than they deserve. The report, in other words, is \"scientific-sounding,\" rather than clearly settled and based on indisputable fact. \u00a0Established facts about the global environment exist less often in science than laymen usually think.The authors interpose a layer of opinion disguised as fact through their use of a language of \"high confidence\" and lesser degrees of that, and levels of \u201ccertainty\u201d ranging from \u201cunlikely\u201d to \u201ccertain.\u201d What do these \u201cconfidence\u201d levels and \u201cunlikely to virtually certain\u201d levels mean? The report states that \u201cconfidence\u201d is based on \u201cmechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment,\u201d and that certainty levels can also be based just on \u201cexpert judgment.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0The fact is, science doesn't work like that. \u00a0I can\u2019t think of any major scientific advances that were put in these terms as a key way to evaluate them.Equally \u00a0important, the just published summary does not show where its data came from\u2014 it refers to a \u201cbox\u201d and \u201cchapter 1\" of the full report, which aren\u2019t available now. \u00a0This makes it all the tougher to evaluate the language of \u201chigh confidence\" etc., which, in the end, papers over whether the material is truly based on science or not.For example, the report states that \u201con a global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface.\u201d Either this is a truism (the sun must be heating the ocean surface first) or it is meant to take into account the complex circulations that occur in the ocean, like the Gulf Stream\u2019s involvement in a vertical rise of waters from deep ocean layers in one region and sinking of the cooled surface waters as the stream reaches its northern limit. The report would be more meaningful if it made a straightforward statement about the measuring methods and data on which this conclusion is based. The fact that it doesn't may make it easier for non-scientists to repeat the generalization, but it obscures what this debate needs most: \u00a0transparency about methods, and clarity about facts.Indeed, the report\u2019s language appears to be sometimes coupled with a selective reading or oversimplification of the facts, so that the authors have \"high confidence\" in something that is not the whole story. For example, they state that over the past two decades, Arctic sea ice cover has \u201ccontinued to decrease in extent (high confidence).\u201d But in 2010 I co-authored \u00a0a paper with two sea ice experts and a historian/ethnologist in which we used nineteenth-century records from whaling ships hunting bowhead whales in the north Pacific and beyond, along the Arctic sea ice edge. We compared 23,000 days of observations in those records with late twentieth-century observations, and concluded that the extent of the sea ice at the end of winter was pretty much the same in the nineteenth and late twentieth century, but that the end-of-summer Arctic sea ice retreat is greater today than it was then. \u00a0These kinds of more subtle findings could make a big difference in one\u2019s level of \u201cconfidence.\"The report\u2019s heavy dependence on existing climate models creates further problems. Models, like all scientific theory, have to be tested against real-world observations. Physicists still continually try to test Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity as new opportunities arise, even though it was first published in 1916. The theory has cleared test after test, but researchers keep trying to find its limits and thereby also the limits of its applications. The most recent test of relativity took place in 2013. Scientists call such tests \u201cvalidation.\u201d \u00a0Experts in model validation say that the climate models frequently cited in the IPCC report are little if any validated. \u00a0This means that as theory they are fundamentally scientifically unproven.Many versions of climate models are in use, but they are all based on the same theory. We do not have competing theories, just competing variations of one theory. As a result, the current report can confuse a reader even more as to what is fact and what is speculation based on poorly validated models. This is another way that opinion is hidden under what is called science; it is theory untested and therefore not by itself science. \u00a0A more powerful science would involve strongly different ways of approaching theory, to see which accounted for more observations. \u00a0And following the standard scientific rule called \u201cOccam\u2019s Razor,\u201d we would go with the simplest model that accounted for the same data as a more complex one.The bigger problem is that when it comes to climate, models have become our new reality, rather than something we test and discard when reality brings their weakness to our attention. \u00a0Because global environmental data are generally so sparse and have not been gathered comprehensively for long, the tendency is to believe the models as our truth.This will be to our disadvantage. Having worked for decades on climate change and its possible effects on life, I come away from the just published \"summary for policymakers\" believing that it does not allow a scientist, let alone a policymaker, to decide that we are, or are not, creating a global warming. As a result, I foresee two dangers. One is that it will simply \u00a0intensify the political, ideological and, yes, moral debate that has erupted over who does and does not believe we are causing global warming, and thus move us even farther from the important scientific effort that the issue deserves.The second danger may be even worse: it reinforces the belief that there is some kind of climate normality, usually characterized as existing earlier in the twentieth century or before the Industrial Revolution (but after the Little Ice Age, which lasted from approximately the mid-1400s to 1700) that is desirable, even necessary, for our species and for the ecology of the planet.In fact, there has never been such a thing, which is one of the reasons that biological evolution and adaptation exist in the first place.As I discuss in my book \"\" only by using nature's dynamics as a guide, rather than \u00a0best-guess, sweeping \u00a0climate models, will we understand the naturalness of change, and thereby conserve the biodiversity of life on Earth---that is, for millions of species, including our own.", "headline": "Climate change warnings -- science or \"scientific-sounding\"?", "article_name": "climate-change-warnings-science-or-scientific-sounding", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/climate-change-warnings-science-or-scientific-sounding", "date_published": "2015-05-08 00:00:00", "article_length": 7472, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:49.585118"}

It\u00a0goes into particular detail about what will happen if there is too great of a reliance on the private sector to combat the changing climate.\"Rather than helping the world adapt to climate change, privatizing basic services and social protection may be a form of maladaptation,\" Alston wrote in the report.\u00a0\"When hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc in New York in 2012, stranding low-income and vulnerable New Yorkers without access to power and healthcare, the Goldman Sachs headquarters was protected by tens of thousands of its own sandbags and power from its generator.\"\n      A smoking chimney in Ludwigshafen, Germany.(AP Photo/Michael Probst, File)\n      The report continues: \"Private white-glove firefighters have been dispatched to save the mansions of high-end insurance customers from wildfires. 'An over-reliance on the private sector could lead to a climate apartheid scenario in which the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger, and conflict, while the rest of the world is left to suffer.'\"Alston likened it to a coming \"climate apartheid,\" where the wealthy are able to mitigate some of the potentially catastrophic effects, such as food insecurity, disease and death, and the poor, \"who have contributed the least to emissions and have the least capacity to react, will be the most harmed.\"The poorest 3.5 billion people are responsible for just 10 percent of carbon emissions, while the richest 10 percent are responsible for a \"full half,\" Alston estimated. He added that someone in the wealthiest 1 percent \"uses 175 times more carbon than one in the bottom 10 percent.\"A  from non-profit CDP estimated that just 100 companies around the world were responsible for 71 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

And so, they have a vested interest in not the science \u2013 whatever that may be \u2013 but in stating that carbon dioxide is sort of an evil gas and therefore has to be regulated and has to be controlled.\"For those looking to find a glimmer of hope in the new IPCC report, researchers found that majorly  or \"tipping points\" were of \"low likelihood,\" including ice sheet collapses and the abrupt slowdown of ocean currents.The report suggested that warming could be reversed through \"negative emissions\" \u2013 extracting more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is added \u2013 though the term \"fossil fuels\" is not included in the summary or .Man-made CO2 removal \"leading to net negative emissions\" would lower CO2 in the atmosphere, . And even if this were achieved and sustained, increases in temperature would be reversed but other climate changes would continue in the \"current direction for decades to millennia.\"However, the panel doesn\u2019t explain how this could be achieved and many scientists remain skeptical of its plausibility.Michael Shellenberger, the author of \"Apocalypse Never\" and founder and president of Environmental Progress, told Fox News that most of the important trends regarding climate change are currently headed in the right direction.\"\"Climate change is real. It\u2019s caused by human emissions \u2013 at least a significant amount of it is.

But, the trends are mostly going in the right direction.\"Shellenberger said the IPCC report\u2019s \"scary\" scenarios were inaccurate because there is \"no possibility\" that they could occur due to the usage of natural gas over coal across the world.The environmental journalist said that while the IPCC science is \"mostly fine,\" he highlighted that there are \"some games that get played\" in the panel\u2019s reports, including \"a bunch of scenarios that basically everybody acknowledges [are] not going to happen because we\u2019re not going to increase coal use sixfold.\"The report\u2019s claim that the world is seeing more extreme weather is misleading, Shellenberger says, because it leads people to think that disasters are getting worse.Droughts can be worsened by warmer temperatures but are explained by natural variability and high-intensity fires can be avoided by better , he argued \u2013 though allowing that climate scientists can point to longer fire seasons over larger geographic areas.Nevertheless, he said human beings are more resilient to extreme weather events and carbon emissions would go down globally over the coming decade.\"The takeaway is that climate change is not what people think it is. It is significantly outweighed by things like droughts, which are still determined by natural variables and by economic development and preparedness, and we\u2019re just so much better prepared,\" he told Fox News.\"We\u2019re more resilient to changing temperatures than we\u2019ve ever been and it\u2019s just not the end of the world.\"", "headline": "Scientists challenge 'alarm bells' in IPCC climate change report: 'Not the end of the world'", "article_name": "ipcc-climate-change-reports-claims-challenged-by-skeptics", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/ipcc-climate-change-reports-claims-challenged-by-skeptics", "date_published": "2021-08-12 00:00:00", "article_length": 9698, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:52.122634"}

Because no nation can meet this global threat alone.\"Obama was the headliner at a marathon session of world leaders who promised to spend billions of dollars to take better care of the planet.Tuesday's one-day meeting at the annual U.N. General Assembly involving more than 100 world leaders was a forum for non-binding pledges. It was designed to lay the groundwork for a new global treaty to tackle climate change in December 2015, but it also revealed the sharp differences that divide countries on matters such as deforestation, carbon pollution and methane leaks from oil and gas production:-- Brazil, a key player in deforestation, said it wouldn't sign a pledge to halt deforestation by 2030.-- The United States decided not to join 73 countries in supporting a price on carbon, which Congress had indicated it would reject.-- And minutes after Obama said \"nobody gets a pass,\" China's Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli insisted the world treat developing nations, including China, differently than developed nations, allowing them release more heat-trapping pollution. China has signed a carbon-pricing agreement.\"Today we must set the world on a new course,\" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said in opening remarks. \"Climate change is the defining issue of our age. It is defining our present. Our response will define our future.\"In some ways, the climate summit answered that call.The European Union said its member nations would cut greenhouse gases so that by 2030 they would be 40 percent below the 1990 level. The vow also calls for using renewable energy for 27 percent of the bloc's power needs and to increase energy efficiency by 30 percent.The United States will not release new emissions targets until early next year.More than 150 countries set the first-ever deadline on Tuesday to end deforestation by 2030, but the feasibility of that goal was eroded when a key player, Brazil, said it would not join. Forests are important because they absorb the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The United States, Canada and the entire European Union signed onto a declaration to halve forest loss by 2020 and eliminate deforestation entirely by 2030.And world leaders promised in their non-binding remarks to spend a total of at least $5 billion to make the world more sustainable. That often includes turning away from the burning of coal, oil and gas and away from the destruction of the world's carbon-absorbing forests.Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, stressed it could be done without harming the economy. He said over the next seven years, the European Union would provide $3 billion euros (nearly $3.9 billion) to help developing countries become more sustainable.\"The European Union is on track to meet our targets and at same time we have seen our economy grow,\" Barroso. \"We prove climate protection and a strong economy must go hand in hand.\"France promised $1 billion. Korea pledged $100 million. Others, like Chile, pledged cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.When it comes to forests, if the goal is met, the U.N. says it would be the equivalent of taking every car off the road in the world. A group of companies, countries, and nonprofits also pledged to restore more than 1 million square miles of forest worldwide by 2030. Norway vowed to spend $350 million to protect forests in Peru and another $100 million in Liberia.Japan, which had relaxed earlier promised targets, vowed to issue new goals early next year and become a model for a low-carbon society. It also said it was launching a satellite to monitor and verify emissions. Canada pledged to make cars and trucks more fuel efficient.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro used the opportunity to chastise \"polluting powers\" for causing an \"evil of such planetary dimensions\" and then wanting to barter their way out of their responsibilities.Seychelles President James Michel called small island nations like his \"victims of this pollution\" and said it was up to the countries that burn the most coal, oil and gas to do the most.\"If they don't do something, the Earth will not survive and that will be the end of us all,\" Michel said in an interview before the start of the summit.Ban, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Rajendra K. Pachauri, who headed the Nobel Prize-winning panel of scientists that studied the issue, warned that time was short. By 2020, Ban said, the world must reduce greenhouse gases to prevent an escalating level of warming that world leaders five years ago called dangerous. Leaders in 2009 pledged to keep world temperatures from increasing by another 2 degrees Fahrenheit (3.6 degrees Celsius).Pachauri and Ban told world leaders the effects of global warming are already here, pointing to a U.N. building that flooded during the devastating Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Pachauri said it will get worse with droughts, storms, food and water shortages. He foresaw even more violent climate-driven conflicts.And, Pachauri said, \"a steady rise in our death toll, especially among the world's poorest.

Scientists at the observatory have been measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide levels since 1958. But because of other kinds of analysis, such as those done on ancient air bubbles trapped in ice cores, they have data on levels reaching back 800,000 years. []During the ice ages, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were around 200 ppm. And during the interglacial periods \u2014 the planet is currently in an interglacial period \u2014 levels were around 280 ppm, .But every story has its villains: Humans are burning fossil fuels, causing the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which are adding an extra blanket on an already feverish planet. So far, global temperatures have risen by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the 19th century or pre-industrial times, according to a  released last year by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Every year, the Earth sees about 3 ppm more carbon dioxide in the air, said Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of meteorology at Penn State University. \"If you do the math, well, it's pretty sobering,\" he said. \"We'll cross 450 ppm in just over a decade.\"The subsequent warming is already causing changes to the planet \u2014 shrinking glaciers, bleaching coral reefs and intensifying heat waves and storms, among other impacts. And carbon dioxide levels higher than 450 ppm \"are likely to lock in dangerous and irreversible changes in our climate,\" Mann told Live Science.\"CO2 levels will continue to increase for at least the next decade and likely much longer, because not enough is being done worldwide,\" said Donald Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"The long-term increase is due to human-related emissions, especially the emissions of our burning of fossil fuels.\"However, he noted that the annual peak in carbon dioxide, which fluctuates throughout the year as plants change their breathing rhythms, occurs right now. The annual average value will be more like 410 to 412 ppm, he said.

Smaller ice sheets, in turn, might reduce the reflectivity of the planet and potentially accelerate the warming even more, he added.\"It's like we're playing with a loaded gun and don't know how it works.\"", "headline": "Carbon dioxide soars to record-breaking levels not seen in 800,000 years", "article_name": "carbon-dioxide-soars-to-record-breaking-levels-not-seen-in-800000-years", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/carbon-dioxide-soars-to-record-breaking-levels-not-seen-in-800000-years", "date_published": "2019-05-15 00:00:00", "article_length": 3535, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:55.589050"}

The mysterious fall of the largest of the world's earliest urban civilizations nearly 4,000 years ago in what is now India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh now appears to have a key culprit \u2014 ancient climate change, researchers say.Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia may be the best known of the first great urban cultures, but the largest was the Indus or Harappan civilization. This culture once extended over more than 386,000 square miles (1 million square kilometers) across the plains of the Indus River from  to the Ganges, and at its peak may have accounted for 10 percent of the world population. The civilization developed about 5,200 years ago, and slowly disintegrated between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago \u2014 populations largely abandoned cities, migrating toward the east.\"Antiquity knew about Egypt and Mesopotamia, but the Indus civilization, which was bigger than these two, was completely forgotten until the 1920s,\" said researcher Liviu Giosan, a geologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. \"There are still many things we don't know about them.\"[pullquote]Nearly a century ago, researchers began discovering numerous remains of Harappan settlements along the Indus River and its tributaries, as well as in a vast desert region at the border of India and Pakistan. Evidence was uncovered for sophisticated cities, sea links with Mesopotamia, internal trade routes, arts and crafts, and as-yet undeciphered writing.\"They had cities ordered into grids, with exquisite plumbing, which was not encountered again until the Romans,\" Giosan told LiveScience. \"They seem to have been a more democratic society than Mesopotamia and Egypt \u2014 no large structures were built for important personalitiess like kings or pharaohs.\"Like their contemporaries in Egypt and Mesopotamia, , who were named after one of their largest cities, lived next to rivers.\"Until now, speculations abounded about the links between this mysterious ancient culture and its life-giving mighty rivers,\" Giosan said.Now Giosan and his colleagues have reconstructed the landscape of the plain and rivers where this  developed. Their findings now shed light on the enigmatic fate of this culture.\"Our research provides one of the clearest examples of climate change leading to the ,\" Giosan said. []The researchers first analyzed satellite data of the landscape influenced by the Indus and neighboring rivers. From 2003 to 2008, the researchers then collected samples of sediment from the coast of the Arabian Sea into the fertile irrigated valleys of Punjab and the northern Thar Desert to determine the origins and ages of those sediments and develop a timeline of landscape changes.\"It was challenging working in the desert \u2014 temperatures were over 110 degrees Fahrenheit all day long (43 degrees C),\" Giosan recalled.After collecting data on geological history, \"we could reexamine what we know about settlements, what crops people were planting and when, and how both agriculture and settlement patterns changed,\" said researcher Dorian Fuller, an archaeologist with University College London. \"This brought new insights into the process of eastward population shift, the change towards many more small farming communities, and the decline of cities during late Harappan times.\"Some had suggested that the Harappan heartland received its waters from a large glacier-fed Himalayan river, thought by some to be the Sarasvati, a sacred river of . However, the researchers found that only rivers fed by monsoon rains flowed through the region.Previous studies suggest the Ghaggar, an intermittent river that flows only during strong monsoons, may best approximate the location of the Sarasvati. Archaeological evidence suggested the river, which dissipates into the desert along the dried course of Hakra valley, was home to intensive settlement during Harappan times.\"We think we settled a long controversy about the mythic Sarasvati River,\" Giosan said.Initially, the monsoon-drenched rivers the researchers identified were prone to devastating floods. Over time, monsoons weakened, enabling agriculture and civilization to flourish along flood-fed riverbanks for nearly 2,000 years.\"The insolation \u2014 the solar energy received by the Earth from the sun \u2014 varies in cycles, which can impact monsoons,\" Giosan said. \"In the last 10,000 years, the Northern Hemisphere had the highest insolation from 7,000 to 5,000 years ago, and since then insolation there decreased. All climate on Earth is driven by the sun, and so the monsoons were affected by the lower insolation, decreasing in force. This meant less rain got into continental regions affected by monsoons over time.\" []Eventually, these monsoon-based rivers held too little water and dried, making them unfavorable for civilization.\"The Harappans were an enterprising people taking advantage of a window of opportunity \u2014 a kind of \"Goldilocks civilization,\" Giosan said.Eventually, over the course of centuries, Harappans apparently fled along an escape route to the east toward the Ganges basin, where monsoon rains remained reliable.\"We can envision that this eastern shift involved a change to more localized forms of economy \u2014 smaller communities supported by local rain-fed farming and dwindling streams,\" Fuller said. \"This may have produced smaller surpluses, and would not have supported large cities, but would have been reliable.\"This change would have spelled disaster for the cities of the Indus, which were built on the large surpluses seen during the earlier, wetter era. The dispersal of the population to the east would have meant there was no longer a concentrated workforce to support urbanism.\"Cities collapsed, but smaller agricultural communities were sustainable and flourished,\" Fuller said. \"Many of the urban arts, such as writing, faded away, but agriculture continued and actually diversified.\"These findings could help guide future archaeological explorations of . Researchers can now better guess which settlements might have been more significant, based on their relationships with rivers, Giosan said.It remains uncertain how monsoons will react to . \"If we take the devastating floods that caused the largest humanitarian disaster in Pakistan's history as a sign of increased monsoon activity, than this doesn't bode well for the region,\" Giosan said. \"The region has the largest irrigation scheme in the world, and all those dams and channels would become obsolete in the face of the large floods an increased monsoon would bring.\"The scientists detailed their findings online May 28 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "headline": "4,000 years ago, climate change caused massive civilization collapse", "article_name": "4000-years-ago-climate-change-caused-massive-civilization-collapse", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/4000-years-ago-climate-change-caused-massive-civilization-collapse", "date_published": "2015-01-13 00:00:00", "article_length": 6747, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:57.130668"}

Even former NASA scientist and outspoken climate change activist James Hansen has acknowledged the 10-year lull.Morano said: \"In the peer-reviewed literature we're finding hundreds of factors influence global temperature, everything from ocean cycles to the tilt of the earth's axis to water vapor, methane, cloud feedback, volcanic dust, all of these factors are coming together. They're now realizing it wasn't the simple story we've been told of your SUV is creating a dangerously warm planet.\"Many climate scientists and environmentalists agree with Morano's description of climate complexity, but reject his denials of global warming as a problem.\"This is a highly complex calculation to make in the first place. The short period of time, only 10 years in which the increasing temperature has leveled, really doesn't tell us very much other than the fact that temperatures may still be rising but just not as fast as they were before,\" said Elgie Holstein, the senior director for strategic planning at the Environmental Defense Fund and a former assistant secretary at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\"What's compelling about the climate science,\" Holstein said, \"is that we have literally thousands of the world's leading scientists around the country pretty much saying the same thing about where we're headed, and it's not reassuring.\"But the surface temperature stabilization suggests that computer models which predict harsh consequences of global warming may need reassessing.As The Economist put it on March 30, \"It may be that the climate is responding to higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in ways that had not been properly understood before. This possibility, if true, could have profound significance both for climate science and for environmental and social policy.\"Indeed, no one disputes that levels of carbon dioxide are increasing globally, but CO2's impact has not been as great as many scientists had predicted.\"In the peer-reviewed literature, they've tried to explain away this lull,\" said Morano. \"In the proceedings of the National Academy of Science a year or two ago they had a study blaming Chinese coal use for the lack of global warming. So, in an ironic twist, global warming proponents are now claiming that that coal use is saving us from dangerous global warming.\"Holstein believes the temperature lull is not entirely unexpected or unpredicted.\"We're within ranges of these climate models that are saying we're still on track to some pretty troublesome impacts if we don't do something about it,\" he said.A Gallup survey conducted March 7-10 found 58 percent of Americans say they worry a great deal or fair amount about global warming.That was up from 51 percent in 2011 -- but still below the 62-72 percent levels seen between 1999 and 2001.", "headline": "Climate change skeptics seize on reports showing temperatures leveling", "article_name": "climate-change-skeptics-seize-on-reports-showing-temperatures-leveling", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-change-skeptics-seize-on-reports-showing-temperatures-leveling", "date_published": "2015-12-20 00:00:00", "article_length": 3366, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:17:59.334197"}

{"id": null, "body": " may be getting a glimpse of its globally warmed future.Experts agreed Tuesday that no one drought, flood or wildfire can be attributed to global warming, but they stressed that the eucalyptus forests and farms of southeastern Australia are becoming warmer, drier and more prone to fire as the planet heats up.Some say rising temperatures are making Australia's climate more extreme at the edges. Snow will disappear from the few mountains that still have it, the cyclones that batter the topical north could get more powerful and the conditions that set the southeast ablaze could become common.\"The terrible events of the past couple of weeks are, without doubt, partly the result of global warming and the greenhouse effect,\" said Neville Nicholls, an expert on climate change and wildfires at Australia's Monash University.Global warming cannot be blamed for starting the hundreds of recent fires -- tens of thousands of such blazes erupt across Australia every fire season, from October to March -- but the effects of climate change exacerbated their ferocity, Nicholls said.First, a decade of drought has made Australia's wild forests -- known as \"the bush\" -- tinder dry. Second, a sustained and record-breaking heat wave settled over the region. Lastly, record-smashing temperatures on Saturday topped 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees Celsius) and combined with winds up to 60 mph (100 kph) to whip fires into furnace-like intensity.The , the Nobel Prize-winning team of scientists responsible for advising the  about global warming, says the rise in the atmosphere's temperature could cause water shortages, crop failures, more deaths from heat waves and more severe storms around the world.In Australia, it means more droughts in the dry south and more flooding in the tropical north. The , the world's largest coral reef system rich in sealife and sensitive to small temperature changes, is in trouble.The Australian government's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization concluded in 2007 that the country's average temperature will rise about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 C) by 2030 and up to 9 degrees F (5 C) by 2070 if greenhouse emissions are not curbed.An island large enough to be counted as a continent, Australia's climate varies with its landscape. It is home to dry shifting dunes in the desert \"red heart,\" misty Riesling grape-clad hills, and lush monsoonal rain forest and mangrove swamps.Among the panel's forecasts: Climate change would likely mean less rain, but rainfalls that did occur would be more intense. Drought in the south -- the wheat-, sheep- and cattle-growing food belt -- would be more frequent and fires more common. Cyclones that are a regular feature of the summer months in the north would hit harder.Even as southeastern Australia sweltered and the fires raged this week, some 60 percent of northeastern Queensland state was covered by floodwaters after weeks of drenching rain from a dying offshore cyclone. Three thousand homes were damaged. No deaths were reported.While scientists cautioned against attributing the wildfires themselves to global warming, they said changing conditions from rising temperatures are having an impact.\"Australia -- and particularly the southeastern corner of Australia -- is fire prone, so a fire-prone environment coupled with a warmer and drier climate in the future is likely to increase the incidence of this kind of event,\" said Mark Adams, a wildfire expert at the University of Sydney. \"But statistically, we won't be able to prove it for many decades.\"Adams said Australia's peculiar ecosystems are particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. An increase of just one or two degrees would cause snow in Australia to disappear, and its Great Barrier Reef and rainforests are particularly sensitive to warming, he said.\"But I don't think that on the whole Australia is more susceptible than many other -- or indeed any other -- continent,\" Adams said.Penny Whetton, leader of the climate change research group at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, also cautioned against tying the fires too closely to global warming.\"Due to changes in the climate, the high risk of fires has increased and will increase,\" she said. \"But that is different than saying climate change caused these fires. It's difficult to relate climate change to an individual weather event.\"For conservationists, the dry conditions and the devastating fires bolster their campaign to push the world's governments to move faster on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.\"It's a sobering reminder of the need for this nation and the whole world to act and to put at a priority our need to tackle climate change in a way that politicians have simply been unable or refused to do in past decades,\" said Sen.

So I would encourage the chair of the party to listen to the former vice president and hundreds of thousands of grassroots folks and party chairs and me and make sure this gets a full and fair debate,\u201d he said.Perez,, defended his climate change record while steering the DNC the past two years.\u201cClimate change is an urgent threat to our nation and our planet,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt imperils our children and grandchildren\u2019s future, and it disproportionately affects our most vulnerable communities. That\u2019s why, beginning in 2017, I made clear to our media partners that the issue of climate change must be featured prominently in our debates. That didn\u2019t happen in 2016\u200a\u2014\u200aand it was wrong.\u201dBut in explaining his opposition to Inslee\u2019s push, Perez said \u201cif\u00a0we change our guidelines at the request of one candidate who has made climate change their campaign\u2019s signature issue, how do we say no to the numerous other requests we\u2019ve had? How do we say no to other candidates in the race who may request debates focused on an issue they\u2019ve made central to their own campaigns?\u201dAnd he pointed to other options to spotlight the issue of climate change.\u201cAlready, a number of organizations and networks have hosted their own issue-based forums and town halls\u200a\u2014\u200aand I hope and expect more of these will take place in the coming months,\u201d Perez emphasized. \u201cNobody is prohibited from participating in a DNC-sanctioned debate because they participated in a climate change forum or town hall.\u201dWhile Inslee twice gave Biden a shout-out for joining the calls for a climate change debate, he targeted the former vice president\u2019s efforts on the issue.Inslee, who last week said that Biden\u2019s new proposal to produce net-zero emissions and reach a 100 percent clean energy economy by 2050 lacks \u201cteeth,\u201d criticized the former vice president again.\u201cI am the only candidate who has said this has to be the first priority of the United States. I am the only candidate who has said that. He (Biden) has not,\u201d Inslee told Fox News.\u201cI\u2019m the only candidate who has said we have to get off coal with ... teeth in a law in the next ten years. He has not. I\u2019m the only candidate who has said we need to make our transportation system electric in the next decade and a half. He has not,\u201d Inslee spotlighted. \u201cSo there are some differences.\u201d", "headline": "Inslee ramps up pressure campaign for DNC to hold climate change debate, says earth\u2019s \u2018on fire\u2019", "article_name": "inslee-says-the-earths-on-fire-dnc-debate-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/inslee-says-the-earths-on-fire-dnc-debate-climate-change", "date_published": "2019-06-13 00:00:00", "article_length": 4245, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:03.253973"}

But now these same cities have confessed to the markets that they have no idea whether the climate is changing and whether it will have any effect on their citizens.During the last year, Oakland, San Francisco, and several other California cities and towns took to the courts to set their own policies on global warming, even though no activity within their borders could make the slightest dent in worldwide temperatures.They filed lawsuits against Exxon and more than a dozen energy companies claiming that future rises in sea levels will literally erode property values.\u00a0 They demand that the companies fork over millions to remedy this imminent\u00a0economic calamity.Put aside for the moment the absurdity of pinning sole responsibility for the effects of climate change on a handful of companies. Climate change is a worldwide phenomenon to which human activity for decades, if not centuries, has contributed.\u00a0 Scholars continue to argue how much global temperatures will change in the future, which conduct is responsible, and whether reducing it is worth the costs in reduced economic growth. Californians have certainly not restrained themselves in the cause of climate control: they have a love affair with driving, especially Angelenos, many of whom seem to hate public transportation almost as much as they hate \u201cbig oil.\u201dCalifornians have certainly not restrained themselves in the cause of climate control: they have a love affair with driving, especially Angelenos, many of whom seem to hate public transportation almost as much as they hate \u201cbig oil.\u201dAlso put aside for a moment the factual errors in the municipalities\u2019 suits. Exxon, in particular, has acknowledged the link between fossil fuel use and climate change, supported the Paris climate agreement, and even backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax (which we did not). Yes, it is a fossil fuel company but far from concealing the truth, Exxon has been more than willing to adapt to changing climate awareness.Can the lawsuits even show how much Exxon has individually contributed to changes in global temperature?\u00a0 If San Francisco and Oakland are suing Exxon, why don\u2019t they also sue every company in China and India?\u00a0 The economic growth of these two developing giants no doubt has contributed far more to global warming than any American company or the United States in general.Instead, consider the hypocrisy laid bare this week in an Exxon court filing.\u00a0 It points out that many of the California towns and cities took the exact opposite position in their municipal bond offerings.\u00a0 When borrowing money, they took pains to insulate themselves from liabilities stemming from climate change when offering bonds to investors.\u00a0\u00a0Some said they had no way to predict accurately risk related to rising sea levels or climate change or simply failed to mention such risks.\u00a0 Apparently, these cities and towns believe it is better to tell the truth to the markets in New York City than to judges and jurors in court.For example, in its bond offering in 2017, Santa Cruz states, \u201cAreas within the county may be subject to unpredictable climatic conditions, such as flood, droughts and destructive storms.\u201d And yet, in its lawsuits against the energy companies, Santa Cruz declared with righteous certainty that there is a \u201c\u2026a 98% chance that the County experiences a devastating three-foot flood before the year 2050, and a 22% chance that such a flood occurs before 2030.\u201dIn its 2017 bond offering, San Francisco acknowledged, \u201cThe City is unable to predict whether sea-level rise or other impacts of climate change or flooding from a major storm will occur, when they may occur, and if any such events occur, whether they will have a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial condition of the City and the local economy.\u201d But in its lawsuit, the city declared, \u201cGlobal warming-induced sea level rise is already causing flooding of low-lying areas of San Francisco\u2026\u201dAnd this was even before smoking marijuana became legal in California.These contradictions only underscore the highly political origin and motivation of the city lawsuits. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers include Matthew Pawa, long regarded as an innovative and entrepreneurial strategist when it comes to using the court room as a substitute for the legislature to advance climate change orthodoxy. It is no coincidence that Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, a large plaintiffs firm based in Seattle, recently announced that it is expanding its environmental practice by acquiring the Pawa Law Group.\u00a0 Municipalities likely welcome the chance to outsource the costs of litigation to firms working on a contingency basis. Rulings by environmentalist-friendly judges could mean a big pay day for all, giving new meaning to the \u201cgreen\u201d movement.In a petition filed in Texas court early this week, Exxon lays out the conflict between what the cities have told judges and what they have told the bond markets. Exxon is asking the court to require government officials to answer questions under oath about those statements. The case could have broad implications for the bond markets, as investors could have legal grounds to challenge the local governments for similar inconsistencies.\u00a0 In the end, the cities\u2019 mismanagement will come home to roost in higher borrowing costs and, ultimately, higher taxes for their residents.", "headline": "California cities and crazy climate change lawsuits - Do as I say, not as I do", "article_name": "california-cities-and-crazy-climate-change-lawsuits-do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/california-cities-and-crazy-climate-change-lawsuits-do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do", "date_published": "2018-02-19 00:00:00", "article_length": 5535, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:03.858424"}
{"id": null, "body": "The public's concern about global warming has remained below 45 percent while progressive Democrats push a green agenda on Capitol Hill.I am dismayed to hear that NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press\u201d is actually blaming  for its decision to shut down any intelligent, meaningful discussion about . \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give time to climate deniers,\u201d the show\u2019s host recently said, referring to people, including Nobel laureates, who disagree that humans are mostly to blame for altering Earth\u2019s climate. \u201cThe science is settled even if political opinion is not.\u201dFor the record I\u2019m neither a \u201cdenier\u201d or an \u201calarmist.\u201d I\u2019m a physicist who does his very best to seek the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I\u2019m also a journalist who\u2019s been covering the complexities of the climate change story since the 1980s, even reporting directly from the north and south poles, where much of the climate research is done.My point here is not to debate the merits of today\u2019s resolute scientific consensus that humans are having a decisive, apocalyptic impact on the climate. It might very well be correct.My point is that if you are absolutely, 100 percent convinced it is \u2013 as evidently the producers of the aforementioned news show are \u2013 you have a right to say your mind is settled, or your politics are settled. But never say the science of this or any equally complex subject is \u201csettled.\u201d That crucial lesson was learned centuries ago, when something far simpler than Earth\u2019s mercurial climate was being hotly debated. Back then the scientific community was convinced beyond any doubt that our planet was at the center of the universe. In the sixteenth century, Nicolaus Copernicus \u2013 a \u201cgeocentric denier,\u201d to use today\u2019s pejorative labeling \u2013 was derided for believing the sun was at the center of everything.Mainstream scientists and university professors of the day proclaimed the science was settled and justified their \u201cevidence-based\u201d derision of Copernicus by citing the mountain of observational data in favor of the geocentric consensus. Tragically, if NBC had been around, the good Mr. Copernicus would not have been allowed to argue his case on \"Meet The Press.\"Ditto for that other notorious geocentric denier, Galileo Galilei. In the early seventeenth century even the Catholic Church \u2013 which had long since reconciled scripture with science\u2019s earth-centered consensus \u2013 condemned Galileo for his wayward thinking. Declaring that both science and scripture were settled, Pope Urban VIII\u2019s chief inquisitor sentenced the aged astronomer to house arrest \u2013 but only after shaming him into publicly recanting his denial of geocentricism.The list is long and sobering of examples in history where resolute scientific consensuses have been disproven. And, worse, disproven only after \u201cdeniers\u201d had been crushed and even destroyed for touting nonconforming interpretations of available evidence.\u00a0Altogether the lesson should be crystal clear: science \u2013 which I believe to be the most brilliant discipline we have for understanding the physical universe \u2013 is fallible and, therefore, always open to debate.The \"Meet The Press\u2019\" policy is pointedly and dangerously unscientific. And so are the calls by like-minded individuals to not just silence but punish anyone who dares to challenge the  of human-caused climate change \u2013 all allegedly in the name of science. \u201cI think that denying climate change is a crime against humanity,\u201d says comedian Eric Idle, not joking. \u201cAnd they should be held accountable in a World Court.\u201dBill Nye \u2013 another commentator, but with an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering \u2013 agrees, saying, \u201cthis extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen. So I can see where people are very concerned about this, and they\u2019re pursuing criminal investigations \u2026\u201d\u201cThe scientific consensus is in, and the argument is now over,\u201d proclaims actor Leonardo Di Caprio. \u201cIf you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts, or in science or empirical truths and therefore, in my humble opinion, should not be allowed to hold public office.\u201dAlbert Einstein once faced a similar kind of repulsive, benighted lynch mob. In his day, the scientific establishment resolutely believed that time and space were absolutes and cited as incontrovertible proof a vast literature of peer-reviewed, published studies. Collectively, mainstream scientists mocked Einstein\u2019s belief that space and time were relative \u2013 some calling it \u201cJewish science,\u201d a particularly hateful way of smearing the young space-time denier.Yet, as everyone now knows, Einstein \u2013 like Copernicus, Galileo, and scores of other vindicated \u201cdeniers\u201d over the centuries \u2013 ultimately disproved the vaunted scientific consensus.By all means, vet your guests carefully \u2013 avoid the uncredentialed nut jobs and purely political partisans. But, above all, heed Einstein\u2019s wise words about how science really works. \u201cNo amount of experimentation can ever prove me right,\u201d he observed, \u201ca single experiment can prove me wrong.\u201d", "headline": "Physicist: Don't fall for the argument about 'settled science'", "article_name": "physicist-dont-fall-for-the-argument-about-settled-science", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/physicist-dont-fall-for-the-argument-about-settled-science", "date_published": "2019-01-21 00:00:00", "article_length": 5049, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:04.477782"}

A problem that\u00a0O\u2019Rourke, among others, describes as an existential threat to mankind.

Harris, asked if we should get rid of plastic straws, responded\u00a0with\u00a0less then full-throated enthusiasm, and then got profoundly giggly as she described the difficulties\u00a0of\u00a0drinking from\u00a0paper alternatives. She\u00a0swiftly\u00a0shut it down,\u00a0realizing\u00a0that not a single person in the room\u00a0considered plastic straws\u00a0a laughing matter.Harris\u2019\u00a0impulse\u00a0is correct; straws are a footnote,\u00a0estimated to compose about 4 percent\u00a0of the\u00a0volume of\u00a0plastic waste going into our oceans. Because they weigh so little, their contribution to this type of trash is, by my calculation, 0.02 percent\u00a0of the 9 million tons of refuse deposited each year.If you really want to clean up the oceans, which is an excellent goal, how about getting rid of plastic bottles? That would make a real difference, but would mean a far bigger battle, since it involves a far bigger industry.\u00a0And, it might offend those\u00a0thirsty millennials whose\u00a0major\u00a0contribution to\u00a0fighting\u00a0climate change so far has been the introduction of the ever-present water bottle.A more productive approach would be to encourage\u00a0and fund\u00a0research on how to reuse or dissolve plastics.\u00a0That might mean working with Dow Chemical, a major plastics producer, which\u00a0has initiated a $1 billion\u00a0multi-firm effort\u00a0aimed at\u00a0developing new technologies and recycling efforts in order to reduce\u00a0plastic waste going into the oceans.But, that would mean having an open mind and a practical purpose. When Sanders and Warren screech about \u201cgreedy\u201d corporations, it makes it a little harder to engage those interests as partners. In any event, Democrats don\u2019t want partners, they want enemies, knowing that anger is one of\u00a0the biggest boosters to voter\u00a0turnout.The ferocity of\u00a0Hurricane\u00a0Dorian fed the\u00a0recent hysteria, of course, with zealots warning\u00a0that\u00a0big-weather\u00a0events\u00a0are\u00a0more frequent\u00a0today than in the past, thanks to global\u00a0warming. It isn\u2019t true.The incidence of hurricanes\u00a0has not increased in\u00a0modern\u00a0times; we are just keeping better track.\u00a0An analysis by scientists working with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, a\u00a0contributor to the\u00a0Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u202freveals that \u201cbased on careful examination of the Atlantic tropical storm database (HURDAT) and on estimates of how many storms were likely missed in the past, it is likely that the increase in Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane frequency in HURDAT since the late-1800s is primarily due to improved monitoring.\u201dThough the last few years have seen a number of powerful storms,\u00a0the average number of landfalls\u00a0in the U.S. each year between\u00a02006 through 2015 was a record low for any decade going back to 1850.\u00a0Of the\u00a0years suffering the most major\u00a0hurricanes, only one has occurred\u00a0in the past two decades\u00a0since 2000; the worst ever was 1950.But, facts don\u2019t matter. Anyone who questions\u00a0Sanders\u2019s claim that, \u201cHurricane Dorian has everything to do with climate change, which is the existential threat of our time\u201d is written off as a \u201cdenier.\u201d Anyone who wants to continue eating cheeseburgers is a Neanderthal and if you think that natural gas has been essential to our country\u2019s reduced emissions in recent years, you\u2019re an idiot.Democrats\u00a0want to\u00a0\u201cown\u201d\u00a0climate change; they are convinced that their hyperventilation will win over millennial\u00a0voters, an increasingly large share of the electorate.

China is now by far the No. 1 carbon dioxide polluter, followed by the United States and India.  (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File) If the world doesn't cut pollution of heat-trapping gases, the already noticeable harms of global warming could spiral \"out of control,\" the head of a United Nations scientific panel warned Monday.And he's not alone. The Obama White House says it is taking this new report as a call for action, with Secretary of State John Kerry saying \"the costs of inaction are catastrophic.\"Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that issued the 32-volume, 2,610-page report here early Monday, told The Associated Press: \"it is a call for action.\" Without reductions in emissions, he said, impacts from warming \"could get out of control.\"One of the study's authors, Maarten van Aalst, a top official at the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said, \"If we don't reduce greenhouse gases soon, risks will get out of hand. And the risks have already risen.\"Twenty-first century disasters such as killer heat waves in Europe, wildfires in the United States, droughts in Australia and deadly flooding in Mozambique, Thailand and Pakistan highlight how vulnerable humanity is to extreme weather, according to the report from the Nobel Prize-winning group of scientists. The dangers are going to worsen as the climate changes even more, the report's authors said.\"We're now in an era where climate change isn't some kind of future hypothetical,\" said the overall lead author of the report, Chris Field of the Carnegie Institution for Science in California. \"We live in an area where impacts from climate change are already widespread and consequential.\"Nobody is immune, Pachauri and other scientists said.\"We're all sitting ducks,\" Princeton University professor Michael Oppenheimer, one of the main authors of the report, said in an interview.After several days of late-night wrangling, more than 100 governments unanimously approved the scientist-written 49-page summary -- which is aimed at world political leaders. The summary mentions the word \"risk\" an average of about 5 1/2 times per page.\"Changes are occurring rapidly and they are sort of building up that risk,\" Field said.These risks are both big and small, according to the report. They are now and in the future. They hit farmers and big cities. Some places will have too much water, some not enough, including drinking water. Other risks mentioned in the report involve the price and availability of food, and to a lesser and more qualified extent some diseases, financial costs and even world peace.\"Things are worse than we had predicted\" in 2007, when the group of scientists last issued this type of report, said report co-author Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development at the Independent University in Bangladesh. \"We are going to see more and more impacts, faster and sooner than we had anticipated.\"The problems have gotten so bad that the panel had to add a new and dangerous level of risks. In 2007, the biggest risk level in one key summary graphic was \"high\" and colored blazing red. The latest report adds a new level, \"very high,\" and colors it deep purple.You might as well call it a \"horrible\" risk level, said van Aalst: \"The horrible is something quite likely, and we won't be able to do anything about it.\"The report predicts that the highest level of risk would first hit plants and animals, both on land and the acidifying oceans.Climate change will worsen problems that society already has, such as poverty, sickness, violence and refugees, according to the report. And on the other end, it will act as a brake slowing down the benefits of a modernizing society, such as regular economic growth and more efficient crop production, it says.\"In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans,\" the report says.And if society doesn't change, the future looks even worse, it says: \"Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts.\"While the problems from global warming will hit everyone in some way, the magnitude of the harm won't be equal, coming down harder on people who can least afford it, the report says. It will increase the gaps between the rich and poor, healthy and sick, young and old, and men and women, van Aalst said.But the report's authors say this is not a modern day version of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Much of what they warn of are more nuanced troubles that grow by degrees and worsen other societal ills. The report also concedes that there are uncertainties in understanding and predicting future climate risks.The report, the fifth on warming's impacts, includes risks to the ecosystems of the Earth, including a thawing Arctic, but it is far more oriented to what it means to people than past versions.The report also notes that one major area of risk is that with increased warming, incredibly dramatic but ultra-rare single major climate events, sometimes called tipping points, become more possible with huge consequences for the globe. These are events like the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which would take more than 1,000 years.\"I can't think of a better word for what it means to society than the word `risk,\"' said Virginia Burkett of the U.S. Geological Survey, one of the study's main authors. She calls global warming \"maybe one of the greatest known risks we face.\"Global warming is triggered by heat-trapping gases, such as carbon dioxide, that stay in the atmosphere for a century. Much of the gases still in the air and trapping heat came from the United States and other industrial nations. China is now by far the No. 1 carbon dioxide polluter, followed by the United States and India.Unlike in past reports, where the scientists tried to limit examples of extremes to disasters that computer simulations can attribute partly to man-made warming, this version broadens what it looks at because it includes the larger issues of risk and vulnerability, van Aalst said.Freaky storms like 2013's Typhoon Haiyan, 2012's Superstorm Sandy and 2008's ultra-deadly Cyclone Nargis may not have been caused by warming, but their fatal storm surges were augmented by climate change's ever rising seas, he said.And in the cases of the big storms like Haiyan, Sandy and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the poor were the most vulnerable, Oppenheimer and van Aalst said. The report talks about climate change helping create new pockets of poverty and \"hotspots of hunger\" even in richer countries, increasing inequality between rich and poor.Report co-author Maggie Opondo of the University of Nairobi said that especially in places like Africa, climate change and extreme events mean \"people are going to become more vulnerable to sinking deeper into poverty.\" And other study authors talked about the fairness issue with climate change.\"Rich people benefit from using all these fossil fuels,\" University of Sussex economist Richard Tol said. \"Poorer people lose out.\"Huq said he had hope because richer nations and people are being hit more, and \"when it hits the rich, then it's a problem\" and people start acting on it.Part of the report talks about what can be done: reducing carbon pollution and adapting to and preparing for changing climates with smarter development.The report echoes an earlier U.N. climate science panel that said if greenhouse gases continue to rise, the world is looking at another about 6 or 7 degrees Fahrenheit (3.5 or 4 degrees Celsius) of warming by 2100 instead of the international goal of not allowing temperatures to rise more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius). The difference between those two outcomes, Princeton's Oppenheimer said, \"is the difference between driving on an icy road at 30 mph versus 90 mph. It's risky at 30, but deadly at 90.\"Tol, who is in the minority of experts here, had his name removed from the summary because he found it \"too alarmist,\" harping too much on risk.But the panel vice chairman, Jean-Pascal \u00a0van Ypersele, said that's not quite right: \"We are pointing for reasons for alarm ... It's because the facts and the science and the data show that there are reasons to be alarmed. It's not because we're alarmist.\"The report is based on more than 12,000 peer reviewed scientific studies. Michel Jarraud, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, a co-sponsor of the climate panel, said this report was \"the most solid evidence you can get in any scientific discipline.\"Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University who wasn't part of this report, said he found the report \"very conservative\" because it is based on only peer reviewed studies and has to be approved unanimously.There is still time to adapt to some of the coming changes and reduce heat-trapping emissions, so it's not all bad, said study co-author Patricia Romero-Lankao of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado.\"We have a closing window of opportunity,\" she said. \"We do have choices.

The new study showed that there is now even more evidence that  are harming human health and welfare. The investigation also found an additional four areas, not listed in the original report, in which greenhouse gases threaten people.\"There's absolutely no scientific basis for questioning the Endangerment Finding,\" review lead researcher Philip Duffy, president and executive director of the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts, told Live Science. \"The case for endangerment is stronger than ever.\" []The original Endangerment Finding was a long time in the making. It began when Massachusetts and other states sued the EPA during President George W. Bush's administration, asking the agency to regulate greenhouse gases. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that not only does the EPA have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, but it also can't refuse to do so if these pollutants are found to endanger people.\"The Supreme Court said 'if you determine that greenhouse gases are dangerous, then you have to regulate them,'\" Duffy said. \"But, of course, the Supreme Court wasn't itself going to say whether greenhouse gases are dangerous.  not a legal one. So, the EPA undertook the scientific assessment of the dangerousness or not-dangerousness of greenhouse gases.\"In December 2009, the EPA released that report, which found that greenhouse gases do endanger human health and welfare by causing climate change. The administration of President Barack Obama used this finding to implement new regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan and stronger vehicle mileage standards for cars and light trucks, Duffy said.But now, people in and out of President Donald Trump's administration have discussed overturning or revisiting the endangerment finding, Duffy said. In response to these statements, Duffy and his colleagues decided to look at scientific studies published since the endangerment finding came out, to see whether the  the case for endangerment.The new review grouped the findings into different categories: public health, air quality, agriculture, forests, water resources, sea level rise, infrastructure and wildlife. The four new categories include ocean acidification, national security, economic well-being and violence. Here are more in-depth looks at several of them.People in more than 200 U.S. cities have an increased risk of premature death because of future warming, the researchers found. Extreme heat is linked with sleep loss, kidney stones, low birth weight, violence and suicide. Exposure to ozone and other air pollutants, including smoke from forest fires, can be bad for human health. Extreme weather events intensified by climate change can lead to physical trauma, disease outbreaks, interruption of health care delivery and mental health problems. Rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels are also increasing the , which affects people with allergies. Certain crops are expected to produce fewer nutrients. Population displacement and armed conflict can also amplify risks to human health. []With less snowpack in the mountains, the West and Southwest may experience more droughts. Reduced snowpack can lead to reduced river flow, which can threaten rare and endangered species, such as salmon and wolverines. Climate change is also expected to erode water quality in the United States because of nutrient loading (such as from fertilizer or animal waste), especially in the Midwest and Northeast. will increase the risk to coastal communities, economies and infrastructure, largely because of flooding, erosion and extreme events. These effects can lead to displacement through \"climate gentrification,\" in which people living at higher elevations have higher-priced properties. The movement of goods among major port cities will likely be affected, too, causing economic disruptions. Sea level rise may also disrupt the U.S. military, as well as disaster and humanitarian relief efforts.The United States' existing security will likely need to change as the planet warms. For example, in the Arctic, reduced sea ice will clear the way for more Chinese trade routes and Russian oil and , possibly causing tensions between these countries and the U.S., the researchers wrote.An increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) over 75 years is expected to permanently reduce U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by about 3 percent. The U.S. GDP is expected to be about 4 percent greater if warming is limited to 2.7 degrees F (1.5 degrees C) than if it's 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) above pre-industrial levels. Economies in poorer countries are expected to have an economic burden from climate change that is about five times larger than that of wealthier counties, the researchers found.Rising temperatures and increased rainfall can . In the U.S., higher temperatures are associated with higher rates of domestic violence, rape, assault and murder. Warmer periods may also elevate the risk of self-harm, including suicide, emerging evidence suggests.These findings \"highlight this contrast between the science and the policies,\" Duffy said. \"The scientific evidence is going in one direction, and the policies are going in exactly the opposite direction.\"But this report shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, said Jason Smerdon, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in New York, who wasn't involved with the review.\"If you've been paying attention, the Endangerment Finding in 2009 was very well-reasoned, and  since that time,\" Smerdon told Live Science. \"It's basically a tsunami of evidence in support of the fact. People have very clearly connected the changing climate, which we're causing, to the downstream impacts.\"The review also drives home that climate change will affect everybody, not just people in distant lands.\"Reports like this all point out that every one of us will be impacted by climate change in different ways, and it's going to be in all of our backyards,\" Smerdon said. \"It's not something that's going to be far away.\"The review was published online yesterday (Dec. 13) in the journal .", "headline": "Mountain of evidence confirms: Climate change is really, really bad for human health and well-being", "article_name": "mountain-of-evidence-confirms-climate-change-is-really-really-bad-for-human-health-and-well-being", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/mountain-of-evidence-confirms-climate-change-is-really-really-bad-for-human-health-and-well-being", "date_published": "2018-12-14 00:00:00", "article_length": 6578, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:09.109355"}

Is that an environmental way to travel?\"\n      John Kerry speaking at the ceremony in 2019.\n      Kerry responded by claiming that it was the only way.\u00a0 \"If you offset your carbon -- it's the only choice\u00a0for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle,\" Kerry said.\"I negotiated the Paris Accords for the United States,\" he added, referring to the multilateral climate agreement signed while he was secretary of state under President Obama.\"I've been involved with this fight for years. I negotiated with [Chinese] President Xi to bring President Xi to the table so we could get Paris. And, I believe, the time it takes me to get somewhere, I can't sail across the ocean. I have to fly, meet with people\u00a0and get things done,\" Kerry said, sidestepping the fact that he chose a private jet over a commercial flight.\u00a0\"But, what I'm doing, almost full time,\" he continued,\u00a0\"is working to win the battle on climate change, and in the end, if I offset and contribute my life to do this, I'm not going to be put on the defensive.\"Private jets have been estimated to emit\u00a0\u00a0as much carbon per passenger\u00a0as commercial flights.It's unclear how Kerry has been offsetting his carbon output, as he claimed, but flight logs indicated that his family's private jet spent over 20 hours in the air over the past year -- culminating in an estimated  of carbon emissions.\u00a0For comparison,\u00a0a March 2018 report from\u00a0\u00a0estimated that the typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. That calculation assumed a car that drives around 11,500 miles per year with a fuel economy of about 22.0 miles per gallon.The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News'\u00a0request for comment.As Fox News previously noted, the Kerry family owned a private charter jet company from which the longtime Democrat\u00a0appeared to benefit financially.\u00a0As late as 2013, his executive branch personnel financial disclosure\u00a0\u00a0Kerry owning \"over\u00a0$1,000,001\"\u00a0in assets\u00a0for the charter company Flying Squirrel LLC\u00a0through his wife Teresa Heinz\u00a0Kerry, heir to the Heinz ketchup\u00a0fortune.Kerry's financial disclosures from 2009-2012 also showed that amount. In his 2013 disclosure, the former secretary of state\u00a0reported between \"$50,001-$100,000\" in rent and royalties for the company. That figure was over $1 million in his 2012 form and between $100,001-$1,000,000 for 2013.\u00a0Other disclosures showed rental income of over $1 million for 2011, \"$100,001-$1,000,000\" for 2010, and \"$100,001-$1,000,000\" for 2008.Revelations about Kerry's outsized carbon footprint came as Democrats have considered proposals to overhaul the nation's energy economy, with potentially\u00a0\u00a0for households and individual Americans.Biden's climate\u00a0proposal is estimated to cost at least $1.7 trillion. That could grow, however, depending on how\u00a0Democrats negotiate with him in Congress, where progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0have been adamant about passing\u00a0the ambitious Green New Deal.During the campaign, Biden said he would use the Green New Deal as a framework\u00a0for his climate plan, although his proposal cost significantly less than other plans that adopted that framework. Regardless, Biden's plan aims for the type of economy-wide transformation advocated by more left-leaning members of his party.That included achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, which the Heritage Foundation has said would cost the economy millions of jobs, thousands of dollars in lost household income, and trillions erased from the nation's gross domestic product.The conservative nonprofit used the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) National Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0Not only did the model crash, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the GND.\u00a0The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58% reduction in emissions, achieved through\u00a0a $300 carbon tax\u00a0\u00a0-- taxes above $300\u00a0crashed the EIA's model.It estimated that just a 58% reduction would, by 2040,\u00a0cost the economy $15 trillion in lost gross domestic product and\u00a0an average of 1.1 million jobs per year. The average family of four would also see a total income loss of $165,000, or nearly $8,000 each year.Within just weeks of assuming power, the Biden administration had already cost American jobs by revoking the federal permit for constructing the Keystone XL pipeline. , the company that owns the pipeline, warned on Inauguration Day that doing so would \"directly lead to the layoff of thousands of union workers.\" Rob Darden, CEO at\u00a0, similarly \u00a0completing the pipeline \"would have created 10,000 good-paying American union jobs.\"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and\u00a0\u00a0D-N.Y., maintain that the cost of inaction on climate change\u00a0is unsustainable. According to Sanders, solutions like infrastructure and investment would boost the U.S. economy as well. Biden's campaign website predicted his climate response could create 10 million \"well-paying jobs.\"Sanders previously warned\u00a0that without action on climate change, the U.S. would\u00a0\"lose $34.5 trillion by the end of the century.\" He also predicted savings as high as $70.4 trillion over 80 years by \"averting climate catastrophe.\"Sam Dorman is a reporter with Fox News.

{"id": null, "body": "For too long, the  in Washington, D.C, has circled around who denies what and when the world may end. On Twitter and other social media, the debate has turned eating a hamburger or vegetable into a partisan argument. Climate change has become a polarizing, partisan topic. It shouldn\u2019t be.\u202fOn one hand, Republicans have done a poor job explaining how our free-market clean energy solutions are climate solutions. On the other hand, the  has seemingly aimed to out-radicalize itself every day with increasingly alarmist and unrealistic climate change proposals that stand no chance of becoming law.The Green New Deal, or most ideas from Democratic , only turn away necessary voices and push aside potential feasible policies. While science doesn\u2019t say\u00a0we only have 12 years\u00a0to save our climate, it\u2019s undeniable that humans impact our naturally ever-changing environment.So\u00a0what\u2019s a realistic policy? It won\u2019t come from one single piece of legislation, but from many free-market solutions that unleash American ingenuity and leadership. It\u2019s these solutions that create jobs, clean up the environment for future generations, and build consensus around the common ground to care for the world around us.\u202fTake, for example, Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT). It\u2019s a clean building product that proves innovation is how we can combat climate change, grow the economy, and raise our standard of living. It emits fewer emissions to manufacture than other tall building products and acts as a carbon-capture product. It\u2019s\u00a0estimated\u00a0that the use of CLT and other mass timber for the construction of tall buildings could reduce emissions\u00a0by up to 20 percent. It will also\u00a0stimulate economic growth\u00a0in America\u2019s rural, timber-dependent communities.Congresswoman Rodgers\u00a0has also prioritized\u00a0hydropower as a source of clean energy for her\u00a0district, promoted carbon-neutral biomass, and helped mitigate catastrophic forest fires that contribute to climate change. She has\u00a0also led on streamlining relicensing processes to spur the development of clean energy\u00a0resources and passed bipartisan legislation to encourage the use of small conduit hydropower projects to diversify our clean energy portfolio.\u00a0Last Congress, she\u00a0introduced a bill that focused on modernizing hydropower\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which powers 70\u00a0percent\u00a0of Washington state\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and it passed in the House with strong bipartisan support.On\u00a0the grassroots side, the American Conservation Coalition has built a presence on 180 college campuses nationwide, helped form the Republican Party\u2019s first bicameral environmentally-focused\u00a0caucus, and brought countless conservative students to Capitol Hill advocating for important climate and energy reforms.In September, we testified with Greta Thunberg before Congress on the importance of pragmatic climate change solutions. We\u2019re changing the narrative that conservatives don\u2019t care about the environment by building a strong base on these issues.The climate is changing. Humans and global industrial activity are contributing. Thankfully, there are realistic free-market solutions that will lead us in the right direction.For too long, this debate has centered\u00a0on\u00a0politicians pointing fingers to the other side. For Americans looking for solutions, it\u2019s an old and boring story \u2014 and we agree. It\u2019s time for something new and bold leadership on ideas that work.Climate change should no longer be partisan \u2014 or generational.The climate is changing. Humans and global industrial activity are contributing. Thankfully, there are realistic free-market solutions that will lead us in the right direction. Solutions like CLT and hydropower are already here, and there are more innovations to come that will ensure America leads on clean energy, creating jobs, keeping energy prices affordable, and reducing carbon emissions.\u202fWhy not promote what raises our standard of living today and helps us leave our home better off than we found it? With solutions and results that benefit everyone, that\u2019s a no-brainer. It\u2019s also far more productive than the time wasted on partisan talking points, especially when technology and innovation are already making a difference.This is a global problem, and it requires both parties leading on a global solution.\u00a0America led the world in the development of coal, oil and gas, and now we can lead the world in clean energy technology.", "headline": "Rep.

Six Neanderthals who lived in what is now France were eaten by their fellow Neanderthals some 100,000 years ago, according to gruesome evidence of the cannibalistic event discovered by scientists in a cave in the 1990s.Now, researchers may have figured out why the Neanderthals, including two children, became victims of cannibalism: global warming.While prior studies have interpreted Neanderthal remains to find\u00a0proof of cannibalistic behavior, this is the first study to offer clues as to what may have led Neanderthals to become cannibals. Scientists found that rapid shifts in local ecosystems as the planet warmed may have extinguished the animal species that Neanderthals ate, forcing them to look elsewhere to fill their bellies. []The researchers examined a layer of sediment in a cave known as Baume Moula-Guercy, in southeastern France. There, excavations in 1999 by another team of scientists had uncovered 120 Neanderthal bones from six individuals that showed signs\u00a0of being cannibalized.Later, in 2014, another group of researchers analyzed the cave deposits to a depth of 26 feet (8 meters), dividing them into 19 layers associated with three climate shifts. For the new study, the authors turned their attention to layer 15, a silty sediment layer about 16 inches (40 centimeters) thick, covering approximately 98 to 131 feet (30 to 40 m) of the cave floor.In that layer, charcoal and animal bones were so well-preserved that scientists could reconstruct an environmental snapshot representing 120,000 to 130,000 years ago. They discovered that the climate in the area was likely even warmer than it is today, and that the transition from a cold, arid climate to a warmer one happened quickly, \"maybe within a few generations,\" study co-author Emmanuel Desclaux, a research associate at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis in France, .As the animals that once populated the landscape vanished, some Neanderthals ate what they could find \u2014 their neighbors.Cannibalism is by no means exclusive to Neanderthals, and has been practiced by\u00a0humans and their relatives\u00a0\"from the early Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age and beyond,\" the study authors reported. The behavior adopted by the starving Neanderthals in the Baume Moula-Guercy should therefore not be viewed as \"a mark of bestiality or sub-humanity,\" but as an emergency adaptation to a period of severe environmental stress, according to the study.The findings were published online in the April issue of the\u00a0.", "headline": "Climate change drove some Neanderthals to cannibalism", "article_name": "climate-change-drove-some-neanderthals-to-cannibalism", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-drove-some-neanderthals-to-cannibalism", "date_published": "2019-04-04 00:00:00", "article_length": 2654, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:15.500290"}
{"id": null, "body": "Ed Henry reports from Washington, D.C.Climate change is happening; the question is what to do about it. President Obama had one answer: reduce greenhouse-gas emissions aggressively.Unfortunately, his approach was heavy on cost and light on benefit, and with yesterday\u2019s  rolling back those efforts, President Trump has rightly begun the process of reversing it.But President Trump's own response to climate change appears to be: nothing. That\u2019s not the right answer either.Most climate policy falls into one of two categories: There is \u201cmitigation,\u201d which means trying to prevent climate change by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions -- think wind farms. And then there is \u201cadaptation,\u201d which means dealing well with whatever change occurs -- think sea walls.The basic problem with Obama\u2019s mitigation-focused approach is that the overwhelming majority of future emissions will come from the developing world as it grows rapidly. U.S. policy has  to influence that trend, even when we make brave commitments to incur large costs ourselves.We can -- and should -- invest in developing new technologies that might reduce emissions more cheaply, but that takes time, and success is not guaranteed.Without major mitigation, though, adaptation becomes all the more important. And that  a place where good American policy can make a major difference.For instance, continued research into the likely effects of climate change can inform policymakers and private actors about what to expect, so that they can make better investments.If certain areas of the country are likely to get wetter or drier, hotter or colder, we should want to know that. Yet the Trump Administration seems inclined -- at least so far -- to dismiss such research and cut its funding as aggressively as possible.The instinct is understandable, given the research sloppily conducted or misappropriated for activist ends under the previous Administration.The Obama-era EPA's \u201cClimate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis\u201d project, for example,\u00a0 that the rate of heat-related deaths for New York in the year 2100 would be 50 times higher than it was for Phoenix in 2000 -- even though New York would be nowhere near as hot in 2100 as Phoenix is already.But that egregious effort does not make good research less valuable. It just underscores the need for research to be well focused and insulated from politics.Similarly, we should want government planners at every level to take the best existing research into account as they make public investments and set policy that will influence others.If farmers and resort owners and mayors and naval planners all , then those changes as they arrive won\u2019t be so harmful or expensive.Yet, in addition to starting the repeal of costly mitigation efforts like Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, Trump\u2019s executive order entirely erases an Obama order aimed at \u201c.\u201d Many of the points in that program still make sense.Perhaps the  made by those who overinflate the risk of climate change is to forget that our society has a tremendous capacity to adapt and innovate. But it would also be a major mistake to forget that public policy can either foster or hinder that process.If President Trump dislikes his predecessor\u2019s approach to adaptation he should put forward an alternative. Ignoring the problem entirely is one of the few things he can do that really would make it worse.", "headline": "Trump is wrong on climate change", "article_name": "trump-is-wrong-on-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-is-wrong-on-climate-change", "date_published": "2017-03-29 00:00:00", "article_length": 3362, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:15.979880"}

(Credit: NOAA) After climate change melts the Arctic Ocean's year-round ice cover, only the region's oldest, thickest ice will remain ... or will it? A new study offers a dire warning that even this ice is at risk.Known as the \"Last Ice Area,\" this icy zone extends more than 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) from Greenland's northern coast to the western part of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The enduring ice here is at least 5 years old \u2014 older than in neighboring regions \u2014 and measures about 13 feet (4 meters) thick.However, this older, more robust sea ice is not as stable as once thought, and it's vanishing much faster than expected. In fact, the Last Ice Area is disappearing about twice as rapidly as the Arctic's younger, thinner sea ice, researchers reported in a new study.Much of the ice in the western Arctic is \"first-year ice\" \u2014\u00a0ice that is no more than 1 year old, said lead study author Kent Moore, a physics professor with the University of Toronto Mississauga.\"The ice in the central Arctic is between 2 and 3 years old, and then the really old ice is in this Last Ice Area,\" Moore told Live Science.Sea ice cover in\u00a0\u00a0grows and shrinks with the seasons, but recent years have seen less and less widespread ice, during both winter and summer months. In 2019, Arctic sea ice reached its maximum on March 13, spanning around 6 million square miles (15 million square kilometers). That extent is actually lower than most of the 40 previous years,\u00a0\u00a0(NSIDC).Arctic sea ice cover for 2019 reached its lowest on Sept 18. At 1.6 million square miles (4 million square km), this coverage tied with 2007 and 2016 as the second lowest since the 1970s,\u00a0.The prognosis for Arctic ice in a warming world is grim. Climate models predict that most of the ice outside of the Last Ice Area could vanish for good within the next few decades, leaving the Last Ice Area as the sole refuge for marine life that depends on ice, such as seals,\u00a0\u00a0and algae, Moore said.\"By the year 2060, the Arctic will be what people define as being ice-free, which is an area of perennial ice less than 1 million square kilometers [386,102 square miles]. And much of that ice will be in the Last Ice Area,\" he explained.This ice was long thought to be fairly stationary, accumulating without much loss and locked in a location where it was undisturbed by wind and\u00a0. For the first time, scientists looked at the Last Ice Area using a model that reproduced the local ice cycle, incorporating satellite and atmospheric data from 1979 to 2018. The study authors found that the region was far more dynamic than previously suspected, and huge amounts of ice were being carried away into the ocean.\"What we found is from year to year, the ice thickness can change by about 1 meter [3 feet],\" Moore said. On average, ice thickness is about 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 m), but in some years it was less than 10 feet (3 m) and in other years it was greater than 16 feet (5 m). And when the ice becomes thinner \u2014 which is happening more frequently \u2014 it's easier for winds to carry it away, the scientists reported in the study.They also learned that this area was thinning\u00a0\u00a0when compared with the rest of the Arctic. Since the late 1970s, two locations have seen their ice thickness drop by about 5 feet (2 m), the researchers wrote.\"We still don't know exactly why, but it's probably because the ice is now more mobile, and so it's able to leave this area more easily than it was in the past,\" Moore said.Climate change is heating things up in the Arctic at a rate that is unmatched anywhere else in the world. In June, the average temperature in the Arctic was\u00a0\u00a0by nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 degrees Celsius). Because climate models until now have likely underestimated ice loss from the Last Ice Area, it's possible that the Arctic will reach an ice-free state even more quickly than predicted, the study authors warned. And if Earth continues to warm, even the Last Ice Area won't stay frozen for much longer, Moore said.\"Eventually we'll lose ice in this region as well, if we don't get our use of carbon under control in the next few years,\" he said. \"We're going to pass a point where we won't be able to sustain these ecosystems, if the ice loss persists through the latter half of this century.\"The findings were published online Oct. 15 in the journal\u00a0.", "headline": "The Arctic's most stable sea ice is vanishing alarmingly fast", "article_name": "the-arctics-most-stable-sea-ice-is-vanishing-alarmingly-fast", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/the-arctics-most-stable-sea-ice-is-vanishing-alarmingly-fast", "date_published": "2019-11-13 00:00:00", "article_length": 4418, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:16.616150"}

Unfortunately, we can\u2019t.But despite what you hear from environmental extremists \u2013 who oppose the use of oil, coal and natural gas \u2013 even if we stopped using these fossil fuels tomorrow hurricanes would still be part of our natural world. They always have been and always will be.Radical greens and their political and media allies have latched onto the suffering caused by Harvey and Irma to advance their ideological jihad against fossil fuels. They want to keep these valuable resources locked up underground and never used to provide the efficient, reliable and affordable energy that makes our economy and modern life possible.The extremists don\u2019t care that ending our use of fossil fuels would dramatically reduce our living standards by making energy much more scarce and expensive, or that the poor would suffer far more than the wealthy.My geology, ecology and natural resources background taught me that climate change has been \u201creal\u201d throughout our planet\u2019s history, including long before humans walked the Earth.Some on the left are also using Harvey and Irma as yet another weapon in their non-stop attacks on President Trump, his administration, Republicans and our very way of life.My geology, ecology and natural resources background taught me that climate change has been \u201creal\u201d throughout our planet\u2019s history, including long before humans walked the Earth. I\u2019ve studied climate change, spoken at length with dozens of renowned experts, and written numerous articles explaining climate, energy and environmental issues in lay terms.I\u2019ve learned to be humble, respectful and vigilant in the face of nature\u2019s power; to recognize that climate change can range from beneficial or benign to harmful or unbelievably destructive; and to understand that the sun and other powerful natural forces totally dwarf whatever meager powers humans might muster in attempting to control Earth\u2019s climate and weather.Hurricane Harvey marked the end of a record 12-year absence of Category 3 to 5 hurricanes hitting the U.S. mainland. If global warming was the reason our nation is being battered by major hurricanes this year, how do you explain their absence for the past dozen years? There hasn\u2019t been such a long period when the U.S. was free of major hurricanes since 1860 to 1869.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Hurricane Research Division counts ten Category 4 and 5 monster hurricanes in the U.S. between 1920 and 1969 \u2013 but only three between 1970 and 2016, when our planet was warming more rapidly. If warming causes more severe hurricanes, the number of big storms should have been greater in the latter period and fewer in the earlier part of the 20th century.If Harvey\u2019s rainfall was due to growing fossil fuel use and atmospheric carbon dioxide, how do you explain previous deluges like Hurricane Easy (45 inches in Florida in 1950), Tropical Cyclone Amelia (48 inches in Texas in 1978) and Tropical Storm Claudette (a record 43 inches in 24 hours on Alvin, Texas in 1979), when global fossil fuel use was much lower?Natural factors not affected by manmade climate change played a key role in enabling Harvey and Irma to strike with such devastating force.Consulting meteorologist Joe D\u2019Aleo notes that \u201churricanes entering Texas are almost always very wet and often stall or meander.\u201dWeatherBELL Analytics chief forecaster Joe Bastardi explains that a large (and predicted) cool trough trapped Harvey and kept it from moving inland, enabling the Gulf of Mexico to feed it trillions of gallons of water for days,It was \u201can unusual confluence of events,\u201d said Weather Channel founder John Coleman, \u201cbut it was certainly not unprecedented.\u201dIf there was a \u201chuman factor\u201d in Harvey and Irma, climate alarmists need to explain exactly where it was, how big it was and what role it played. They must present hard evidence to show that fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions played a significant role compared to the hundreds of natural forces involved in these storms. They have done none of these things and cannot.The Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico are warm enough every summer to produce major hurricanes, says climatologist Roy Spencer. But you also need other conditions that have unknown origins and mechanisms: pre-existing cyclonic circulation off the African coast, upper atmospheric calm, and sea surface temperatures that change on a cyclical basis in various regions, to name just a few.The combination of all these factors \u2013 plus weather fronts and land masses along the way \u2013 determines whether a hurricane arises, how strong it gets, how long it lasts and what track it follows.Damage from hurricanes has certainly increased over the years. But that\u2019s because far more people now live and work in far more homes and businesses in many expensive communities along America\u2019s Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Since 1920, Greater Houston grew from 138,000 people to 5.7 million; Miami from 43,000 to 6.1 million; Tampa from 50,000 to 3 million.Meanwhile, hurricane death tolls have declined dramatically over the years, despite much larger populations today in areas in the path of the storms. This is thanks in part to fossil fuels that enable us to construct stronger buildings; track storms; evacuate and rescue people; and bring in water, food, clothing, and materials to rebuild.Our Earth is a complex, wondrous, resilient planet. But it can unleash incredible fury. Wealthy, technologically advanced nations fueled by oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear power are far better able to avoid, survive and recover from those disasters.", "headline": "Don't blame climate change: Hurricanes have always been and will always be with us", "article_name": "dont-blame-climate-change-hurricanes-have-always-been-and-will-always-be-with-us", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dont-blame-climate-change-hurricanes-have-always-been-and-will-always-be-with-us", "date_published": "2017-09-18 00:00:00", "article_length": 6006, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:20.686725"}

The global climate is changing faster now than it has at any point in the past 2,000 years.That's the conclusion of a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0published July 24 in the journals Nature and Nature Geoscience that examined the global climate over the past two millennia. The researchers showed that none of the past fluctuations \u2014 that is, not the Little Ice Age, the warm period known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly or any other famous shift \u2014 had the global reach that modern climate change is having. Past fluctuations tended to be localized, affecting primarily one region at a time. Modern climate change, by contrast, is messing with the entire world.\"Temperatures did not rise and fall everywhere in step [in the past],\" editors wrote in an accompanying opinion piece in Nature Geoscience. \"Specifically, early cool or warm intervals that lasted for centuries peaked at different times in different regions.\"That's a radical departure from modern climate change, Scott St. George, a climate researcher at the University of Minnesota who wasn't involved in the research, wrote in a\u00a0\u00a0for Nature. []\"Although the Little Ice Age was the coldest epoch of the past millennium, the timing of the lowest temperatures varied from place to place,\" St. George wrote. \"Two-fifths of the planet were subjected to the coldest weather during the mid-nineteenth century, but the deepest chill occurred several centuries earlier in other regions. And even at the height of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, only 40% of Earth\"s surface reached peak temperatures at the same time. Using the same metrics, global warming today is unparalleled: for 98% of the planet's surface, the warmest period of the Common Era occurred in the late twentieth century.\"That means that almost every part of the planet had its hottest decades in the past 2,000 years at the same time.And the 21st century, which is outside the scope of these papers, has been\u00a0\u00a0so far. In fact, the world is on track to\u00a0\u00a0as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere.To develop a rigorous picture of global temperatures over the past 2,000 years, the researchers relied on nearly 700 records from the so-called PAGES 2k proxy temperature database. That database rounds up evidence from ice cores, trees, coral and other substances that change their appearance or chemical composition based on global temperatures. The researchers used those records to build a detailed map of climate fluctuations the world over. And none of them look like the consistent, persistent shifts we're seeing today.Of course, the causes are different, too. Evidence from the previous 2,000 years shows that short-lived volcanic events were the main drivers of climate fluctuations, the authors wrote. Human activities were perhaps a very minor secondary factor over that period. Now, humans are the ones driving the bus.

But now that he\u2019s taken his 538 blog to ESPN, his problems run deeper than just disgruntled partisans.A 538 piece by Colorado professor Roger Pielke that downplayed the impact of climate change has many in the global-warming crowd up in arms. The piece argued that while the cost of climate-related disasters is increasing, that\u2019s because of the growing wealth of the world population, not the burgeoning impact of climate change.Silver , saying: \u201cReception to the article ran about 80 percent negative in the comments section and on social media. A reaction like that compels us to think carefully about the piece and our editorial process.\u201cRoger\u2019s article also contained an implicit policy recommendation in its closing paragraph. Whether or not the recommendation was justified by Roger\u2019s thesis and evidence, we generally prefer to avoid these kind of recommendations, and instead allow readers to draw any policy conclusions for themselves. Furthermore, there was some loose language in the article. We pride ourselves on precise, matter-of-fact language. These things reflect a poor job of editing on our part.\u201dSilver says he is commissioning a rebuttal piece, but that \u201cthe turnaround will not be instantaneous\u201d\u2014a problem in the lightning-quick web world.\u201cPlease realize that you are using untruths to attack the reputation of someone who you know nothing about,\u201d he said by e-mail. \u201cIf you actually did some real reporting you might be surprised at what you find.\u201d\"Roger is a freelance contributor and his private communications do not represent FiveThirtyEight,\" Silver said in a statement to HuffPost. \"We had candid conversations with Michael Mann and Kevin Trenberth. We made clear that Roger's conversations with them did not reflect FiveThirtyEight's editorial values.\"To make matters worse, Silver\u2019s guy got into a dustup with two climate scientists, Michael Mann and Kevin Trenberth. Mann told the liberal group Think Progress that Pielke\u2019s article was \u201cdeeply misleading, confirming some of my worst fears that Nate Silver\u2019s new venture may become yet another outlet for misinformation when it comes to the issue of human-caused climate change.\u201dThat prompted Pielke to send a toughly letter to the two scientists that they regarded as threatening.

There\u2019s little spark and almost nothing in there that compels me to check it regularly.Silver has been trash-talking the media, calling most major op-ed columnists purveyors of crap, clearly suggesting that he can do far better.Silver seemed to realize he had jacked up expectations too high during a \u201cDaily Show\u201d appearance last week:\u201cWell, here's the thing: Maybe on programs like this, there was a lot of hype about me and about FiveThirtyEight--\u201d\u201cI called you the Lord of the Algorithm!\u201d Stewart said.\u201cYeah, and that was useful for book sales at the time, but right now it kind of sets a very high bar.\u201dA bar that, so far at least, Nate Silver isn\u2019t clearing.When liberal HBO host Bill Maher brought up Paul Ryan's recent remarks on inner-city causes of poverty, you might have thought he was going to join in the misguided attack that the former VP candidate was being racist.Especially when Maher read this quote:\"When it comes to getting an education, too many of our young people can\u2019t be bothered.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) A warmer world makes for nastier hurricanes. Scientists say they are wetter, possess more energy and intensify faster.Their storm surges are more destructive because climate change has already made the seas rise. And lately, the storms seem to be stalling more often and thus dumping more rain.Study after study shows that climate change in general makes hurricanes worse. But determining the role of global warming in a specific storm such as Hurricane Florence or Typhoon Mangkhut is not so simple \u2014 at least not without detailed statistical and computer analyses.The Associated Press consulted with 17 meteorologists and scientists who study climate change, hurricanes or both. A few experts remain cautious about attributing global warming to a single event, but most of the scientists clearly see the hand of humans in Florence.Global warming didn't cause Florence, they say. But it makes the system a bigger danger.\"Florence is yet another poster child for the human-supercharged storms that are becoming more common and destructive as the planet warms,\" said Jonathan Overpeck, dean of the environment school at University of Michigan. He said the risk extends beyond the Atlantic Ocean, such as Typhoon Mangkhut, which hit the Philippines on Friday.For years, when asked about climate change and specific weather events, scientists would refrain from drawing clear connections. But over the past few years, the new field of attribution studies has allowed researchers to use statistics and computer models to try to calculate how events would be different in a world without human-caused climate change.A couple of months after Hurricane Harvey, studies found that global warming significantly increased the odds for Harvey's record heavy rains.\"It's a bit like a plot line out of 'Back to the Future,' where you travel back in time to some alternate reality\" that is plausible but without humans changing the climate, said University of Exeter climate scientist Peter Stott, one of the pioneers of the field.A National Academy of Sciences report finds these studies generally credible. One team of scientists tried to do a similar analysis for Florence, but outside experts were wary because it was based on forecasts, not observations, and did not use enough computer simulations.As the world warms and science advances, scientists get more specific, even without attribution studies. They cite basic physics, the most recent research about storms and past studies and put them together for something like Florence.\"I think we can say that the storm is stronger, wetter and more impactful from a coastal flooding standpoint than it would have been BECAUSE of human-caused warming,\" Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann wrote in an email. \"And we don't need an attribution study to tell us that in my view. We just need the laws of thermodynamics.\"Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb looks not just at basic physics but all the peer-reviewed studies that especially link climate change to wetter storms.\"We have solid data across decades of rainfall records to nail the attribution \u2014 climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme rainfall events,\" Cobb said.Several factors make scientists more confident in pointing the climate-change finger at Florence.For every degree the air warms, it can hold nearly 4 percent more water (7 percent per degree Celsius) and offer measurably more energy to goose the storm, scientists said.\"The amount of water that comes out of hurricanes is certainly the most robust connection that we have,\" National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate scientist Jim Kossin said.And to look at Florence specifically, \"it's very likely that climate change has warmed the ocean such that the hurricane's intense rainfall is more destructive than without global warming,\" said Weather Underground Meteorology Director Jeff Masters, a former hurricane hunter.The warmer air and water also makes storms more intense or stronger, Stott said.A Kossin study this year showed that tropical cyclones \u2014 a category that includes hurricanes and typhoons \u2014 are moving slower and even stalling. Kossin said \"it's happening a lot more than it used to.\" Several studies agree that climate change is to blame but differ slightly in their conclusions.With the emergence of Florence, some place in the U.S. has been drenched because of a stalled hurricane for four years in a row, storm surge expert Hal Needham said.Kossin and Overpeck also pointed to studies that show storms are intensifying more rapidly than they used to.Just like in Superstorm Sandy, scientists said it is clear that hurricane storm surge is worsened by sea level rise because the power of 6 to 10 feet of water comes on top of seas that were considerably lower decades ago. An extra 8 inches or so can mean the difference between staying dry or getting damaged, Masters said.In the Carolinas, natural and temporary climate factors added to the \"march upwards\" from global warning. Because of that, the seas have risen nearly 5 inches in five years, said Andrea Dutton of the University of Florida.Meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com cautioned that observers should \"stick to overall trends around the world and not individual cases.\"University of Miami hurricane expert Brian McNoldy said there are too many ever-changing factors that make it hard to blame climate change specifically.\"If you are trying to make climate policy,\" Maue said Friday, \"you don't want to make it on a storm-by-storm basis.\"___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

It opened a year late, reached just five percent of its anticipated audience and likely fell short of its ambitious goal of informing a new generation about the perceived dangers of man-caused climate change.Plus, it apparently wasn't very good.\u201cDespite fine performances, the musical mystery tour is an uneasy mix of fact and credulity-stretching fiction.

But it stalled after a single production in Kansas City, falling short of the lofty goals outlined in a grant proposal. It was envisioned as a chance to create \"an experience that would be part investigative journalism and part inventive theater,\u201d help the public \"better appreciate how science studies the Earth\u2019s biosphere\u201d and increase \u201cpublic awareness, knowledge and engagement with science-related societal issues.\u201dAccording to a plot description on the theater company\u2019s , \"The Great Immensity\" focuses on a woman named Phyllis as she tries to track down a friend who disappeared while filming an assignment for a nature show on a tropical island. During her search, she also uncovers a devious plot surrounding an international climate summit in Auckland, New Zealand.The description touts the play as \u201ca thrilling and timely production\u201d with \u201ca highly theatrical look into one of the most vital questions of our time: How can we change ourselves and our society in time to solve the enormous environmental challenges that confront us?\u201dRep.

{"id": null, "body": "\n        The Capitol Dome is seen behind the Capitol Power Plant in Washington, Monday, June 24, 2013. The plant provides power to buildings in the Capitol Complex. President Obama will announce Tuesday he is planning to sidestep Congress to implement a national plan to combat climate change that will include the first-ever federal regulations on carbon dioxide emitted by existing power plants, despite adamant opposition from Republicans and some energy producers.In a speech at Georgetown University Tuesday, Obama will announce he's issuing a presidential memorandum to implement the regulations, meaning none of the steps involved in the plan will require congressional approval.In addition, Obama will say he is directing his administration to allow enough renewables on public lands to power 6 million homes by 2020, effectively doubling the capacity from solar, wind and geothermal projects on federal property.Obama also was to announce $8 billion in federal loan guarantees to spur investment in technologies that can keep carbon dioxide produced by power plants from being released into the atmosphere.In taking action on his own, Obama is also signaling he will no longer wait for lawmakers to act on climate change, and instead will seek ways to work around them.The linchpin of Obama's plan, and the step activists say will have the most dramatic impact, involves limits on carbon emissions for new and existing power plants. The Obama administration has already proposed controls on new plants, but those controls have been delayed and not yet finalized.Tuesday's announcement will be the first public confirmation that Obama plans to extend carbon controls to coal-fired power plants that are currently pumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.\"This is the holy grail,\" said Melinda Pierce of Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group. \"That is the single biggest step he can take to help tackle carbon pollution.\"However, critics say that Obama's changes will create more problems for America's coal industry.\"This proposal will buttress an EPA proposed rule issued last year for new power plants that will essentially ban coal\u2019s use in the future,\" Tom Borelli, a senior fellow at FreedomWorks, told FoxNews.com.Forty percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, and one-third of greenhouse gases overall, come from electric power plants, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistical agency.Obama is expected to lay out a broad vision Tuesday, without detailed emission targets or specifics about how they will be put in place. Instead, the president will launch a process in which the Environmental Protection Agency will work with states to develop specific plans to rein in carbon emissions, with flexibility for each state's circumstances.Under one scenario envisioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, states could draw on measures such as clean energy sources, carbon-trapping technology and energy efficiency to reduce the total emissions released into the air.Heather Zichal, Obama's senior energy and climate adviser, told environmental groups Monday that Obama is working with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan on a target for renewable energy to be produced at federally assisted housing projects.She framed the Obama's efforts in the U.S. as part of a broader, global movement to combat climate change, trumpeting the role the U.S. can play in leading other nations to stem the warming of the planet.Paul Bledsoe, who worked on climate issues in the Clinton White House, said Zichal renewed a pledge Obama made in in his first year in office, during global climate talks in Copenhagen, to cut U.S. carbon emissions by about 17 percent by 2020, compared to 2005 levels.\"This is a policy fulfillment of what the president has been talking about and trying to accomplish for five years or more,\" said Bledsoe, now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.One key issue Obama is not expected to address Tuesday is Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry oil extracted from tar sands in western Canada to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast. A concerted campaign by environmental activists to persuade Obama to nix the pipeline as a \"carbon bomb\" appears to have gained little traction. The oil industry has been urging the president to approve the pipeline, citing jobs and economic benefits.Obama raised climate change as a key second-term issue in his inaugural address in January, but has offered few details since. In his February State of the Union, he issued an ultimatum to lawmakers: \"If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.\"The poor prospects for getting any major climate legislation through a Republican-controlled House were on display last week when Speaker John Boehner responded to the prospect that Obama would put forth controls on existing power plants by deeming the idea \"absolutely crazy.\"\"Why would you want to increase the cost of energy and kill more American jobs?\" said Boehner, R-Ohio, echoing the warnings of some industry groups.Sidestepping Congress by using executive action doesn't guarantee Obama smooth sailing. Lawmakers could introduce legislation to thwart Obama's efforts. And the rules for existing power plants will almost certainly face legal challenges in court. The Supreme Court has upheld the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, but how the EPA goes about that effort remains largely uncharted waters.Even if legal and political obstacles are overcome, it will take years for the new measures to be put in place, likely running up against the end of Obama's presidency or even beyond it. White House aides say that's one reason Obama is ensuring the process starts now, while there are still more than three years left in his final term.Under the process outlined in the Clean Air Act, the EPA cannot act unilaterally, but must work with states to develop the standards, said Jonas Monast, an attorney who directs the climate and energy program at Duke University. An initial proposal will be followed by a months-long public comment period before the EPA can issue final guidance to states. Then the states must create actual plans for plants within their borders, a process likely to take the better part of a year.Then the EPA has another four months to decide whether to approve each state's plan before the implementation period can start.", "headline": "Obama planning to sidestep Congress for next phase in climate change agenda", "article_name": "obama-planning-to-sidestep-congress-for-next-phase-in-climate-change-agenda", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/obama-planning-to-sidestep-congress-for-next-phase-in-climate-change-agenda", "date_published": "2015-12-21 00:00:00", "article_length": 6511, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:30.934454"}
{"id": null, "body": "\n         Want to help save the world from climate change? Then grab some seeds, or some seedlings, and start planting trees like there's no tomorrow.At least 1 trillion of them, and fast.That may sound like a lot of trees, but the Earth has room for their gnarled bows and branches. In a new study that excluded cities and agricultural areas, researchers found that the planet has nearly 3.5 million square miles (9 million square kilometers) to spare for trees. Such newly planted trees could cut carbon (a part of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere by nearly 25%, bringing it down to levels not seen for nearly 100 years, the scientists said. []The study shows where in the world these trees could be planted, and how much carbon they could store. (Trees take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it in a process called\u00a0, which allows them to grow, ultimately storing that carbon in their leaves and other parts.) Russia has the most space at 583,000 square miles (1.5 million square km), followed by the United States at 397,700 square miles (1 million square km), the researchers found. The next top contenders are Canada with 302,700 square miles (784,000 square km), Australia with 223,900 square miles (578,900 square km), Brazil with 191,900 square miles (497,000 square km), and China with 155,200 square miles (402,000 square km) available for\u00a0.In all, this area is equal to about the size of the United States.\"We all knew restoring forests could play a part in tackling climate change, but we had no scientific understanding of what impact this could make,\" study senior author Thomas Crowther, an assistant professor of ecology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich (ETH Zurich),\u00a0.The team's calculation \"shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today,\" Crowther added.Planting trees in these regions would increase Earth's forest-covered land by a third, all without affecting land humans use for cities and agriculture. Once these trees have matured, they could store 225 billion tons (205 billion metric tons) of carbon, or about two-thirds of the 330 billion tons (300 billion metric tons) of carbon that humans have released into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution began.The unfolding greenery could help limit\u00a0. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report found that adding an additional 3.8 million square miles (10 million square km) of forestland could limit climate change to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by 2050. But this number may change, as climate change factors tend to accelerate quickly, meaning that even more trees than the IPCC calculated in their report may be needed to achieve that goal, the researchers said.The Swiss team came up with their forecasts by using a dataset of nearly 80,000 forests and combining that with Google Earth Engine, which allowed them to make a predictive model of\u00a0.However, even if the trees are planted pronto, their effects won't be immediate.\"It will take decades for new forests to mature and achieve this potential,\" Crowther said. \"It is vitally important that we protect the forests that exist today, pursue other climate solutions and continue to phase out fossil fuels from our economies in order to avoid dangerous climate change.\"The study was published online yesterday (July 4) in the journal\u00a0.", "headline": "Want to fight climate change?

The seas warm more slowly than the air but trap the heat longer with bigger side effects \u2014 and the report links these waters with Earth's snow and ice, called the cryosphere, because their futures are interconnected.\"The world's oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades.

But there are physical, practical and economic limits to our embrace of renewable energy sources.Energy is required for everything humans do, and the more expensive it is, the more poverty will be exacerbated.Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., knows little if anything about climate science. She has come up with a plan that is the equivalent of amputating your leg to deal with an ingrown toenail. The \u201ccure\u201d is far more harmful than the problem it is designed to solve.Whether we like it or not, the world runs mostly on fossil fuels, which have the advantage of very large energy density and availability, day or night, even when the sun doesn\u2019t shine and the wind doesn\u2019t blow.Solar and wind energy are not free. They are only practical in limited regions, and they require huge diversions of funds to produce relatively small amounts of energy per acre of land and physical resources used.The intermittency of solar and wind energy causes instability and inefficiencies in the electric grid. Across European countries, the cost of electricity doubles for only a 25 percent reliance on wind and solar power.And, of course, air travel will likely always be dependent on fossil fuels due to their light weight and high energy density. You don\u2019t want the plane you are riding in to lose power when the sun goes down or on a cloudy day.It\u2019s legitimate to ask just how much future climate change would be averted if (for example) the world fully embraced the Paris Climate Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The answer is a virtually unmeasurable amount: global warming would be reduced by 0.17 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, even if the agreement\u2019s 2030 goal is extended for another 70 years.And that assumes computer projections of future warming are reliable. One 2018 study of ocean and atmospheric warming since the late 1800s found that climate models are overestimating global warming from increasing greenhouse gases by about a factor of two.And even that study assumed that 100 percent of the warming is humanity\u2019s fault. The alarmist U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change admits that the fraction of global warming caused by humans might not be much more than one-half, further reducing the threat of warming.And the Green New Deal calls for far greater changes than the Paris Climate Agreement does.James Hansen, the modern godfather of global warming theory, has admitted that only a widespread embrace of nuclear power can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the Green New Deal would eliminate nuclear power.All this points to simple fact: for now, fossil fuels are the moral choice. Mandated reliance on expensive solar and wind energy in the U.S. would make our lives much harder and would make energy much more expensive, hurting poor people the most. And there would be no measureable impact on global temperatures in our, or our grandchildren\u2019s, lifetimes.No one can say what the future will bring. Perhaps many years from now there will be monumental advances in solar and wind power and batteries to store such power, making it possible to rely on renewable energy for all our power needs.But this isn\u2019t not going to happen in time to meet the 10-year deadline the Green New Deal sets for complete reliance on renewable energy. Simply wishing for or mandating scientific advances will not make them take place.", "headline": "Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal wouldn\u2019t slow climate change, but your electricity costs would skyrocket", "article_name": "ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal-wouldnt-slow-climate-change-but-your-electricity-costs-would-skyrocket", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal-wouldnt-slow-climate-change-but-your-electricity-costs-would-skyrocket", "date_published": "2019-03-09 00:00:00", "article_length": 4468, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:32.684188"}

What I fought for in 1986 is more important than ever \u2014 climate change is an existential threat. Now. Today.\u201d\u201cWe need policies that reflect this urgency. I'll have more specifics on how America can lead on climate in the coming weeks.\u201dBut progressive activist and environmental groups pounced amid the report about his plan. Sunrise Movement issued a scorching statement, calling Biden\u2019s plan \u201ca death sentence for our generation.\u201dProminent anti-capitalism activist Naomi Klein, meanwhile, tweeted: \u201cNo Joe, there is no \"middle ground\" on climate breakdown - there is bold, transformative action or there is sinking ground, burning ground and churning ground.\u201dYet some Biden staffers have objected to Reuters\u2019 characterizations of the plan, issuing a number of tweets arguing that Biden\u2019s plan will be as radical as those of his more progressive opponents.Biden \u201cknows how high the stakes are,\u201d campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo said on Twitter. \u201cAs president, Biden would enact a bold policy to tackle climate change in a meaningful and lasting way, and will be discussing the specifics of that plan in the near future.\u201d\u201cAny assertions otherwise are not accurate,\u201d he added, noting in another tweet that \u201cReuters got it wrong.\u201d", "headline": "Ocasio-Cortez assails Biden's 'middle ground' climate change plan, says it's 'dealbreaker'", "article_name": "ocasio-cortez-assails-bidens-middle-ground-climate-change-plan-says-its-dealbreaker", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-assails-bidens-middle-ground-climate-change-plan-says-its-dealbreaker", "date_published": "2019-05-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 2727, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:33.425755"}

{"id": null, "body": "\n        The predicted temperature changes (darker red indicating greater change) due to global warming, based on data that scientists, policymakers and the public are now questioning. Can you rely on the weather forecast? Maybe not, at least when it comes to global warming predictions over short time periods.That\u2019s the upshot of  that compared 117 climate predictions made in the 1990's to the actual amount of warming. Out of 117 predictions, the study\u2019s author told FoxNews.com, three were roughly accurate and 114 overestimated the amount of warming. On average, the predictions forecasted two times more global warming than actually occurred.Some scientists say the study shows that climate modelers need to go back to the drawing board.\"It's a real problem ... it shows that there really is something that needs to be fixed in the climate models,\" climate scientist John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, told FoxNews.com.'I looked at 73 climate models going back to 1979 and every single one predicted more warming than happened in the real world.'But other scientists say that's making a mountain out of a molehill.\"This is neither surprising nor particularly troubling to me as a climate scientist,\" Melanie Fitzpatrick, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told FoxNews.com. \"The work of our community is constantly to refine our understanding of the climate system and improve models based on that,\" she added.The climate models, Fitzpatrick said, will likely be correct over long periods of time. But there are too many variations in climate to expect models to be accurate over two decades.But John Christy says that climate models have had this problem going back 35 years, to 1979, the first year for which reliable satellite temperature data exists to compare the predictions to.\"I looked at 73 climate models going back to 1979 and every single one predicted more warming than happened in the real world,\" Christy said.Many of the overestimations also made their way into the popular press. In 1989, the Associate Press reported: \"Using computer models, researchers concluded that global warming would raise average annual temperatures nationwide 2 degrees by 2010.\"But , global temperature has increased by less than half that -- about 0.7 degrees Fahrenheit -- from 1989 to 2010.And in 1972, the reported: \"Arctic specialist Bernt Balchen says a general warming trend over the North Pole is melting the polar ice cap and may produce an ice-free Arctic Ocean by the year 2000.\" That also proved wrong.But people should still be concerned about global warming, Fitzpatrick says.\"The paper in no way diminishes the extensive body of observations that global warming is happening and that it is largely due to human activity,\" she added.\"Global surface temperature is still rising ... 2012 was in the top ten warmest years on record. The period 2001-2010 was the warmest on record since instrumental measurements began,\" she added.Christy agrees that there has been some warming over time, but says man-made greenhouse gasses are not as big of a driver of climate change as many think -- and that many scientists are in denial about their mistakes.\"I think in one sense the climate establishment is embarrassed by this, and so they're trying to minimize the problem,\" he said. \"The fundamental thing a climate model is supposed to predict is temperature. And yet it gets that wrong.\"The study authors did not answer questions from FoxNews.com about the policy implications of their research.Why were the predictions off? The study authors list many possible reasons, from solar irradiation and incorrect assumptions about the number of volcanic eruptions to bad estimates about how CO2 effects cloud patterns.Christy said he believes the models overestimate warming because of the way they handle clouds.\u201cMost models assume that clouds shrink when there is CO2 warming, and that lets in more sun, and that's what heats up the planet \u2013 not so much the direct effect of CO2, but the \u2018feedback effect\u2019 of having fewer clouds. In the real world, though, the clouds aren't shrinking,\u201d he said.The study also says that an overestimate of the power of CO2 as a greenhouse gas could be why the models over-predict, but that they do not know why the models are wrong at this point.Christy said he is not optimistic about the models being fixed.\"The Earth system is just too complex to be represented in current climate models.

{"id": null, "body": "If you think the economic shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic was bad, be forewarned: the economic impact of former Vice President  new climate change plan would make the last few months look like prosperity. Biden\u2019s original climate change  was to spend $1.7 trillion over a decade and phase out fossil fuels by 2050. But that plan was unveiled during the primary season, and since then the presumptive Democratic  has moved further left.Apparently, Biden\u2019s earlier plan wasn\u2019t extreme enough to please the far-left activists who surround him, so he went back to the drawing board and came up with something even more drastic.Released Tuesday, Biden\u2019s  comes with a whopping  in the first four years and moves the deadline for switching to 100 percent carbon-free power up by 15 years to 2035.That switch would entail massive investments in new facilities and painful dislocations and job losses for millions of workers currently employed in every stage of the energy production process, from extracting resources to delivering electricity to consumers.These are just some of the complications with vastly overhauling an industry that Americans depend upon so heavily and that accounts for over  in annual economic activity.A recent  by Wood Mackenzie, a global consultancy group, found that the transition to a 100 percent renewable U.S. power grid would require an \u201cinvestment of up to US$4.5 trillion over the next 10 to 20 years.\u201dGiven the cost overruns with most government projects, does anyone really believe even $4.5 trillion would be sufficient? Where is that money coming from? At least in theory, from us \u2014 through the tax increases Biden would impose upon American workers and businesses if he is elected president.The problem is, there will be far fewer workers and businesses left to pay Biden\u2019s higher tax rates once his job- and business-killing climate agenda begins to take effect.Republicans have attacked Biden for wanting to achieve this goal by totally banning fracking \u2014 the oil and natural gas extraction process that created the current American energy boom. Such a ban would kill jobs and damage the economies of key election states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. Biden has denied this, stating that he would not ban all fracking, but only wants to end \u201cnew permits for federal lands and waters.\u201dBut how can you achieve 100 percent carbon-free energy without eliminating oil and natural gas as an energy source \u2014 and, therefore, eliminating fracking? The reality is that you can\u2019t.Maybe Biden\u2019s position is actually that he won\u2019t ban fracking immediately, but will just eliminate it over time. But is that what voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania are hoping to hear?Should Biden be elected president, I suspect his \u201cno fracking ban\u201d pledge would soon fall into the dust bin of other infamous campaign claims \u2014 such as George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988  of \u201cno new taxes\u201d and Barack Obama\u2019s 2008  that he was \u201cnot in favor of gay marriage.\"So, why the subterfuge? Well, this de facto fracking ban allows Biden to tell voters he will not ban fracking (with fact-checker ) while simultaneously letting his far-left supporters know that he plans to eliminate it.For Biden, this is a win-win that is certain to thrill radical climate activists \u2014 particularly the Biden campaign\u2019s climate policy adviser, Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But it also completely ignores the role fracking plays in the broader economy and in reducing \u2014 yes, reducing \u2014 carbon dioxide emissions.For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration,\u00a0 that carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. declined 14 percent\u00a0between 2005 and 2017, \u201cmainly because more electricity has been generated from natural gas\u201d\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a more efficient and \u201cless carbon-intensive fuel than either coal or petroleum.\u201dThe Energy Information Administration also  that \u201cnatural gas was the largest source \u2014about 38% \u2014 of U.S. electricity generation in 2019.\u201d That inexpensive and plentiful low-carbon natural gas comes from fracking.Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s climate activist allies continue to throw up obstacles to the construction of desperately needed pipelines to deliver oil and natural gas. Pipelines are significantly safer, cleaner and more efficient than transporting oil and natural gas by truck or train.But climate activists view the battle over carbon dioxide emissions in quasi-religious terms. This allows them to justify actions that are rationally inconsistent with their objectives and bound to hurt low-income Americans the most, in the form of higher electricity and home-heating costs.Biden\u2019s eagerness to accommodate the demands of the far-left makes it all but inevitable that he would shelve all new and ongoing pipeline projects permanently if he ever makes it to the Oval Office.Should even Biden\u2019s current concessions prove insufficient for his climate team (as concessions to the far left so often are), expect to see the hapless nominee unveil even more extreme \u201camendments\u201d to his new climate plan before the November election.Don\u2019t be surprised by the changes. The zeal of those around Biden to destroy the American economy knows no bounds.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comThe United States submitted a formal notification that it will\u00a0withdraw from the \u00a0agreement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday, a move that has been widely expected since President  announced his intention to do so in 2017.The\u00a0c\u00a0agreement, which went into force Nov. 4, 2016, committed\u00a0countries that signed the measure to take certain voluntary\u00a0steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement was not legally enforceable and countries set their own . The accord banned countries from announcing their intent to withdraw in its first three years, meaning Monday was the first day the U.S. was allowed to submit its intent to leave the agreement since it went into force in 2016.\"President Trump made the decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement because of the unfair economic burden imposed on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers by U.S. pledges made under the Agreement,\" Pompeo said in a statement. \"The United States has reduced all types of emissions, even as we grow our economy and ensure our citizens\u2019 access to affordable energy.\"Trump has previously said that the Paris climate agreement harms the U.S. economy and would hurt American jobs if left to stand.\"Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates,\" Trump said in the \u00a0in 2017 when he announced plans to remove the U.S. from the accord.\u00a0\"This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs \u2014 not what we need \u2014 believe me, this is not what we need \u2014 including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. \u00a0They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.\"Some opponents of the agreement\u00a0have noted that countries such as Russia and China were not affected as significantly by the accord as\u00a0the United States and pointed\u00a0out the unencouraging results of the Kyoto Protocol,\u00a0raising questions about whether the Paris agreement would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at all.\"Half of the countries that were legally bound to the Kyoto Protocol treaty failed to adhere to their pledges, and the host country of Japan even increased their carbon emissions,\" Sen. , R-Okla., said as the Paris climate agreement was being debated in 2016. \"Now we find ourselves celebrating an agreement where the world\u2019s largest carbon emitter, China, is permitted to increase their emissions until 2025 and to continue bringing a coal-fired power plant online every 10 days. We even turn a blind eye to the fact that China lied about its carbon emissions when it first came to the table with its pledge last year.\"Others, however, see America backing out of the international pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions as an abdication of global leadership and denial of basic climate science.\"By withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement to double-down on a coal & fossil fuel energy agenda, Trump has engaged in a unilateral disarmament in the economic arms race that is the transition to clean energy,\" said Michael Mann, a climate scientist and professor at Penn State University. \"The challenge of averting dangerous and irreversible climate change and massive coastal inundation, devastating floods and droughts, is that much more an uphill climb with Trump's pullout from the Paris agreement.\"In his statement Monday, however, Pompeo maintained that the United States was on the right track both economically and environmentally.\"Our results speak for themselves,\" he wrote.\u00a0\"U.S. emissions of criteria air pollutants that impact human health and the environment declined by 74 percent\u00a0between 1970 and 2018.\u00a0U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions dropped 13 percent\u00a0from 2005-2017, even as our economy grew over 19 percent.\"", "headline": "United States begins process of withdrawing from Paris climate deal", "article_name": "united-states-begins-process-of-withdrawing-from-paris-climate-agreement", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/united-states-begins-process-of-withdrawing-from-paris-climate-agreement", "date_published": "2019-11-04 00:00:00", "article_length": 3958, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:42.795635"}
{"id": null, "body": "Heat waves are setting all-time temperature records across the globe, again. Europe suffered its deadliest fire in more than a century, and one of nearly 90 large fires in the U.S. West burned dozens of homes and forced the evacuation of at least 37,000 people near Redding, California. Flood-inducing downpours have pounded the U.S. East this week.It's all part of summer \u2014 but it's all being made worse by human-caused climate change, scientists say.\"Weirdness abounds,\" said Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis.Japan hit 106 degrees on Monday, its hottest temperature ever. Records fell in parts of Massachusetts, Maine, Wyoming, Colorado, Oregon, New Mexico and Texas. And then there's crazy heat in Europe, where normally chill Norway, Sweden and Finland all saw temperatures they have never seen before on any date, pushing past 90 degrees. So far this month, at least 118 of these all-time heat records have been set or tied across the globe, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The explanations should sound as familiar as the crash of broken records.\"We now have very strong evidence that global warming has already put a thumb on the scales, upping the odds of extremes like severe heat and heavy rainfall,\" Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh said. \"We find that global warming has increased the odds of record-setting hot events over more than 80 percent of the planet, and has increased the odds of record-setting wet events at around half of the planet.\"Climate change is making the world warmer because of the build-up of heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil and other human activities. And experts say the jet stream \u2014 which dictates weather in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 is again behaving strangely.\"An unusually sharply kinked jet stream has been stuck in place for weeks now,\" said Jeff Masters, director of the private Weather Underground. He says that allows the heat to stay in place over three areas where the kinks are: Europe, Japan and the western United States.The same jet stream pattern caused the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Russian heat wave and fires, the 2011 Texas and Oklahoma drought and the 2016 Canadian wildfires, Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said, pointing to past studies by him and others. He said in an email that these extremes are \"becoming more common because of human-caused climate change and in particular, the amplified warming in the Arctic.\"Climate scientists have long said they can't directly link single weather events, like a heat wave, to human caused climate change without extensive study. In the past decade they have used observations, statistics and computer simulations to calculate if global warming increases the chances of the events.A study by European scientists Friday found that the ongoing European heat wave is twice as likely because of human-caused global warming, though those conclusions have not yet been confirmed by outside scientists. The World Weather Attribution team said they compared three-day heat measurements and forecasts for the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland with historical records going back to the early 1900s.\"The world is becoming warmer and so heat waves like this are becoming more common,\" said Friederike Otto, a member of the team and deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.Erich Fischer, an expert on weather extremes at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich who wasn't part of the analysis said the authors used well-established methods to make their conclusions.Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said the link between climate change and fires isn't as strong as it is with heat waves, but it is becoming clearer.A devastating fire in Greece \u2014 with at least 83 fatalities \u2014 is the deadliest fire in Europe since 1900, according to the International Disaster Database run by the Centre for the Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels, Belgium.In the United States on Friday, there were 89 active large fires, consuming nearly 900,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. So far this year, fires have burned 4.15 million acres, which is nearly 14 percent higher than average over the past 10 years.The first major science study to connect greenhouse gases to stronger and longer heat waves was in 2004. It was titled \"More intense, more frequent and longer lasting heat waves in the 21st century.\" Study author Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said Friday that now it \"reads like a prediction of what has been happening and will continue to happen as long as average temperatures continue to rise with ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. It's no mystery.\"___Borenstein reported from Washington, Jordans from Berlin.___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .

{"id": null, "body": "The latest National Climate Assessment concludes that without 'substantial and sustained global mitigation,' climate change will cause 'growing losses to American infrastructure and property' and impede the 'rate of economic growth'; Ellison Barber reports.Former Vice President Al Gore accused the Trump administration of trying to \u201cbury\u2019 a damning government report that linked global warming to the worsening of natural disasters by quietly releasing the study on the Friday after Thanksgiving.Gore, who since his time as vice president has become an outspoken advocate for the need to counteract the effects of global warming, said in a statement that the White House was trying to \u201cbury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis\u201d by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving. The day, known as Black Friday,\u00a0has become the traditional start of the holiday shopping season and one that most Americans have off from work.\u201cUnbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the West, hurricanes batter our coasts \u2014 and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis,\u201d Gore said in a statement that he posted on Twitter Friday.\u00a0\u201cThe president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible.\u201dThe National Climate Assessment, which is mandated by law every few years and is based on more than 1,000 previous research studies, details how global warming -- from the burning of coal, oil and gas -- is hurting each region of the United States and how it impacts different sectors of the economy, including energy and agriculture. It was written long before the deadly fires in California this month and before Hurricanes Florence and Michael raked the East Coast and Florida.\"Climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life, the economy, and the natural systems that support us,\" the report says.This includes worsening air pollution causing heart and lung problems, more diseases from insects, the potential for a jump in deaths during\u00a0heat waves, and nastier allergies, according to the report.\u201cAnnual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century \u2014 more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states,\" the report says. It'll be especially costly on the nation's coasts because of rising seas and severe storm surges, which will lower property values. And in some areas, such as parts of Alaska and Louisiana, coastal flooding will likely force people to relocate.\u201dWhile Gore has become one of the most prominent advocates for reducing carbon emissions and fighting to reduce the effect of climate change, the former vice president has not been immune from claims that his work is not as altruistic as it appears.Gore left the vice president\u2019s residence with a relatively modest net worth of $1.7 million -- mostly from family farm assets -- but since the release of his 2006 documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d and his continuing global tour to preach his message, he has amassed a fortune valued at upward of $200 million. From the fossil fuels he burns jetting around the globe, to his socializing with Hollywood heavy hitters, to his 6,500-square-foot seafront home in California that cost $8.8 million, some climate activists have questioned whether Gore is helping or hurting the climate fight.\u201cHe is a flawed character,\u201d Stephen Lacey, editor-in-chief of the magazine GreenTechMedia, said on his podcast \u201cThe Energy Gang\u201d last year. \u201cWe\u2019re in an era of backlash against elites, so Gore, a guy who bought a 6,500-square-foot seafront home in California for $8.8 million, and who hangs around with other celebrities who talk big on climate but who live lavish lifestyles, is the perfect target at this point in time.\u201dGore\u2019s lifestyle aside, his statement comes amid what appears to be a continuing denial from Trump and members of his administration about the dangers climate change\u00a0poses to the environment and to the world\u2019s economy.Earlier in the week, Trump tweeted about the brutal cold spell that hit the East Coast over the Thanksgiving holiday and questioned \u201cWhatever happened to Global Warming?\u201dFriday's report seemed to anticipate such comments, saying: \"Over shorter timescales and smaller geographic regions, the influence of natural variability can be larger than the influence of human activity ... Over climate timescales of multiple decades, however, global temperature continues to steadily increase.\"The Lower 48 states have warmed 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) since 1900 with 1.2 degrees in the last few decades, according to the report. By the end of the century, the U.S. will be 3 to 12 degrees (1.6 to 6.6 degrees Celsius) hotter depending on how much greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, the report warns.Releasing the report on Black Friday \"is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying, but suppressing\u00a0the best of climate science,\" said study co-author Andrew Light, an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute.During a press conference Friday, officials behind the report repeatedly declined to answer questions about the timing of its release and why it contradicts public statements from Trump.

{"id": null, "body": "  There is a tradition in politics that is similar to one in the legal profession: When evidence supports your position, make your argument based on the evidence, but when it argues against your position, ignore the evidence and appeal to emotion.The evidence is piling up that \"climate change,\" formerly known as \"global warming,\" is losing evidentiary support, despite recent \"preliminary findings\" by a group of \"experts\" from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that a Washington Post editorial suggests may prove, \"warming has boosted the chances, in some cases significantly, that certain unwelcome weather or weather-related disasters will occur.\" The Post and other \"true believers\" ignore or ridicule a growing body of evidence rebutting their beliefs.Most bad weather -- from hurricanes, which have been few this season, to tornadoes -- are unwelcome by those in their paths, but these weather phenomena have existed for centuries.Both sides seem to agree that CO2 levels are elevated, but they don't agree on whether that will cause dangerous climate change, including rising temperatures and turbulent weather.The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) argues, \"The human effect is likely to be small relative to natural variability, and whatever small warming is likely to occur will produce benefits as well as costs.\"[pullquote]Yet the climate change cultists continue to focus on melting polar ice caps and \"displaced\" polar bears as part of their emotional appeal for government to \"fix\" the problem. Now comes a report in the UK Daily Mail that \"eminent scientists\" have observed a record return of the Arctic ice cap as it grows by 60 percent in a year, covering with ice almost 1 million more square miles of ocean than in 2012.In 2007, the BBC reported that by 2013, global warming would leave the Arctic \"ice free.\"Oops!Just how silly this is getting is an assertion by some activists that the current tensions in Syria might be linked to climate change. That's not as harebrained as a newspaper report in January 1933, which said, \"Yo-Yo Banned in Syria, Blamed for Drought by Moslems.\"The Syrians of 1933 actually believed the up and down of a toy yo-yo affected the weather. If it went down and sprang right back up, rain. If it went down and didn't spring up, drought. Police reportedly patrolled the streets, confiscating the toy. Ridiculous? Not as ridiculous as some of the junk science coming out of climate research circles today.Last March, the Daily Mail reported that global temperatures are about to drop \"below the level that the (computer) models forecast with '90 percent certainty.'\"Marc Morano, a former staff member of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (whose web page climatedepot.com offers numerous scientific articles debunking climate change), emails me: \"As a long observer of the global weather movement, I can say that the events of 2013 (have) been one of the most devastating to the movement. Both poles have record expanding ice. Global temperatures have failed to rise for 15 plus years, sea level rise is failing to accelerate, tornadoes are at record lows, hurricanes are near record low activity ... 2013 may be the year in which man-made global warming fears enter the dustbin of history.\"I doubt it. Too many people have too much invested in perpetuating this fiction. Billions of dollars and other currencies have been diverted into \"green\" projects in a Chicken Little attempt to stop the sky from falling. The BBC reports it as fact in virtually every story it does on the environment. Ditto the American media. Most media ignore evidence that counters climate change proponents.Former Vice President Al Gore has made a personal fortune promoting the cult of global warming, a cult being partially defined as a belief system that ignores proof contrary to its beliefs.

Credit: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory It's no secret that human activity is\u00a0, and one new study shows how our influence is seriously affecting Earth's seasons and atmosphere.Climate change is much more than\u00a0. In a new study, scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and five otherorganizations show that human action significantly affects the seasonal temperature cycle in the troposphere, or\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 the layer that we live in where weather occurs.These researchers used what is known as a \"fingerprint\" technique, in which they separated human influence from natural influence on climate. This allowed them to isolate human contributions and assess the specific effects of our species. And, while many fingerprint studies explore climate patterns over years and decades, this work shows how humans influence the changing seasons. []In this new study, scientists examined seasonal temperature cycles in the troposphere and observed the profound impact humans are having on the atmosphere and our seasons. Most notably, the researchers found that because of carbon dioxide emissions, Earth's seasonal \"heartbeat,\" or the contrast between hot summers and cold winters, is becoming stronger.The team used temperature measurements taken by satellites to study changes in the size of the seasonal temperature cycle in the troposphere at different points on the planet's surface. In this way, the researchers could see the difference between summer and winter temperatures and the difference between warm and cold seasons.The investigators found that our summers are warming more rapidly than the other seasons as Earth's overall temperature rises, a phenomenon that is especially true in the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, the measured temperatures in the troposphere are consistent with models that suggest a strengthening seasonal heartbeat.\"Our results suggest that attribution studies with the changing seasonal cycle provide powerful and novel evidence for a significant human effect on Earth's climate,\" Benjamin Santer, LLNL climate scientist and lead author on the new work,\u00a0.Climate fingerprint research, which originated in the 1970's, studies climate patterns to find the source of large climate changes. It takes into account natural factors that contribute to climate like ocean heat, the water cycle, circulation in the atmosphere, sea ice, and extreme natural events, according to the statement. In this study, researchers studied model climate simulations driven by historical changes in human behavior. The team found a highly significant \"pattern match\" between seasonal temperature trends and the human influence, or \"fingerprint,\" on the troposphere, according to the statement. This shows that observed changes in our atmosphere and seasonal tropospheric temperature cycles are most likely caused by human action, the study said.This is the first formal fingerprint study that has ever been conducted with the changing seasonal tropospheric temperature cycle, according to the statement.This work was\u00a0\u00a0in the journal Science.", "headline": "Climate change strengthens Earth's 'heartbeat' - and that's bad news", "article_name": "climate-change-strengthens-earths-heartbeat-and-thats-bad-news", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-strengthens-earths-heartbeat-and-thats-bad-news", "date_published": "2018-07-25 00:00:00", "article_length": 3181, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:47.900824"}

It's not going to be fought with bullets or aircraft carriers, although the Chinese are building up their military in an aggressive and threatening way.\u00a0This will more likely be an all-out for global supremacy. The yuan versus the dollar. The Nasdaq versus the Shanghai Stock Exchange.Meanwhile, America is asleep at the switch -- at least, theis. This is the worst possible time to be raising tax rates on American companies (Our business tax rates would be higher than China's under President Joe Biden's plan!), dismantling American energy (at a time when China is running 1,000 dirty coal plants with dozens more in construction), and running up the national debt (with China a major purchaser of the bonds).\u00a0Love  or hate him, he was a president who put America first and recognized the predatory nature of the Chinese regime. He got tough with President Xi Jinping and overturned one-sided trade deals. His strategy was to do what former President Ronald Reagan did to win the Cold War: Make America tremendously prosperous by building up our strategic industries in a way that the Soviet Union or China couldn't compete with.\u00a0The danger is that we now have a president in Biden who thinks that climate change is a bigger threat to the world than the Maoists in Beijing.\u00a0And make no mistake about it; the communists are back in charge in China. Jinping has basically announced himself to be president for life, as democracy and free elections fly out the window. China is also sprinting back to command and control fascist government and industry \"cooperation.\" That's a model that will eventually implode, but as we learned from the Soviet menace, they can do a lot of damage to peace and prosperity in the meantime.It's no accident that China's economy and stock market are faltering. In the last year, as the U.S. stock market has risen by about 20% (thanks to Operation Warp Speed), China's Shanghai stock market went down 15%. They are sprinting toward socialism faster than we are... for now.\u00a0The Chinese stock market jitters reflect global investors' irritation with the more frequent political interventions in business affairs. As Foreign Affairs magazine recently put it regarding these iron-fisted interferences into the business activities of its largest companies: \"Xi has placed China on a risky trajectory, one that threatens the (free market) achievements of his predecessors.\"\u00a0In short, events of recent months both militarily and economically confirm that the modern Maoists are firmly entrenched in Beijing, and capitalism is losing. Jinping's administration simply doesn't get what George H.W. Bush once so eloquently described as \"that freedom thing.\"\u00a0Militant social controls and restraints on individual liberty are now being matched with economic controls on Chinese megacorporations that are trying to vie for industry supremacy in technology, biology, manufacturing and transportation. Is all of this reminiscent of Japan circa 1939?\u00a0What is the Biden administration's response to these threats? The massive $5 trillion spend, tax and borrow bill he is steamrolling through Congress will impair American economic supremacy almost overnight.\u00a0Under Trump, tax rate reductions led to a $1 trillion infusion of capital from around the world, coming back to these shores to build up our industrial might. Biden's tax policies will have the reverse effect: deindustrialization.\u00a0We are, as a nation, now back to importing tens of billions of dollars of energy from OPEC and Russia instead of selling the hundreds of years' worth of oil, gas and coal.\u00a0Do the progressives who now run Washington really believe we are going to defeat the rising Communist China threat by building windmills? Do they think that redistributing income and wealth makes more sense than creating it?Will we be in any economic shape to repel China's militaristic advances in the South China Sea, in India, in Africa and perhaps on to the shores of Taiwan with the policies in place in Washington today?\u00a0Doubtful.\u00a0The war with China is on.

Perhaps we should slow down and think about the consequences of allowing our adversaries to supply the world with cheap energy, because one thing is for sure \u2013 wind farms and solar panels won't get the job done.The objective reader should examine all sides of the climate debate and should ask himself: Are the consequences of acting hastily worse than not acting at all?

These people are wrong more times than Kilmeade\u2019s barber.\u00a0As Bjorn Lomborg points out in the New York Post \u2013 the report has some sensible stuff \u2013 reconfirming that, unlike the last five inches of Kat\u2019s hair, global warming is real. But there's something mind-blowing no one wants to talk about.Climate change is saving hundreds of thousands of lives. I repeat: climate change is saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Shush, did you hear that? I think it\u2019s John Kerry\u2019s face melting.\u00a0Fact: more people died from cold weather than hot. A new Lancet study reports that while a half million people die from heat per year, roughly 4.5 million die from the cold. More than have officially died worldwide from COVID, but global warming has reduced the intensity of extreme cold weather.According to Lomborg: \"as temperatures have increased over the past two decades, that has caused an extra 116,000 heat deaths each year... But... Because global warming has also reduced cold waves, we now see 283,000 fewer cold deaths.\"I would say do the math, but I don't want to make Kat cry on national TV. I will make it simple: 283,000 minus 116,000 equals 167,000 lives saved each year.You hear that Greta. Climate change is saving lives. Not costing them. No wonder she\u2019s mad.If you think about it, Jesse Watters has saved thousands of lives just by the amount of hairspray he uses every day. Maybe that's how he saved the world!There's some other surprising news you won't hear from Bill Nye the science lie. For example, more CO2 in the atmosphere leads to a greening of the planet. One  study, Lomborg points out, found that climate change added an \"area of green equivalent that's twice the size of the US. Or one Tyrus.To put it another way... Every time Joy Behar burps, the rain forest grows by 18%. You won't hear that on CNN. They're too busy blaming you for killing the earth, or democracy itself. Let\u2019s see what they're covering now.Often times the media Apocalypto's will try to scare you by targeting your pocketbook. Meaning, what will this cost you in prosperity. Well, due to climate change, the average earthling will only be 436% as well off in 2100 as they are now. Instead of 450%. That's it. Who cares!? The difference is enough to pay for one solar panel.\u00a0Which is a bummer because by 2100 we'll all be killed by homeless polar bears. Except for me. In 2050, I\u2019m planning to have my head placed in a vat of life-sustaining chemicals, where I\u2019ll continue to do this show forever.Wow, I am still sexier than ever. So \u2013 even as we hear this good news from the likes of Lomborg and others \u2013 you won't hear it anywhere else. Because the activist class needs to keep us in fear. As a way to control us.It's the same plan wives having been using on their husbands for years. Which, as the activists now see, works great. And they must be looking at covid, and thinking \u2013 why didn't we think of that!\u00a0Fear literally makes people ask the government to make them prisoners.

It is neither technologically nor politically feasible and doesn\u2019t solve for the fact that global emissions are rising because of China, India and other rapidly-developing nations. It would be potentially disastrous for our economy, and makes such extreme promises about employment and free higher education as to be comical.But we should also address the elephant in the room.  is real and industrial activity around the globe is contributing to it.Don\u2019t believe me? Listen to the top Republicans on our leading House and Senate energy and science panels: Reps. Greg Walden and Frank Lucas, and Sens. Lisa Murkowski and John Barrasso. Or listen to the head of the American Petroleum Institute, who confirmed recently that \u201cAmerica\u2019s natural gas and oil industry is meeting the climate challenge head-on.\u201dSo are the CEOs of Shell, Southern Company and other big energy companies, who not only are shepherding enormous corporate investments, but are literally putting their money where their mouths are and tying long-term compensation for senior executives to meeting their goals of reducing their carbon footprints.They understand that meeting the climate challenge will be good for business and jobs because of a rapidly changing global  market and demand for both cleaner and reliable electricity generation.Any real progress in addressing climate change, especially in divided government, will depend on a realistic agenda built on pushing better technologies around the world that can expand quickly and affordably, give us a balanced mix of low carbon sources, perform better, and are cheaper than the alternatives, so that the rapidly developing world chooses them instead of more emitting technologies.I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d rather those technologies be developed, commercialized and exported from the U.S. than elsewhere.The progressive wave overtaking the Democratic party has centered its future on outlandish big government solutions like the Green New Deal. These policies will increase the cost of our electricity bills, harm our economy, and hurt consumers across the country, all the while giving the edge to our global competitors.But climate change is not just our problem \u2013 it is a global problem. And China, India and other fast-growing developing countries aren\u2019t that interested in handcuffing themselves with policies that will limit their economic growth and access to power at a time of increasing demand. That\u2019s why new, emissions-reducing innovations for natural gas, coal and nuclear must be a part of the global mix.Clearly, we don\u2019t need to agree on the problem of climate change to agree that solutions to the problem ought to be partly based on global competitiveness and job creation benefits to U.S. clean energy innovation.Most people are surprised to know that the last Congress appropriated more money for energy research and development (R&D) than the Congress of the last term of the Obama presidency. These investments included technologies that can capture, store and use carbon emissions from fossil fuel generation.Spending on R&D is an essential element of progress. These are the investments that create the next breakthroughs. Energy R&D is a smart investment for the country and pays back exponentially. The shale gas revolution contributes an estimated $100 billion to consumers every year, and has been the main driver behind reducing power sector emissions in the past decade.In addition, lawmakers in both parties have supported big advancements toward the next generation of zero-emission nuclear power, which is good for our national security and our electric grid reliability. Nuclear is a trillion-dollar global export opportunity and we must not let it slip away.We need to be proactive. We need to be smart. The progressive wave overtaking the Democratic party has centered its future on outlandish big government solutions like the Green New Deal.

U.N. average forecasts  a further rise of between 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 80 years.Earlier this year, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pitched her Green New Deal by saying: \"Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z... we\u2019re like: \u2018The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don\u2019t address climate change.'\"Ocasio-Cortez has since said that she wasn't being literal \u2013\u00a0the world will still exist \u2013\u00a0but she continues to argue that there are 12 years left before catastrophic consequences become unavoidable.On Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez has set her top tweet to read: \"Climate change is here + we\u2019ve got a deadline: 12 years left to cut emissions in half.\"The claim is based on a U.N. report that says such a cut within 12 years is the only way to limit the temperature increase since pre-industrial times to 2.7 degrees\u00a0Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius). But the Earth has\u00a0\u00a01.8 degrees\u00a0Fahrenheit since those times \u2014\u00a0so the U.N.'s 12-year statistic is about the cuts needed to avoid a further increase of more than roughly 1 degree Fahrenheit.That's a far cry from \"the world is gonna end,\"\u00a0critics say.\"If we maintain our abundant energy and prosperity, then we'll still be doing great when it's that much warmer,\" Alex Epstein, author of the book \"The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,\"\u00a0told Fox News.Rep. Ocasio-Cortez , saying on Instagram: \"They are no longer being limited to the Great Plains, and are shifting to other regions of the country.\"While she noted that \"tornadoes are challenging to link to climate change links due to their nature,\" she went on to link them to climate change.\"The climate crisis is real y'all ... guess we're at casual tornadoes in growing regions of the country?\" she said.She left out that since the 1950s, strong tornadoes\u00a0have become slightly less common,\u00a0.\"Strong to violent tornado activity has been going down for decades, so when one happens now it seems unusual,\" Spencer said.An NPR article Ocasio-Cortez shared linked to an\u00a0\u00a0that found that tornadoes have increased in an area centered around states like Aransas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. But those increases have been offset by declines in other areas, in particular in Texas.The study reported that \"it is currently unknown if this is due to rising global temperatures or natural variability.\"The website \"The Conversation,\"\u00a0which advertises \"Academic rigor, journalistic flair\"  last week that an Indian tiger which allegedly ate a human \"tells us so much about the climate crisis.\"The article claimed: \"The reasons why big cats turn on humans are complex and can be specific to individuals. But they can no longer be explained outside the context of climate change.\"The article did not cite proof showing climate change caused man-eating tigers.It also failed to mention that Indian tiger populations increased sharply in recent years,\u00a0 1,411 tigers in 2008 to 2,226 in 2014, thanks to\u00a0.News outlets around the world recently covered a U.N. report on biodiversity.The New Yorker magazine ran the : \"Climate Change and the New Age of Extinction.\"Harvard Business Review \u00a0\"through a combination of human-caused climate change and the near complete occupation of the planet by humans, we\u2019re destroying habitats and species at an unreal rate (similar to previous extinction events from, you know, asteroids)...\"But critics say that such a \"mass extinction\" doesn't show up in the hard data \u2014\u00a0that the database cited by the U.N. actually shows a decline in species extinctions throughout the last century, as conservation efforts have increased.\"Extinctions peaked in the late 1800s and the early 20th century, followed by a significant decline that continues today,\" geologist\u00a0Gregory Wrightstone wrote on his website, \",\" on which he charted the raw extinction data.While those data show humans are getting better at conserving species, many animals still remain endangered \u2014\u00a0including certain species of elephants, rhinos, tigers, apes, giant turtles, and others.But the U.N. report itself finds that climate change plays a relatively small role in extinctions, putting it at less than one-fifth of the cause. Far greater is the impact of human encroachment on natural territory, according to the report.Given what\u00a0some scientists\u00a0see as climate alarmism, they advise the public to be skeptical.\"People can make up virtually any claim they want, connecting something in nature to human-caused climate change, and millions of people will believe it,\" Spencer said.He added: \"Our young people need to be taught how to think, not be told what to think.\"", "headline": "Five most over-the-top climate warnings", "article_name": "five-most-over-the-top-climate-warnings", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/five-most-over-the-top-climate-warnings", "date_published": "2019-05-28 00:00:00", "article_length": 5993, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:18:59.731955"}

But he argued that even as the earth was warming and continues to warm, mankind has been able to make immense advances, expanding food sources and access to electricity.\"Eventually we will probably need to do something about this, but the scope and scale of what the Biden administration proposed for the U.S., I think is just not there in the data,\" he said. Adding, \"It\u2019s not there in the science.\"\"I prefer to see us take a much more measured and thoughtful approach to doing this,\" Koonin said.Biden announced Thursday he plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030,\u00a0by relying on greener technologies and rethinking U.S. infrastructure.He plans to invest in union jobs and the middle class by expanding job opportunities while advancing \"environmental justice.\"But Koonin argues this is not necessarily feasible.\"The ambition to have a high percent of weather-dependent renewables on the electrical grid is something I would question,\" he said. \"The wind doesn\u2019t blow all the time, the sun doesn\u2019t shine all the time. And you\u2019ve got to have backup systems for when that happens.\"Koonin explained that ensuring backups to the renewable energy providers increases the cost of the energy grids as a whole \u2013 something he said will also make the change harder for developing countries to achieve.The NYU professor explained that the fight for clean energy is a \"secondary priority\" in countries throughout Africa and the Middle East.\"40 percent of the world\u2019s population, don\u2019t have adequate energy,\" he said, adding that projections show that as underdevelopment nations progress, energy use globally is going to go up by 50 percent come\u00a0the middle of the century.\"Eighty\u00a0percent of the world\u2019s energy come from fossil fuels,\" Koonin said, noting to the massive number of jobs created by the fossil fuel industry.\"That's the\u00a0nub of the problem -- because those developing countries account for half of the emissions now -- who\u2019s going to pay the developing countries not to emit?\" he questioned.Koonin said the U.S. needs to start exploring geoengineering options that could help cool the earth -- a topic he devotes a chapter to in his book.One option is to\u00a0make\u00a0the planet more reflective by releasing aerosols into the atmosphere.The second option he thinks the science community needs to better understand, is how to pull carbon dioxide out of the air.\u00a0\"I think we need to understand them better,\" Koonin said, adding it would be good to \"have the tool in your arsenal.\"See below for an excerpt from Koonin\u2019s latest book Despite headlines like \"Hurricanes are strengthening under human influences,\" and \"Climate change will be an economic disaster\" the science as summarized in UN and US government reports actually says that hurricanes show no detectable sign of human influence and that global warming several times the Paris Agreement \"guardrail\" will have minimal net impact on the US or global economies. Yet the politicians and media invariably invoke \"The Science\" as they proclaim a climate crisis.In fact, there has been far too little serious public discussion about the knowns and unknowns of climate science, since almost everyone gets their climate information at the end of a long game of telephone. It starts with the basic research findings, goes through the government reports and their summaries, and ends up in the media.

We have put an exhaustive amount of information out there to show people exactly what we do.\"The errors related to the calculation of the average global temperature trend since 1850, based on measurements from land-based thermometers. The record is regarded as one of the most robust pieces of empirical evidence for global warming during the past century.After trying to reproduce figures shown in scientific publications and on the Met Office Web site, Graham-Cumming identified a number of problems with the way measurements from Australian weather stations were averaged.He found that data from seven stations was discarded. Data from a further 112 Australian stations, 28 percent of the total, were not being fully included in calculations of year-on-year temperature differences.\"I'm not a climate skeptic, I think it's pretty sure that the world is warming up, but this does show why the raw data and not just the results should be available,\" he said.During the checking procedure, Met Office officials discovered further problems with U.S. temperature calculations. They realized that 121 of the U.S. stations did not have unique identifier codes, meaning that data for these stations was either being overwritten or assigned to the wrong location.When all of the errors identified were corrected, the temperature trend remained well within the 95 percent confidence range of the original plot, meaning that the difference would not be considered scientifically significant.For more on this story, ", "headline": "Key Climate Change Data Laden With Errors", "article_name": "key-climate-change-data-laden-with-errors", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/key-climate-change-data-laden-with-errors", "date_published": "2015-01-08 00:00:00", "article_length": 2811, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:19:05.854795"}

Biden\u2019s campaign said this would be supplemented by leveraging more than $5 trillion in additional private sector and state and local investments. This is considerably less expensive than the Green New Deal itself, for which cost estimates range as high as $93 trillion.But it follows criticism from\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others on the party's left flank about his stance on environmental issues.\u00a0The former vice president vowed he\u2019d\u00a0pay for the new plan by rolling back the tax incentives in President Trump\u2019s tax cuts that he argued \u201cenrich corporations at the expense of American jobs and the environment.\u201dBiden, in a statement announcing the plan, emphasized that \u201cmore severe storms and droughts, rising sea levels, warming temperatures, shrinking snow cover and ice sheets -- it's already happening. We must take drastic action now to address the climate disaster facing the nation and our world.\u201dAnd he warned that \u201cscience tells us that how we act or fail to act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet.\u201dThe unveiling of the 22-page plan comes three weeks after Biden teased he would soon be producing a proposal, as he pushed back against criticism by rising progressive political star and freshman Rep. Ocasio-Cortez of New York that his record on tackling climate change was \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201dBiden\u2019s campaign, in spelling out the plan, said that the Green New Deal \u201ccaptures two basic truths\u201d \u2013 that the nation \u201curgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge,\u201d and that the environment and the country\u2019s economy \u201care completely and totally connected.\u201dThe Green New Deal, co-authored by Ocasio-Cortez, is a sweeping proposal introduced in Congress earlier this year that aims to transform the country\u2019s economy to combat climate change while enacting a host of new welfare programs.The Biden campaign said the former vice president\u2019s plan would ensure that the U.S. achieves a 100 percent clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emission no later than 2050. And they said that if elected president, on his first day in office Biden would sign a series of executive orders \u201cwith unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track.\u201dOther parts of the plan include demanding Congress pass a bill in Biden\u2019s first year in the White House that includes milestone targets no later than 2025, make an historic investment in clear energy, climate research and innovation, and \u201cincentivize the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy.\u201dThe campaign spotlighted that Biden would not only immediately recommit the U.S. to the Paris Agreements on climate change \u2013 reversing actions taken by Trump \u2013 but would also \u201crally the rest of the world to meet the threat of climate change.\u201dThe campaign also said that a Biden administration would take action against fossil fuel companies and others \u201cwho put profit over people and knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities\u2019 air, land, and water, or conceal information regarding potential environmental and health risks.\u201dAnd Biden, long a friend to organized labor, would vow \u201cnot to leave any workers or communities left behind\u201d as the nation transforms to a clean energy economy.Climate change is a top issue in the race for the Democratic nomination, with a number of Biden\u2019s rivals in the historically enormous field of 24 candidates releasing their own plans to tackle climate change.Last month, Biden past efforts in combating climate change were criticized by Ocasio-Cortez. She tweeted that Biden\u2019s upcoming climate plan \u201cis a dealbreaker. There is no 'middle ground' w/ climate denial & delay.\u201dA day later, at an event in support of the Green New Deal, she took aim again. Without mentioning the former vice president by name, Ocasio-Cortez highlighted that \u201cif the same politicians who refused to act then are going to try to come back today and say we need to have a \u2018middle of the road approach\u2019 to save our lives, that is too much for me.\u201dCampaigning soon after in New Hampshire, Biden responded.\u201cYou never heard me say \u2018middle of the road.\u2019 I\u2019ve never been middle-of-the-road on the environment.

Obama is in New York for three days of talks with foreign leaders at the annual United Nations General Assembly. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  While President Obama challenged China at the United Nations to follow the U.S. lead in pushing for drastic reductions in national carbon emissions to save the planet from \u201cclimate change,\u201d\u00a0it appears that China has dramatically different ideas. As in: no.According to a document deposited at the Geneva-based U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in advance of a planned meeting next month, China -- now the world\u2019s largest source of greenhouse gases -- insists that the U.S. and other developed countries endure most of the economic pain of carbon emission cutbacks, and need to make significantly more sacrifices in the months ahead.Carbon emission cutbacks by China and other developing countries, the document says, will be \u201cdependent on the adequate finance and technology support provided by developed country parties\u201d to any new climate accord.In other words, only if Western nations pay for it.More specifically, only if Western taxpayers ante up.\u00a0 Among other things, the Chinese communist regime insists that the incentive payments it demands must come from \u201cnew, additional, adequate, predictable and sustained public funds\" -- rather than mostly private financing, as the U.S. hopes.In addition, the Chinese state:-- A promised $100 billion in annual climate financing that Western nations have already pledged\u00a0 to developing countries for carbon emission control and other actions by 2020\u00a0is only \u00a0the \"starting point\" for additional Western financial commitments that must be laid out in a \"clear road map,\" which includes \"specific targets, timelines and identified sources;\"--In the longer run, developed countries should be committing \u201cat least 1 percent\u201d of their Gross Domestic Product \u2014 much more than they spend on easing global poverty\u201d into a U.N.-administered Green Carbon Fund to pay for the developing country changes;--In the meantime, the $100 billion pledge to the same fund\u00a0should be reached by $10 billion increments, starting from a $40 billion floor this year;--Western countries also need to remove \u201cobstacles such as IPRs [intellectual property rights]\u201d to \u201cpromote, facilitate and finance the transfer\u201d of \u201ctechnologies and know-how\u201d to developing\u00a0countries in advance of any future climate deal;The Chinese submission is part of the paperwork submitted by a variety of nations in advance of negotiations on a new global climate treaty, which is slated to be unveiled at a grand climate summit meeting in Paris at the end of 2015.\u00a0This week\u2019s ballyhooed climate summit in New York City was intended to kick-start the diplomatic process that will wend toward the Paris finale.The Paris 2015 treaty is supposed to replace the tattered Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2020, and which the U.S. never ratified \u2014 in large measure because huge greenhouse emitters like China and India were given a pass from most of its strictures.Since then, countries like Canada and Russia have left the protocol, and others, like Japan, have declined to tighten the screws further on carbon emissions in a time of faltering economic growth.But while President Obama was telling the summit attendees in New York that \u201cnobody can stand on the sidelines on this issue,\u201d and advising world leaders that he had told China\u2019s top delegate at their meeting that \u201cwe have a special responsibility to lead,\u201d\u00a0China has staked\u00a0out its much tougher position\u00a0 in a nine-page position paper drearily titled, \u201cSubmission on the Work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Durban Platform for Enhanced Action.\u201dThe working group, part of the UNFCCC process, is pulling together international positions to develop a consensus starting point for the Paris treaty negotiations, which will supposedly be unveiled at a meeting in Lima, Peru, in December. The Chinese paper, however, went to an earlier preparatory meeting slated to begin in Bonn on October 25.According to the Chinese, all of the additional Western action is necessary because developing countries have already done their part at greenhouse gas cutbacks\u2014or, as the position paper has it, in typical U.N. climate-speak, \u201chave already communicated and implemented ambitious nationally appropriate mitigation actions.\u201dIndeed, the paper continues, \u201cTheir contribution to global mitigation efforts is far greater than that by developed countries.\u201dThat conclusion appears to largely draw on the fact that China believes that Western\u00a0countries are \u201cresponsible for the current and future concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere because of their historical, current and future emissions,\u201d while \u201cdeveloping countries have the right to equitable development opportunities and sustainable development.\u201dThat was largely the logic behind the faltering Kyoto Protocol, in which China pledged only to reduce the \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d\u2014the relative greenhouse gas efficiency-- of its industrialization, without any effort at actual cutbacks.Optimists now believe that China will move in the new round of climate negotiations toward an actual trajectory of cutbacks, but there is no sign of that ambition in the current position paper.In fact, the paper argues that any new agreement should \u201cbe based and built\u201d on the structures of the old Kyoto deal, with \u201cdeveloped country Parties taking the lead in greenhouse gas emission reduction.\u201dThere is perhaps one major exception: \u201cCommitments by developed country Parties [to the new treaty] on providing finance, technology and capacity-building support to developing country Parties shall be of the same legal bindingness as their mitigation commitments.\u201dIn other words:\u00a0 pay-as-you-go on \u201cclimate change\u201d\u00a0 means that so far as China is concerned, the U.S. and other advanced countries should do all the paying, and most of the going.", "headline": "Climate change?

Todd said he was \"surprised\" by Biden's apparent whiff, while Glaude said he was \"stunned.\"\"If there's one thing that surprised me about the president's State of the Union, it was the lack of connecting the fight for democracy and freedom abroad with the fight for democracy and freedom at home.

U.N. climate talks are plodding ahead toward a worldwide deal to fight global warming. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File) The United Nations body that oversees greenhouse gas reductions is reeling from another cap-and-trade scandal that may have put 600 million tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere -- roughly speaking, the\u00a0annual CO2 output of Canada or Britain -- while the emissions were ostensibly suppressed, according to an independent study.In the process, the fraudsters, largely in Russia and Ukraine, were likely able to transfer credits for more than 400 million tons of their apparently bogus greenhouse savings by April 2015 into Europe\u2019s commercial carbon trading system -- the largest in the world --thereby undermining that continent\u2019s ambitious carbon reduction achievements.Perhaps significantly, the vast bulk of the assumed fraud took place in countries that are -- or were, in the case of Ukraine -- notorious for their kleptocratic leadership under the regimes of Vladimir Putin and\u00a0ousted\u00a0Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled his country in 2014. In Russia, much of the contract work for carbon project approval was carried out by state-owned Sberbank, which has been sanctioned by the U.S. and the European Union as part of the Western response to the Ukraine crisis.The bulk of the fraud occurred under the battered Kyoto Protocol for greenhouse gas emissions, but\u00a0researchers who detailed the scandal warned that\u00a0without tough international policing and\u00a0clear definitions of what every country involved in the climate deal aims to achieve, something similar could happen in the global climate change deal that world leaders are expected to endorse in Paris in December and that is intended to start up in 2020.It remains to be seen whether those safeguards will be in place. Among other things, the emerging deal is based on what the U.N. calls \u201cintended nationally determined contributions,\u201d\u00a0 or INDCs, that leave individual countries wide latitude for \u201cestimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, removals,\u201d as well as how the countries themselves consider their INDCs to be \u201cfair and ambitious.\u201dThe vast bulk of the assumed fraud took place in countries that are notorious for their kleptocratic leadership.The Obama administration has vocally proclaimed its support for the impending new climate agreement, and has announced its intention to impose dramatic cuts in U.S. carbon emissions of\u00a0 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, and make \u201cbest efforts\u201d to make the steeper cuts.The most recent scandal -- there have been others -- involves the United Nations Convention for Combating Climate Change\u00a0(UNFCCC), the body that oversees the Kyoto Protocol,\u00a0as detailed in a\u00a0128-page analysis\u00a0 issued by the Stockholm Environment Institute, a\u00a0widely-respected, Swedish-financed independent think tank whose authors staunchly support the need for a new climate deal.The authors claim that their study represents a \u201csubjective judgment\u201d of the evidence \u201cbased on the limited information publicly available,\u201d but also say that it is \u201cbased on a careful analysis applied in a consistent manner across projects.\u201dAmong other things, the document says that:One huge favorite: projects that claimed to extract coal from mining waste piles, said to prevent additional mining and save energy to boot. The researchers tallied the claims\u00a0in Ukraine and estimated they came to about one-third of the entire country\u2019s coal production, a highly implausible figure.Asked by Fox News about the report, a Bureau Veritas spokesperson said only that \u201cBureau Veritas' management has made the decision not to comment on this research.\u201dThe Stockholm researchers, who did not respond to questions from Fox News about their\u00a0effort, claim that their post-mortem could have \u201cimportant implications\u201d for any future cap-and-trade market mechanism under a new climate treaty -- starting with the fact that\u00a0countries should not be allowed to set fuzzy targets for their climate efforts that could give them carbon credit windfalls.(The authors do not say so, but one such fuzzy set of targets has been set by China, which says its aim is \u201cto achieve the peaking of carbon dioxide emissions around 2030 and make best efforts to peak early\u201d and to \u201clower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP\u201d -- as opposed to cutting emissions in absolute terms -- \u201cby 60 percent to 65 percent from the 2005 level.\u201d In 2013, China\u2019s CO2-GDP ratio was nearly double that of the U.S., according to a European government study.)Another reform that the Stockholm authors consider essential is that sole oversight of any such system by countries hosting carbon reduction projects \u201cis insufficient to ensure environmental integrity.\u201dBut even international oversight, the report warned, \u201cmay not eliminate the potential for excess issuance of [carbon] credits,\u201d and there is still the risk that countries could \u201champer the strengthening of a crediting mechanism\u2019s integrity.\u201dOn top of all that, the report warns, U.N. deliberations on how to register carbon suppression projects under a new climate agreement still \u201cresemble current Track 1 rules\u201d insofar as countries that host the projects can still conduct the registration.The UNFCCC can \u201crequest a review\u201d of the decision within 30 days, or it is automatically recorded. But draft changes to UNFCCC rule-making, the report observes, do not \u201cspecify any followup\u201d if the U.N. body \u201cdoes not conform to international rules.\u201dOverall, the authors warn, efforts to reform carbon credit schemes under the UNFCCC \u201chave shown that often no consensus can be reached to address and rectify environmental integrity shortcomings\u201d -- an unsurprising conclusion given the fact that, among other things, the Putin regime is still ascendant in Russia.All of which, the report concludes, may mean that\u00a0such \u201ccrediting mechanisms\u201d will have a \u201crather limited\u201d role when any\u00a0new climate deal goes into effect -- in other words, not an end to fraud on the value of carbon reduction projects, but hopefully less paying for it.Or, perhaps, just a new incentive to fraudsters to come up with other schemes. In December 2011, a report to the European Commission described another branch of the UNFCCC\u2019s carbon-reduction schemes, known as the Clean Development Mechanism,\u201d Soon thereafter, Europe dropped the worse of the schemes from its trading system, effective at the beginning of 2013 -- or about the time that the latest rush to cash in on Track 1 projects began.", "headline": "UN climate change body suffers mammoth European carbon fraud", "article_name": "un-climate-change-body-suffers-mammoth-european-carbon-fraud", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-climate-change-body-suffers-mammoth-european-carbon-fraud", "date_published": "2016-05-04 00:00:00", "article_length": 6648, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:19:13.666531"}

The scientific report on Thursday, Aug. 8, finds that as the world warms it degrades the land more. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno, File) GENEVA (AP) \u2014 Human-caused climate change is dramatically degrading the Earth's land and the way people use the land is making global warming worse, a new United Nations scientific\u00a0says. That creates a vicious cycle which is already making food more expensive, scarcer and less nutritious.\"The cycle is accelerating,\" said NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig, a co-author of the report. \"The threat of climate change affecting people's food on their dinner table is increasing.\"But if people change the way they eat, grow food and manage forests, it could help save the planet from a far warmer future, scientists said.Earth's land masses, which are only 30 percent\u00a0of the globe, are warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole. While heat-trapping gases are causing problems in the atmosphere, the land has been less talked about as part of climate change. A special report, written by more than 100 scientists and unanimously approved by diplomats from nations around the world Thursday at a meeting in Geneva, proposed possible fixes and made more dire warnings.\"The way we use land is both part of the problem and also part of the solution,\" said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a French climate scientist who co-chairs one of the panel's working groups. \"Sustainable land management can help secure a future that is comfortable.\"Scientists at Thursday's press conference emphasized both the seriousness of the problem and the need to make societal changes soon.\"We don't want a message of despair,\" said science panel official Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London. \"We want to get across the message that every action makes a difference.\"Still the stark message hit home hard for some of the authors.\"I've lost a lot of sleep about what the science is saying. As a person, it's pretty scary,\" Koko Warner, a manager in the U.N.

A report by the United Nations released on Thursday, Aug. 8, 2019, says that human-caused climate change is dramatically degrading the planet's land, while the way people use the Earth is making global warming worse. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)\n      The report said climate change already has worsened land degradation, caused deserts to grow, permafrost to thaw and made forests more vulnerable to drought, fire, pests and disease. That's happened even as much of the globe has gotten greener because of extra carbon dioxide in the air. Climate change has also added to the forces that have reduced the number of species on Earth.\"Climate change is really slamming the land,\" said World Resources Institute researcher Kelly Levin, who wasn't part of the study.And the future could be worse.\"The stability of food supply is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases,\" the report said.In the worst-case scenario, food security problems change from moderate to high risk with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now. They go from high to \"very high\" risk with just another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) of warming from now.\"The potential risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing,\" NASA's\u00a0\u00a0said. \"Just to give examples, the crop yields were effected in Europe just in the last two weeks.\"Scientists had long thought one of the few benefits of higher levels of carbon dioxide, the major heat-trapping gas, was that it made plants grow more and the world greener, Rosenzweig said. But numerous studies show that the high levels of carbon dioxide reduce protein and nutrients in many crops.For example, high levels of carbon in the air in experiments show wheat has 6 percent\u00a0to 13 percent\u00a0less protein, 4 percent\u00a0to 7 percent\u00a0less zinc and 5 percent\u00a0to 8 percent\u00a0less iron, she said.But better farming practices \u2014 such as no-till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer applications \u2014 have the potential to fight global warming too, reducing carbon pollution up to 18% of current emissions levels by 2050, the report said.If people change their diets, reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and seeds, the world can save as much as another 15% of current emissions by mid-century. It would also make people more healthy, Rosenzweig said.The science panel said they aren't telling people what to eat because that's a personal choice.Still, Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner, a panel leader from Germany who said he lost weight and felt better after reducing his meat consumption, told a reporter that if she ate less ribs and more vegetables \"that's a good decision and you will help the planet reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"Reducing food waste can fight climate change even more. The report said that between 2010 and 2016, global food waste accounted for 8 percent\u00a0to 10\u00a0percent\u00a0of heat-trapping emissions.\"Currently [25 percent to 30\u00a0percent]\u00a0of total food produced is lost or wasted,\" the report said. Fixing that would free up millions of square miles of land.With just another 0.9 degrees F of warming (0.5 degrees C), which could happen in the next 10 to 30 years, the risk of unstable food supplies, wildfire damage, thawing permafrost and water shortages in dry areas \"are projected to be high,\" the report said.At another 1.8 degrees F of warming (1 degree C) from now, which could happen in about 50 years, it said those risks \"are projected to be very high.\"Most scenarios predict the world's tropical regions will have \"unprecedented climatic conditions by the mid-to-late 21st century,\" the report noted.Agriculture and forestry together account for about 23\u00a0percent\u00a0of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the Earth, slightly less than from cars, trucks, boats and planes. Add in transporting food, energy costs, packaging and that grows to 37 percent, the report said.But the land is also a great carbon \"sink,\" which sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air.From about 2007 to 2016, agriculture and forestry every year put 5.7 billion tons (5.2 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air, but pulled 12.3 billion tons (11.2 billion metric tons) of it out.\"This additional gift from nature is limited.

{"id": null, "body": "Kerry mocks naysayers during speech in IndonesiaU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday called climate change perhaps the world's \"most fearsome\" destructive weapon and mocked those who deny its existence or question its causes, comparing them to people who insist the Earth is flat.In a speech to Indonesian students, civic leaders and government officials, Kerry tore into climate change skeptics. He accused them of using shoddy science and scientists to delay steps needed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at the risk of imperiling the planet.A day earlier, the U.S. and China announced an agreement to cooperate more closely on combating climate change. American officials hope that will help encourage others, including developing countries like Indonesia and India, to follow suit.China and the United States are the biggest sources of emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause the atmosphere to trap solar heat and alter the climate. Scientists say such changes are leading to drought, wildfires, rising sea levels, melting polar ice, plant and animal extinctions and other extreme conditions.Also in the Jakarta speech, Kerry said everyone and every country must take responsibility for the problem and act immediately.\"We simply don't have time to let a few loud interest groups hijack the climate conversation,\" he said, referring to what he called \"big companies\" that \"don't want to change and spend a lot of money\" to act to reduce the risks.Kerry later singled out major oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders.\"We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts,\" Kerry told the audience at a U.S. Embassy-run American Center in a shopping mall.\"Nor should we allow any room for those who think that the costs associated with doing the right thing outweigh the benefits.\"\"The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand,\" Kerry said. \"We don't have time for a meeting anywhere of the Flat Earth Society,\"Kerry said the cost of inaction will far outweigh the significant expense of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that trap solar heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the Earth's rising temperatures.He outlined a litany of recent weather disasters, particularly flooding and typhoons in Asia, and their impact on commerce, agriculture, fishing and daily living conditions for billions of people.\"This city, this country, this region, is really on the front lines of climate change,\" Kerry said. \"It's not an exaggeration to say that your entire way of life here is at risk.\"He added: \"In a sense, climate change can now be considered the world's largest weapon of mass destruction, perhaps even, the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.\"The solution, Kerry said, is a new global energy policy that shifts reliance from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies. He noted the President Barack Obama is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to their leaders to join.The U.S.-China statement issued just after Kerry left Beijing on Saturday said the two countries agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse gases, including reducing vehicle emissions, improving energy efficiency of buildings and other measures.Beijing and Washington launched a climate change discussion last year, promising progress in five areas: reducing vehicle emissions; advanced electric power grids; capturing and storing carbon emissions; gathering greenhouse gas data; and building efficiency.Kerry was in Indonesia on the last leg of a three-nation tour of Asia that started in South Korea. After leaving Indonesia on Monday, he planned to visit Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.Before the climate change speech, Kerry toured Jakarta's Istiqlal Mosque, one of the largest in the world, to pay his respects to Indonesia's Muslim majority population.", "headline": "Secretary of State Kerry lashes out at climate change skeptics", "article_name": "secretary-of-state-kerry-lashes-out-at-climate-change-skeptics", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/secretary-of-state-kerry-lashes-out-at-climate-change-skeptics", "date_published": "2015-12-20 00:00:00", "article_length": 3958, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:19:19.788120"}
{"id": null, "body": "\n        Researchers from Princeton University and the University of California-Berkeley suggest that more human conflict is a likely outcome of climate change. The researchers found that even one standard-deviation shift -- the amount of change from the local norm -- in temperature and precipitation greatly increase the risk of personal violence and social upheaval. Climate-change models predict an average of 2 to 4 standard-deviation shifts in global climate conditions by 2050 (shown here with darker colors), with 4 representing the greatest change in normal conditions. Feeling hot under the collar? It may not be all in your head.A new study connects rising world temperatures with aggressive acts of violence and even war -- but experts in the causes of war gave the report a chilly reception.For the paper, researchers analyzed 60 studies on historic empire collapses, recent wars, violent crime rates in the United States, lab simulations that tested police decisions on when to shoot and even cases where pitchers threw deliberately at batters in baseball. They found a common thread over centuries: Extreme weather \u2014 very hot or dry \u2014 means more violence.The authors say the results show strong evidence that climate can promote conflict.[pullquote]\"When the weather gets bad we tend to be more willing to hurt other people,\" said economist Solomon Hsiang of the University of California, Berkeley.He is the lead author of the study, published online Thursday by the journal  Experts in the causes of war gave it a mixed reception.Joshua Goldstein, a professor of international relations at American University and author of \"Winning the War on War,\" found faults with the way the study measured conflicts. He said the idea of connecting hotter tempers with hotter temperatures is only one factor in conflict, and that it runs counter to a long and large trend to less violence.\"To read this you get the impression, if climate change unfolds as we all fear it will, that the world will be beset by violent conflict and that's probably not true,\" Goldstein said.In the paper, the team of economists came up with a formula that predicts how much the risk of different types of violence should increase with extreme weather. In war-torn parts of equatorial Africa, it says, every added degree Fahrenheit or so increases the chance of conflict between groups \u2014 rebellion, war, civil unrest \u2014 by 11 percent to 14 percent. For the United States, the formula says that for every increase of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit, the likelihood of violent crime goes up 2 percent to 4 percent.Temperatures in much of North America and Eurasia are likely to go up by that 5.4 degrees by about 2065 because of increases in carbon dioxide pollution, according to a separate paper published in  on Thursday -- although many scientists take issue with that conclusion as well.The same paper sees global averages increasing by about 3.6 degrees in the next half-century. So that implies essentially about 40 percent to 50 percent more chance for African wars than it would be without global warming, said Edward Miguel, another Berkeley economist and study co-author.When the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) updates its report next year on the impacts of global warming, it will address the issue of impacts on war for the first time, said Carnegie Institution scientist Chris Field, who heads that worldwide study group. The new study is likely to play a big role, he said.Hsiang said that whenever the analyzed studies looked at temperature and conflict, the link was clear, no matter where or when. His analysis examines about a dozen studies on collapses of empires or dynasties, about 15 studies on crime and aggression and more than 30 studies on wars, civil strife or intergroup conflicts.Goldstein noted a wide array of factors beyond climate that lead to the growth of war -- or cause hot heads to cool down.\"Because of positive changes in technology, economics, politics and health\" conflict is likely to continue to drop, he said, although maybe not as much as it would without climate change.There's a good reason why people get more aggressive in warmer weather, said Ohio State University psychology professor Brad Bushman, who wasn't part of the study but whose work on crime and heat was analyzed by Hsiang.

{"id": null, "body": "The latest National Climate Assessment concludes that without 'substantial and sustained global mitigation,' climate change will cause 'growing losses to American infrastructure and property' and impede the 'rate of economic growth'; Ellison Barber reports.The White House on Friday released a federal report that found that the impacts of climate change are being felt across the country, and \u201cextreme weather and climate-related events\u201d are going to worsen in the years to come -- with a significant impact on the economy.The National Climate Assessment finds that extreme weather disasters \u201c\"have already become more frequent, intense, widespread or of long duration and have cost the the U.S. nearly $400 billion since 2015.\u201dThe report is mandated every four\u00a0years and is based on previous research. Its aim is to detail how climate change is affecting\u00a0the U.S. and how it is impacting the economy. It is written by outside scientists and officials from 13 federal agencies.\u201cWithout more significant global greenhouse gas mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause substantial losses to infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century,\u201d the report says, arguing that sectors that require national resources and favorable climates -- such as agriculture, tourism and fishing, are particularly vulnerable.The report also finds that the U.S. will be 3-12 degrees hotter by the end of the century, depending on how much greenhouse gas is released into the atmosphere. It also says that\u00a0more than 90 percent of current warming is caused by humans.It is unclear how the report will be greeted by the Trump administration, and particularly the White House. President Trump has been vocal in his skepticism about man-made climate change and the effects it is allegedly having both on temperatures and extreme weather events. He also pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord.Trump seemed to take a knock at those calling for action over climate change this week, when he noted that a cold blast was set to hit the U.S.\u201cWhatever happened to Global Warming?\u201d he asked.The report was initially set to be released in December. The White House\u2019s decision to instead release the report on Black Friday\u00a0was likely to lead to accusations that the administration was attempting to dump the report on a day many Americans were not\u00a0engaged in the news cycle.Study co-author Andrew Light, an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute, told The Associated Press that the release \u201c \"is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying but suppressing the best of climate science.\u201dAl Gore, the\u00a02000 Democratic presidential nominee and climate activist, accused President Trump of attempting to \"hide the truth.\"However, David Reidmiller, the director of the assessment, said the timing was in order to have the report come out ahead of U.N. climate talks, which begin in Poland on December 2, .The report comes just as California has been tackling devastating wildfires that have\u00a0killed at least 84 people. President Trump has said that better forest management could have helped limit the blaze.This week  \u201cradical environmentalists\u201d for making the fires worse, saying that a complicating matter was \"lawsuit after lawsuit by, yes, the radical environmental groups that would rather burn down the entire forest than cut a single tree or thin the forest.\u201dBut the report issued Friday said that \u201cwarmer and drier conditions have contributed to an increase in large forest fires in the western United States and interior Alaska.\u201dAdam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, with a focus on immigration.

{"id": null, "body": "  Hungry tourists stream into the glass-fronted balcony of Michael Recktenwald's restaurant on the German island of Langeoog, with its splendid view of the North Sea and the blue skies above.The 49-year-old has lived on Langeoog for most of his life, and his wife's family has been there for generations, but Recktenwald fears their children may not be able to stay if the world keeps on warming.Concerns about climate change have prompted mass protests across Europe for the past year. For the first time, the issue is expected to have a significant impact on this week's elections for the European Parliament.Recktenwald pointed to the damaged levees protecting the island, which is part of the Frisian Archipelago off the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Islands like Langeoog are among the regions most vulnerable to the rising sea levels predicted to result from climate change.\"The sea level has already risen and storm surges are getting more violent,\" he told The Associated Press. \"The chain of dunes is being attacked more strongly, endangering our freshwater supply.\"A recent opinion poll in Germany showed that climate change has overtaken immigration as the issue voters in the EU's most populous nation are most concerned about. Elsewhere across the EU, climate change also features prominently among the top issues \u2014 along with immigration and the economy \u2014 ahead of the European Parliament vote that began Thursday and runs through Sunday in all of the bloc's 28 nations.\"In many countries, the climate issue has become increasingly one of the top issues that voters are concerned about when they talk about European issues,\" said Derek Beach, a political scientist at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. \"In Denmark, for example, this year it's really almost the only issue that people are talking about in relation to the European Parliament election.\"Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg inspired a 'Fridays for Future' school strikes movement in her native Sweden that's spread across Europe, bringing tens of thousands to the streets demanding faster action on climate change. The Extinction Rebellion direct action group upended traffic across London for days to press the point. Both cite spiking temperature records and dramatic warnings from scientists as reasons to act now to fight global warming.Yet what remains an abstract threat to most Europeans has become very real to Recktenwald.\"We're directly affected,\" he said, walking past beachgoers enjoying the sun from behind the wicker windbreaks that are a signature of German coastal resorts.Together with eight other families elsewhere in the world and a Scandinavian youth group, the Recktenwalds launched a legal action to force the European Union to set more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A court rejected their case on procedural grounds Wednesday, but the plaintiffs plan to appeal.In the meantime, Recktenwald \u2014 who doesn't belong to any political party \u2014 is hoping that European leaders listen to voters who want their governments and the EU to take decisive action against global warming.Parties that have traditionally championed environmental causes, such as the Greens in Germany, are well-placed to benefit from the growing concern about climate change. The party clocked an unprecedented 19% support in Germany in a survey published last week, overtaking the center-left Social Democrats that are part of Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition.\"We are very optimistic that we will achieve the largest parliamentary group we have ever had in the European Parliament,\" said Ska Keller, one of two leading candidates for the European Greens.\"The climate issue is now finally on everyone's lips, a subject that we have been credibly promoting for many decades,\" she added. \"We have very concrete proposals for what we want to do against the climate crisis, for the preservation of biodiversity, for the preservation of our environment.\"The Greens had 52 seats in the last EU legislature, making it fourth biggest political grouping, and are expected to gain more of the European Parliament's 751 total seats.Other parties, too, have been waking up to the issue of global warming.Merkel's center-right Union bloc has pledged to implement the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to keep average temperatures increases worldwide well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times. But the party, like many others, has hesitated when it comes to backing tough measures scientists say are necessary to drastically curb greenhouse gas emissions, such as adding a climate tax to fossil fuels.In France, raising gas taxes sparked nationwide protests and created the yellow vest movement for economic justice, whose weekly protests since November, especially in Paris, have often turned violent. That has made other European governments leery of openly backing such a move. Some right-wing parties are attacking the science of global warming in an effort to win voters fearing the economic consequences of combating climate change.Experts say the EU as a whole is possibly a better place for making decisions on climate change than its national governments.\"This is probably one of the easiest things for most voters to see something that only Europe can deal with,\" said Beach.Still, climate change may seem like a luxury issue for voters in struggling economies such as Italy, he said.\"When your 20-something kids are both unemployed, then you would definitely perhaps be a little bit more concerned about that kind of economic bread-and butter-issue,\" Beach said.Uwe Garrels, the mayor of Langeoog, is well aware of the tension between environmental protection and economic prosperity.The island, a half hour's ferry ride from the German mainland, was poor until tourism brought jobs. Now about 1,800 permanent residents and 2,400 seasonal workers look after more than 10,000 visitors during the summer months.Despite a drought last year, locals are unwilling to give up their lush lawns for fear of spoiling the island's idyllic image.Garrels suggests that Langeoog, a 20-square kilometer (7.7-square mile) island in the heart of a World Heritage site with car-free streets and clean air, can at least help make visitors more environmentally aware.\"We can't be viewed in isolation to the entire country or the whole EU,\" he said. \"You can't create an oasis of sustainability on Langeoog if that's not the case in the rest of the country.\"Recktenwald, the restaurant owner, hopes the EU election will spur tougher top-down climate action.\"If we do nothing,\" he said, \"then my children will probably experience not being able to live here anymore. That's relatively certain.\"___For more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections, go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament", "headline": "Climate change is hot topic in the European Parliament vote", "article_name": "climate-change-is-hot-topic-in-the-european-parliament-vote", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/world/climate-change-is-hot-topic-in-the-european-parliament-vote", "date_published": "2019-05-24 00:00:00", "article_length": 6894, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:19:22.677393"}

The findings were published in the journal .\"We know that biodiversity is suffering under climate change, but the specific causes and sensitivities are hard to pin down,\" said Research group leader Prof Matt Gage in a . \"We've shown in this work that sperm function is an especially sensitive trait when the environment heats up, and in a model system representing a huge amount of global biodiversity.\"Gage continued: \"Since sperm function is essential for reproduction and population viability, these findings could provide one explanation for why biodiversity is suffering under climate change. A warmer atmosphere will be more volatile and hazardous, with extreme events like heatwaves becoming increasingly frequent, intense and widespread.\"The researchers looked at the red flour beetle to get the effects of simulated heatwaves on male reproduction. They were exposed to standard control conditions or a five-day heatwave where the temperatures ranged between 5\u00b0C and 7\u00b0C \"above their thermal optimum,\" the statement added.As a result, the researchers learned that the climate-controlled group had no problems reproducing, but those that were exposed to the harsher conditions suffered serious setbacks. The heatwaves \"halved\" the number of offspring produced and a second heatwave almost caused them to become sterile.\"Heatwaves are particularly damaging extreme weather events,\" Gage added in the statement. \"Local extinctions are known to occur when temperature changes become too intense. We wanted to know why this happens. And one answer could be related to sperm.\"After the rise in temperatures, sperm count fell by three-quarters and \"any sperm produced then struggled to migrate into the female tract and were more likely to die before fertilization,\" according to the statement.Females, however, were not affected by the warmer conditions.\"Our research shows that heatwaves halve male reproductive fitness, and it was surprising how consistent the effect was,\" said Kirs Sales, a postgraduate researcher who led the research.While concerning in the short-term, there are significant longer-term implications as well, with Sales citing \u00a0\"the impacts of heatwaves on future generations.\"\"When males were exposed to two heatwave events 10 days apart, their offspring production was less than 1 percent of the control group,\" Sales said. \"Insects in nature are likely to experience multiple heatwave events, which could become a problem for population productivity if male reproduction cannot adapt or recover.\"Of the offspring that did survive, they lived a shorter life-span, up to a few months shorter, the researcher found. There were also problems with male offspring, as some were found to be less fertile as a result of their fathers' exposure to the heatwave-like conditions.Beetles are believed to represent a quarter of biodiversity, Sales added, making these results concerning for how other species will react to climate change.\"Research has also shown that heat shock can damage male reproduction in warm-blooded animals too, and past work has shown that this leads to infertility in mammals,\" Sales added.", "headline": "Climate change could damage men's ability to procreate, study says", "article_name": "climate-change-could-damage-mens-ability-to-procreate", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-could-damage-mens-ability-to-procreate", "date_published": "2018-11-13 00:00:00", "article_length": 3441, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:19:23.696218"}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., was\u00a0set to introduce a non-binding resolution in Congress to declare a \u201cclimate emergency\" that calls for a \"massive-scale mobilization to halt, reverse, and address its consequences and causes.\"Ocasio-Cortez said that the U.S. has fewer than 12 years to act to combat the crisis, and echoed Sanders\u2019 sentiment that it was a question of political will, rather than how to act.\u201cWe know that the scientific consensus is here, the solutions are right in front of us but...this is not just a scientific crisis, not just an environmental crisis, a climate crisis but this is a political crisis of inaction, and it\u2019s going to take political will, political courage in order for us to treat us this issue with the urgency that the next generation needs in order for us to preserve our way of life and preserve our planet as much as we possibly can,\" she said.The resolution calls for a wide-scale to combat the emergency and restore the climate \u201cfor future generations.\u201d\u201cThe global warming caused by human activities,\u201d claims the draft resolution, according to the  magazine, \u201chas resulted in a climate emergency that \u2026 demands a national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization of the resources and labor of the United States at a massive-scale.\u201dOcasio-Cortez and Blumenauer, meanwhile, also wrote to fellow members of Congress urging them to declare climate change an emergency in a bid to \u201cswiftly mobilize federal resources in response.\u201dThe resolution, according to the outlet, details how climate change impacts public health and the national security of the U.S., though it doesn\u2019t make any exact recommendations for how to address the so-called emergency.The latest declaration from Democrats comes after Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s signature Green New Deal, a sweeping Democratic proposal for dealing with climate change, failed a test vote in the U.S. Senate in March, with 42 Democrats and Sanders voting \u201cpresent.\u201dRep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, dismissed the resolution as a political stunt.\u201cAfter six months in the majority, House Democrats have made no legislative progress on addressing climate change; so, they\u2019ve resorted to political stunts. Where are the results? If the Green New Deal is their solution, then they should hold a hearing,\" he said in a statement.\u00a0\"Congressional hearings with climate change in the title is not progress; let\u2019s work together on commonsense solutions to produce real results. We need to continue our thoughtful and measured approach to reduce our emissions, boost clean energy production, and protect America\u2019s economy and workers.\u201dBoth the New York Democrat and her colleagues decried Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s move to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote, saying the Republicans purposely rushed the vote while McConnell said he only wanted Democrats to go on record to support the sweeping proposal that he himself called \u201ca radical, top-down, socialist makeover of the entire U.S. economy.\u201dThe Green New Deal calls for the U.S. to shift away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power. It calls for virtual elimination by 2030 of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming. Republicans have railed against the proposal, saying it would devastate the economy and trigger massive tax increases.Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, with a focus on immigration.

Our study suggests that climate change may have had an important role in the Neanderthal extinction.\u201dDr. Ersek and his team looked at the stalagmites\u2014rocks that gather in caves for long stretches of time \u2014to look at the climate. Stalagmites contain rings, similar to trees, which can give an indication of how extreme weather patterns, occurring over thousands of years, impacted Neanderthals.The study was published in the  .Neanderthals existed on Eurasia for approximately 350,000 years. But during the time of the last Ice Age and the arrival of modern humans in Europe, they became extinct.During cold periods of time, the team found a \"near complete absence\" of archaeological artifacts from the group, suggesting cooler temperatures meant fewer tools.Though Neanderthals had learned to control and manipulate fire, just like modern humans, Neanderthals did not incorporate fish and plants into their diet, giving them fewer food sources.As temperatures became colder and these animals naturally became more scarce during the freezing temperatures, Neanderthals became more susceptible to climate change.\u201cBefore now, we did not have climate records from the region where Neanderthals lived which had the necessary age accuracy and resolution to establish a link between when Neanderthals died out and the timing of these extreme cold periods,\u201d Dr. Ersek added. \u201cBut our findings indicate that the Neanderthal populations successively decreased during the repeated cold stadials.\"A stadial is a period of colder climate; conversely, an interstadial is a period of warmer climate.When temperatures started to warm up again, Neanderthals were left with a doomed fate, according to Dr. Ersek. \"[Their smaller populations could not expand as their habitat was also being occupied by modern humans and this facilitated a staggered expansion of modern humans into Europe.\u201d", "headline": "Climate change killed off Neanderthals, study says", "article_name": "climate-change-killed-off-neanderthals-study-says", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/climate-change-killed-off-neanderthals-study-says", "date_published": "2018-08-30 00:00:00", "article_length": 2701, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:19:27.642215"}

It was , who has brought the American people massive job creation, a stronger economy, lower taxes and a booming energy sector that has put us on the road to energy independence.I predict that millions of voters who learned about the  will have no choice but to turn to Trump to avoid the disaster those plans would bring.Another winner on Wednesday night was renewable energy, which was supported by all the Democratic candidates at the town halls \u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; businessman Andrew Yang; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.And there were two big losers of the night.First, science. It was replaced by magical thinking on the part of the 10 Democratic candidates, who believe they can translate the hopes and dreams of environmental zealots into reality.The other big loser was the American people \u2013 who have no choice on the Democratic side for a candidate who advocates sound environmental policies based on reality that will not cripple our economy and throw millions of people out of work.All of the candidates promised \u201cgreen jobs. All of them claimed their policies will create opportunities across America. But future promises pale in comparison to reality.Under President Trump we have record-high employment and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. We have cheap energy \u2013 compared to the \u201cgreen\u201d energy in Europe where people pay three and four times much as we do utility costs.Our abundant fossil fuels mean that despite hurricanes and Iranian hostility, gasoline prices remained very low even at the height of summer.Democrats embrace a doomsday clock ticking to 2030 \u2013 saying we must get off fossil fuels by then. This is a constant fearmongering tactic that Americans are tired of. We aren\u2019t ready to surrender our jobs, our steaks, our cars, our air-conditioning and heat for a socialist power grab. Americans want to be winners.The Green New Deal, climate hysteria and all 10 candidates cannot make Americans believe what science, math and history show to be true.While it\u2019s true that the green energy the Democratic candidates embrace holds a lot of potential and has a bright future years from now, all of the candidates ignored a few inconvenient truths, if I may borrow a phrase for former Vice President Al Gore.First, keep in mind that the president of the United States is not a dictator. Many of the proposals by the Democratic candidates are sure to run into resistance by Republicans and even many Democrats in Congress. So just because a new president says he or she wants to take certain actions to fight climate change doesn\u2019t mean Congress will authorize and fund them.Second, green technology is completely  by tax subsidies, and cannot survive in the marketplace without them. The candidates glossed over how to raise the trillions of dollars needed to fund these subsidies \u2013 a critical problem with various versions of the Green New Deal and even less ambitious programs.It\u2019s like saying you\u2019d like to buy a $20 million mansion for your family \u2013 and will worry later about how to pay for it.We have to face the facts: There aren\u2019t enough \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d \u2013 the group demonized by so many of the Democratic candidates \u2013 to pick up the tab for the green revolution the presidential hopefuls want to fund.The green revolution would require massive tax increases on all of us \u2013 taking a lot of green out of our wallets and crippling consumer spending that fuels our economy and creates jobs.The candidates and moderators also completely ignored the fact that green technology is not at all \u201cgreen.\u201d It requires tremendous amounts of fossil fuels, and particularly the most targeted: .Coal forges steel \u2013 900 tons of which is required for each wind turbine. Coal is the main ingredient in concrete \u2013 2,500 tons of which is required to anchor each wind turbines. In other words, without coal we do not have wind power.The other panacea of the greener tomorrow is electric vehicles. Teslas, like all\u00a0electric vehicles,\u00a0are\u00a0\u00a0on enormous tax subsidies to make them affordable to consumers. And it is curious, maybe even unfair, that at\u00a0the same time,\u00a0taxpayers provide thousands of dollars to purchase these cars, Tesla\u2019s founder has  a multibillionaire without incurring the wrath of any candidate. And Teslas, just like all electric vehicles, need to be forged with steel. Which requires coal.Electric vehicles also require tremendous amounts of rare earth elements, most of which are not found in America, requiring  to play ball. If we force consumers to only buy electric vehicles, we are basically building China\u2019s economy \u2013 just like we did when we moved manufacturing out of the Rust Belt.On top of this, while electric vehicles don\u2019t emit carbon dioxide, many power plants producing electricity run on fossil fuels. Replacing all those power plants would be an enormously expensive undertaking. And many Democrats oppose a massive turn to nuclear power, which emits no carbon dioxide but faces opposition because of safety concerns and concerns about disposing of atomic waste. Finally, another loser in the very long night of political spin was Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, who lost his battle to keep a climate debate out of the Democratic primary process.The American people are on a figurative first date with the 2020\u00a0presidential candidates right now. You never want to show your crazy side on a first date.After the long night of the Democratic environmental talkfest, we should be skeptical about another date with any of these candidates.", "headline": "Daniel Turner: Winners and losers from Democrats' climate change town hall", "article_name": "democrats-climate-change-town-hall-winner-loser-daniel-turner", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-climate-change-town-hall-winner-loser-daniel-turner", "date_published": "2019-09-05 00:00:00", "article_length": 6266, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:19:29.748792"}

(REUTERS/Lucas Jackson) Earth could turn into a hothouse planet like Venus, with boiling oceans and acid rain, if humans don't curb irreversible climate change, physicist Stephen Hawking claimed in a recent interview.\"We are close to the tipping point, where  becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like , with a temperature of 250 degrees [Celsius], and raining sulfuric acid,\" he told , referring to the president's decision .But most climate experts say that scenario is a dramatic and implausible exaggeration: Relative to Venus, planet Earth is much farther from the sun and given its chemical makeup will never have such a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, so it could not likely reach temperatures of 482 degrees Fahrenheit (250 degrees C) that Hawking described in the interview, they say. []However, the general trend of runaway and catastrophic climate change is a real concern, experts said.\"Hawking is taking some rhetorical license here,\" Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University, told Live Science in an email. \"Earth is further away from the sun than Venus and likely cannot experience a runaway  in the same sense as Venus \u2014 i.e. a literal boiling away of the oceans. However Hawking's larger point \u2014 that we could render the planet largely uninhabitable for human civilization if we do not act to avert dangerous climate change \u2014 is certainly valid.\"Venus is the second planet from the sun and the brightest planet in the solar system; though the planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and desire, don't expect to take a trip to the balmy planet with your sweetheart anytime soon. Despite being the same size as Earth and having roughly the same  as our home planet, it's a far cry from our water-drenched planet. Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with temperatures reaching 870 degrees F (466 degrees C). The reason for these sweltering temperatures is Venus' thick carbon-dioxide atmosphere that is dotted with sulfuric acid clouds; the atmosphere traps much more heat than our own does. It is also much closer to the sun, meaning it absorbs much more solar radiation than Earth. Churning volcanoes add to Venus' reputation as an inferno. []The leading theory about how Venus came to be such a hellscape is that the planet got caught in a feedback loop, wherein the planet absorbed more solar radiation than it released, causing more water vapor to get trapped in its atmosphere. That, in turn, led to greater heat absorption, and runaway warming (also called a runaway greenhouse effect).\"Basically, Venus was in a state of heat stroke \u2014 the planet was in a warming state and it couldn't cool down,\" said Tyler Robinson, an astrobiologist at the University of Washington.Though most humans take for granted the relative constancy of an Earth-like climate, our planet has undergone dramatic changes in its 4.5-billion-year history. During the , around 2.5 billion years ago, photosynthetic cyanobacteria fueled a huge rise in oxygen in the atmosphere. Around 650 million years ago, the entire planet froze, in a phenomenon known as \" snowball Earth .\" And during the dinosaur age, the planet was, on average 18 degrees F (10 degrees C) hotter than it is now, with a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. And huge \"carbon excursions\" have led to massive extinctions in the past \u2014 such as the end-Permian extinction around 252 million years ago, when roughly 95 percent of sea life died out due to ocean acidification. [ Photo Timeline: How the Earth Formed ]So it's not unreasonable to contemplate the possibility of a runaway climate scenario, Robinson said. Still, most experts, including Robinson, see that possibility as incredibly unlikely.While in theory, a process similar to the one experienced on Venus could take place on Earth, the process would most likely occur over hundreds of millions of years, most experts believe, Robinson said. There are also very low odds that Earth's oceans could literally boil away like Venus' primeval oceans did, Robinson said.Earth, meanwhile, is protected from solar radiation by an atmosphere that is dramatically different from that of Venus.\"Venus' atmosphere is about 100 times thicker than Earth's atmosphere, and composed almost entirely of CO2 [carbon dioxide],\" Robinson said. By contrast, Earth's atmosphere is mostly molecular nitrogen and oxygen, with less than 0.04 percent coming from carbon dioxide, Robinson told Live Science in an email. [ Infographic: Earth's Atmosphere from Top to Bottom ]Without a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and the extra dose of solar radiation from the sun, only willful malice is likely to cause a runaway greenhouse scenario, said Kevin Zahnle, a space scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, who has analyzed runaway greenhouse projections for the planet.\"There is no rational expectation of a runaway [greenhouse effect] in the facts as we know them,\" Zahnle told Live Science in an email.For one, there were much warmer climates on Earth in the relatively recent past, such as during the Eocene epoch (between 56 million and 34 million years ago), and no signs of a runaway greenhouse effect, Zahnle said. At that time, CO2 levels were likely three times higher than they are now. Even imagining a future with cars, planes and air conditioning on full blast, no climate projections predict such high levels of CO2 in our atmosphere, he said.\"A runaway greenhouse effect is not in the cards,\" added Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.Of course, there is always the possibility of deliberate sabotage, Zahnle said.\"Dr. Evil might consider an engineering solution akin to the engineering solutions proposed to terraform Mars , but the scale of the effort would be stupendous,\" Zahnle said. \"You'd need fluorocarbons \u2014 so Dr. Evil would need to create a worldwide religion dedicated to the sacred use of hairspray and underarm deodorants,\" Zahnle said. (In the past, some consumer aerosol products contained fluorocarbons, though the U.S. has banned the ingredients in the late 1970s.)Nontheless, Earth doesn't have to become like Venus for life on Earth to become hellish.The Paris Agreement aimed to keep warming below 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) compared with preindustrial temperatures, but even reaching that level for sustained periods could cause changes that are already underway to completely disrupt ecosystems and farming, Trenberth told Live Science. [ Trump Pulls Out of Paris Climate Deal: 5 Likely Effects ]\"Trees will still grow but a different species is required. Or farming requires different crops,\" Trenberth said. \"That threatens the water and food supply.\"Food and water don't need to vanish, they just need to fall below demand and chaos breaks out, he said. \"This sort of thing is increasingly likely after about 2050, as it is likely we will go through 2 degrees Celsius during that decade,\" Trenberth said.It is also theoretically possible for CO2 levels to go even higher, Robinson said. If humans were to burn every last bit of fossil fuel on the planet, CO2 levels could rise to almost 10 times their current levels, Robinson said.\"Earth hasn't experienced CO2 levels this high in hundreds of millions of years, and the resulting sea-level change is likely hundreds of feet, so, say 'so long' to all your favorite coastal cities,\" Robinson said.", "headline": " Stephen Hawking: Earth could turn into hothouse planet like Venus ", "article_name": "stephen-hawking-earth-could-turn-into-hothouse-planet-like-venus", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/stephen-hawking-earth-could-turn-into-hothouse-planet-like-venus", "date_published": "2017-09-27 00:00:00", "article_length": 7626, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T08:26:27.244249"}

[]\"Fifty inches of rain in Houston!\" Tyson said, according to CNN. \"This is a shot across our bow, a hurricane the width of Florida going up the center of Florida!\"Research shows that human-caused climate change can make storms more extreme than they would be otherwise, . But humankind has been slow to curb the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, Tyson said, adding that the longer people take to respond to climate change, the bleaker the outcome for humanity gets.\"I worry that we might not be able to recover from this, because all our greatest cities are on the oceans and water's edges, historically for commerce and transportation,\" Tyson said on CNN.These cities will be the first to go as water levels rise, Tyson said. \"And we don't have a system \u2014 we don't have a civilization with the capacity to pick up a city and move it inland 20 miles [32 kilometers],\" he said. \"This  than our ability to respond. That could have huge economic consequences.\"Tyson's assessment of climate change's role in intensifying the recent hurricanes is spot-on, said Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University.\"There are theoretical reasons to expect that the strongest storms will increase in intensity as sea-surface temperatures increase, and this is indeed being observed,\" Mann told Live Science in an email.For instance, for every 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.56 degrees Celsius) of ocean warming, there has been about a 10 mph (16 km/h) increase in maximum sustained winds among Category 4 and , Mann said.This is bad news for coastal cities: These faster winds correspond to a roughly 20 percent increase in wind damage, Mann said.Human-caused climate change has heated not only the land but also the ocean, . Warmer oceans have consequences \u2014 \"a warmer ocean surface means more moisture content and more rainfall with these storms, and global sea-level rise has increased the coastal flooding associated with these storms,\" Mann said.If people don't do enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Earth continues to warm, \"then I do believe that we are talking about a situation where we will literally be retreating from the coastline and relocating the major coastal cities of the world \u2014 a daunting and extremely expensive proposition,\" Mann said.Other researchers say there is a strong link between Hurricane Harvey's extreme rainfall and climate change; heavy-precipitation events have increased in recent decades, and several were shown to be more likely because of climate change, ", "headline": "Neil deGrasse Tyson says human-caused climate change could doom coastal cities", "article_name": "neil-degrasse-tyson-says-human-caused-climate-change-could-doom-coastal-cities", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/neil-degrasse-tyson-says-human-caused-climate-change-could-doom-coastal-cities", "date_published": "2017-09-19 00:00:00", "article_length": 3200, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T08:26:27.819118"}

Environment Program said in a report Friday.The report said better management of forests, more careful agricultural practices and the restoration of peatlands could soak up significant amounts of carbon dioxide, the most common of the gases blamed for global warming.\"We need to move toward a comprehensive policy framework for addressing ecosystems,\" said co-author Barney Dickson, releasing the report at the U.N. climate negotiations in Bonn, . The event was Webcast worldwide.Millions of dollars are being invested in research on capturing and burying carbon emissions from power stations, but investing in ecosystems could achieve cheaper results, the report said.It also would have the added effects of preserving biodiversity, improving water supplies and boosting livelihoods.Halving deforestation by mid-century and maintaining that lower rate for another 50 years would save the equivalent of five years of carbon emissions at the current level, said Dickson, the agency's head of climate change and biodiversity.The loss of peatlands, mainly drained for palm oil and pulp wood plantations in Southeast Asia, contributes 8 percent of global carbon emissions.  could capture about 5 percent of its carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels by returning straw to croplands, it said.Agriculture has the largest potential for storing carbon if farmers use better techniques, such as avoiding turning over the soil and using natural compost and manure rather than chemical fertilizers, it said.", "headline": "U.N.: Nature Best at Handling Climate Change", "article_name": "u-n-nature-best-at-handling-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/u-n-nature-best-at-handling-climate-change", "date_published": "2015-06-22 00:00:00", "article_length": 1601, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T08:27:05.300536"}
