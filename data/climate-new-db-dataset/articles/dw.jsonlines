{"id": null, "body": "     With Germany set to miss its climate goals by a wide margin, a solution might be right next door. The Netherlands recently revealed a wide-ranging climate deal \u2014 including a carbon tax that Dutch companies agreed to pay. Flanked by a team of ministers, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Thursday to discuss his country's plan to combat climate change. Both countries are lagging behind on their emissions targets, but Germany in particular is struggling to meet its goals. So far, Germany has reduced its greenhouse gas output by around 32% since 1990, but is likely to fall well short of the 40% target it set for 2020. At home, Merkel has struggled to find a compromise between appeasing industry leaders and and taking on more drastic measures \u2014\u00a0like a carbon tax \u2014 that her environment minister \u00a0and climate activists say are necessary to prevent a global climate catastrophe. In June, the Netherlands revealed its national climate accord after months of hammering out details in talks with industry and society stakeholders. The plan includes a goal to cut emissions by 49% by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2050. As Merkel's government draws closer to revealing its own package of climate measures in September, DW has taken a look at the Dutch accord to see what tips Germany could borrow: Electricity By the 2050 deadline, the Netherlands wants to make its electricity production entirely carbon neutral \u2014 phasing out coal over the next few years and closing the first coal-fired plant by 2020. By 2030, the country hopes to generate 70% of its electricity from renewable sources, boosting offshore windfarms as well as expanding wind turbines and solar farms on land. \"Why study, if our future is being destroyed?\" This sign features a sentiment shared by increasing numbers of German students, who have joined young people worldwide in using Friday school strikes to call for action on climate change. The movement was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began her protests alone in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. With the 2015 Paris climate accord, nearly all of the world's countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), by 2100. The hope is that this target will prevent the worst effects of climate disasters. Concerned by the dire predictions from climate scientists, more and more people have called for immediate action. Despite urgent warnings, politicians have dragged their heels on important climate decisions. It's become clear that Germany will miss its targets for 2020. Climate protection was an important factor in the European elections in late May, with the Greens winning more than 20% of the vote in Germany alone, more than double previous results. Among 18-24-year-olds, 34% backed the party. Germany's climate movement is fighting on many fronts. In recent years, activists have fought to preserve Hambach Forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, building treehouses to prevent the old-growth forest from being felled to make way for the mining of lignite, or brown coal. Energy giant RWE has launched legal action, and police have cleared the camp several times. In September 2018, a few days after the camp was removed again, a court ruling suspended the clearing of the forest until late 2020, after a lawsuit by environmental group BUND. RWE has argued that the forest has to be cut in order to ensure the coal necessary for Germany's electricity supply. Around 50,000 activists celebrated the victory. Protests organized by groups such as Ende Gel\u00e4nde have increasingly been making headlines. Thousands of young activists have come out to staged events, blocking railway tracks used to deliver coal to power plants near Cologne and occupying huge coal excavators, as seen here in the open-pit mine in the east German town of Welzow in 2016. In January 2019, after seven months of negotiations, a coal commission set up by the federal government to work out Germany's plans to phase out coal power released its findings. It recommended that Germany should continue coal mining until 2038, at the latest \u2014far too late for the country to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris climate accord. An increasing number of young people in Germany are demanding that the government find a way to meet the 1.5-degree target. The emerging Fridays for Future movement has been getting support from longtime environmentalists, teachers, academics and parents. They have called for all German coal-fired power plants to be shut down by 2030, and for renewable energy initiatives to be vastly expanded. Author: Gero Rueter Carbon tax on industry One of the most controversial measures \u2014 and the one that has proved difficult to agree with industrial giants in Germany \u2014 is establishing a carbon tax. Starting in 2021, companies will be taxed \u20ac30 ($33) per ton of CO2 produced. That figure will rise to \u20ac125 to \u20ac150 per ton after 2030. There will also be subsidies to encourage companies to switch to renewable energy as well as funding to boost research into the use of hydrogen and other sustainable fuels. Overhauling homes By 2050, 7 million homes and 1 million office and industrial buildings need to be rid of natural gas. At least 1.5 million of those homes need to be gas-free by 2030. In order to accomplish this, homeowners and businesses will need to install better insulation and switch to renewable energy sources to heat and power their homes. The changes will be rolled out district by district, with neighborhood-wide consultations. The Dutch government has acknowledged that the initial costs of making the switch will be high \u2014 particularly with a new energy tax system \u2014 but say that\u00a0subsidies and lower energy bills will eventually offset the costs. Agriculture Innovative farming methods have helped the Netherlands become the second-largest exporter of agricultural products in the world . In order to make the sector carbon neutral, the government plans to implement better manure processing techniques to reduce emissions from livestock. Specific plans have been set out for the country's sprawling greenhouses, including plans to modernize 300 hectares (741 acres) of greenhouse space per year and utilize geothermal heat. Transportation All newly produced passenger cars must be emission-free by 2030, with the government offering incentives for electric vehicles. Some 1.8 million charging points are supposed to be built by 2030. Already known for being a country of avid cyclists, the Netherlands plans to implement more measures to encourage bike use, including setting up more bicycle parking at train stations. Although there is a combination of factors behind the numerous jellyfish that reach vacation havens like the Mediterranean coast, climate change is also partially to blame. Warmer sea temperatures are opening up new areas where jellyfish can reproduce, and increasing the availability of their favorite food: plankton. Prized for their superior sound quality, an original Stradivarius can sell for millions of dollars. Yet, extreme weather events, such as unusually violent storms, are killing millions of trees, putting at risk the famous wood in the Paneveggio forest, in northern Italy. Replanting trees won't help much in the short term. A spruce has to be at least 150 years old before it can become a violin. On very hot nights, people sleep worse, especially in big cities. By 2050 European metropolises may experience temperatures around 3.5 degrees Celsius warmer in summer. It not only affects sleep, but also mood, productivity and mental health. The only way to escape is to move to smaller towns and settlements, where the nights are cooler since there are fewer buildings and more greenery. Spring is starting earlier in the year due to global warmer temperatures \u2014 bad news for allergy sufferers. With a longer frost-free season, plants have more time to grow, bloom and produce pollen. Therefore, pollen will freely roam around much earlier, which will make the suffering season longer and the annual pollen load greater. Will it be the century of masks for air pollution and allergies? Heat not only makes us sweat; it also affects our health. By the end of this century three-quarters of the world's population is expected to be exposed to dangerous and deadly heat waves. Rising temperatures mean an increase in diarrheal diseases, as it's easier for bacteria to multiply in warm food and water. Mosquito numbers will also likely go up, along with the spread of diseases like malaria. Soil in the region around the North Pole is increasingly thawing in the summer months, with dramatic local and global consequences. Warmer temperatures cause floors to become unstable and houses and roads to crack, and leads to many more insects. Moreover, if permafrost \u2014 frozen soil \u2014 melts, it will release CO2 and methane gases that could further exacerbate global warming. It's a vicious circle. Temperature can influence the sex of several species. For sea turtles, the heat of the sand where the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the newborn. Low temperatures benefit male turtles, while females develop better in warmer areas. Researchers have found that over 99% of turtle hatchlings in northern Australia are already female, making it difficult for the species to survive.

{"id": null, "body": "     The new novel by award-winning Indian author Amitav Ghosh, Gun Island, uses climate change as a backdrop. He tells DW about the different perceptions of the climate crisis in the East and West. Amitav Ghosh says for some people climate catastrophe has already happened When he was a boy, Amitav Ghosh always knew where pineapples came from. \"They came from the garden, I would watch people chopping them up,\" he says, as if that wasn't anything special.\u00a0 His garden was in Kolkata, India, whereas my garden was in the suburbs of Manchester, England, and all it had in it was some grass, a tree, and an old football. Yet I still had pineapples \u2014 albeit usually chopped up in cans. I hardly ever thought about where they came from. Read more:\u00a0 Citizens' Assemblies: Time for the people to take control of the climate crisis? \u00a0 It'd take a while to explain how we got onto these fruit memories when I met the Indian author in his kitchen in Brooklyn this September. But that disjunction is one of the things behind\u00a0 The Great Derangement, Ghosh's book-length essay from 2016, subtitled Climate Change and the Unthinkable . The book starts out by wondering why\u00a0it is so difficult to get climate change into a modern English-language novel that isn't science fiction. It concludes that Western literature has, in the past 200 years or so, become trapped in a world where\u00a0human comedy and tragedy is separated from nature. Along the way, Ghosh considers the power dynamics that make the climate debate so different in the Eastern\u00a0than the Western hemisphere. Read more:\u00a0 Cities key to tackling climate crisis \u2013 global climate group \u00a0 Western novels, he believes, are mainly bound by two constraints: plausibility and human agency. Could this happen? And can our hero fight his way through his moral adventure? In some ways, his new novel, Gun Island , full of freak typhoons and unlikely coincidences, is a conscious attempt to break free of those conventions, and so finds room to use climate change as a backdrop.\u00a0 Amitav Ghosh says for some people the climate catastrophe has already arrived Crisis and realization The Great Derangement \u00a0is different from the other books about environmental doom that have come out in the last few years. David Wallace-Wells' The Uninhabitable Earth (2019)\u00a0and Paul Kingsnorth's Confessions of a Recovering Environmentalist (2017), for example, are vital books, but they're written by American and British men who have made a terrible realization and are now trying to figure out a way to cope.\u00a0 But Ghosh, no less aware of the existential threat, seems to be free from their anxiety. This is mainly because he thinks the current predicament says more about the continuities with colonial history than it does about some ruptured future. For some people in the world, the catastrophe has already happened.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0 India's ghost villages: Food and water scarcity forcing many to leave \u00a0 \"I have a philosopher friend who says: All projections of the future are fundamentally projections of power,\" he says. \"This is why it's almost always the white guys who make those projections, because they're really projecting a disappearance of power into the future. I don't know anything about the future.\" \"I come from a part of the world where we didn't have very rosy expectations of the world or the future,\" says Ghosh. \"We knew there would be a lot of upheavals, and we witnessed these upheavals at first hand, so in that sense I think Westerners had a belief in stability and the promise of the future that I didn't share.\" The West has also come to rely on what Ghosh calls \"an expert discourse\" from scientists. The result, he believes, is that science is giving fearful westerners a hope in business-friendly \"sustainable development,\" biofuels, or carbon-capture technology, which they think will save the system before it collapses.\u00a0 Increased wildfires, flooding, and drought are hitting poorer countries hardest Ghosh says farmers, fishermen, Inuit, indigenous peoples have seen climate change first-hand The alternative, a massive-scale economic adaptation to a new distribution of resources, is too scary to consider: The end of capitalism would be as bad as the end of the world.\u00a0 \"The people who saw the climate crisis first are at the absolute other end: farmers, fishermen, Inuit, indigenous peoples, forest peoples in India, and they've already had to adapt, mainly by moving, finding new livelihoods,\" says Ghosh. \"And indigenous peoples have already lived through the end of the world and found ways to survive.\" Empire Ghosh thinks it's no coincidence that the constraints of the bourgeois novel began to form at the same time as the West began to use fossil fuels to project its power around the world. Read more:\u00a0 Saving Mumbai's natural mangrove buffer against rising tides \u00a0 \"Climate change is absolutely an aspect of empire,\" he says. \"The British Empire was essentially built on fossil fuels: It was the British mastery of coal that gave it a huge military advantage over the rest of the world.\" That's also one reason why renewable energy is a threat to a system that the West has spent centuries building up and defending. \"One thing you can be sure of,\" Ghosh says. \"If renewables really were adopted at scale, it would completely shake up the global political order.\"\u00a0He argues that oil and gas have to flow through maritime chokepoints controlled by the US, Australia, Britain and\u00a0Canada, giving them a complete geopolitical advantage. Ghosh sees climate change as an aspect of empire Power and justice Looked at this way, it's no wonder the Western anxiety about climate change is focussed on social collapse and extinction. \"I think Western people sense that the entire order is changing in ways that are extremely threatening to them,\" says Ghosh. That's also why in the Eastern hemisphere, the issue of historical injustice is central to the issue of climate change. \"If you go to any Indonesian, or Indian, or Chinese, even people who are perfectly well aware of the climate threat, and say to them: 'why don't you immediately cut all your emissions?' What will you hear? The answer is always profoundly political, it's: 'The West made this problem, let them give everything up first. This is the terrible dilemma in which we're caught.\" Read more:\u00a0\u00a0 Climate change reinforces the world's inequalities Despite all the devastation that climate change is causing in the developing world, the assumption is that, when an ecological collapse comes, the wealth built up over centuries will provide a cushion.\u00a0 \"We're always told that rich countries will adapt better: I don't think that's actually true. I think countries with very complex systems, like the United States and in Europe, are in many ways much more fragile. Just consider food distribution.\" And that's how we got onto pineapples. It's easier to get them if they're in your garden. Of the 2 million-odd people who visit the Great Barrier Reef annually, a 2016 survey found that 69 percent were coming to see the UNESCO World Heritage site \"before it's too late.\" And no wonder. The IPCC says that even if we manage to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, 99 percent of the world's coral will be wiped out. Tourists can hasten their demise by touching or polluting reefs. And what's the carbon cost of flying to remote natural wonders under threat? A 2010 study found that the business of polar-bear safaris in Churchill, Canada, had an annual CO2 footprint of 20 megatons. Most visitors arrived by plane, and while 88 percent of them said humans were responsible for climate change, only 69 percent agreed that air travel was a contributing cause. Along with the polar bear, one of the most iconic images of climate change must be the dramatic curves of an iceberg sculpted by the warming atmosphere. Gliding between the melting giants on a cruise ship is a haunting experience that tourists will pay huge sums for. In the early 1990s just 5,000 people visited Antarctica each year, compared to over 46,000 in 2018. You don't have to go to the poles to see vanishing ice. Kilimanjaro's snowy peaks are a striking sight above the equatorial savannah of the national park, which generates \u20ac44 million ($50 million) from tourism annually. Many visitors climb to the Furtw\u00e4ngler Glacier \u2014 where 85 percent of the ice has vanished over the last century. The rest is unlikely to survive much beyond mid-century. When Montana's Glacier National Park opened in 1910, it boasted over 100 of the ice features from which it took its name. Now, there are fewer than two dozen. So dramatic is their retreat, that the park has become a center of climate science research. Some 3 million hikers and holidaymakers also visit the \"crown of the continent\" each year, soaking in the dying days of its ice-capped glory. The Maldives are the archetypal tourist paradise: 1,200 coral islands with white beaches rising just 2.5 meters above the turquoise waters. In 2017, the president decided to build new airports and megaresorts to accommodate seven times as many tourists, and use the revenue to build new islands and relocate communities. He has since been voted out of office and faces corruption charges. It's not just islands that are going under as sea levels rise. Wetlands like Florida's Everglades are disappearing too. Over the last century, around half the Everglades have been drained and turned over to agriculture. Now, saltwater is seeping into what's left, making it the only critically endangered World Heritage site in the United States. The Galapagos will be forever associated with Darwin, who realized their unique wildlife had evolved over countless generations in isolation. Today, they are besieged by visitors and environmental changes are happening too fast for species to adapt. Ocean warming has left iconic creatures like the marine iguana starving, while UNESCO lists tourism among the greatest threats to the archipelago.

{"id": null, "body": "     Activists are increasingly using litigation as a tool to influence climate action worldwide. Here's a look at some of the main tactics they're wielding to force change on fossil fuel firms and weak government policies. In 2019, Haana Edenshaw (left) and 15 others launched a lawsuit in Canada over personal injuries linked to climate change More than 700 climate lawsuits have been filed around the world since 2015, according to the Climate Change Litigation Databases . That's a huge increase, considering there have only been about 1,700 of these types of cases since the late 1980s, most of them in the US. In a recent long-running case, the Dutch Supreme Court \u2014 citing the European Convention on Human Rights \u2014 ruled in favor of environmental group the Urgenda Foundation and 900 citizens and ordered the Dutch government to reduce its greenhouse emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020. A few months later, the government announced \u20ac3 billion ($3.5 billion) in measures to drastically cut coal use and fund renewable energy projects. Read more: \u00a0 To accelerate climate action, citizens are suing governments Urgenda director Marjan Minnesma called it \"an enormous win,\" telling The Guardian that the move would show \"it is possible to use the law as a strategic instrument for change.\" Here's an overview of this tactic, and others, that environmentalists are using to force climate action. UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet believes the Urgenda case will set a precedent.\u00a0\"This landmark ruling provides a clear path forward for concerned individuals in Europe \u2014 and around the world \u2014 to undertake climate litigation in order to protect human rights,\" she said after the decision. The\u00a0International Bar Association even released a model statute for such cases challenging government failure to act on climate change in early 2020. Citizen groups have filed similar human rights cases in several EU countries over the past five years, including in France , Belgium and Ireland \u2014 the latter decided in the activists' favor in July 2020. In February 2020, a group of nine young Germans led by Fridays for Future activist Luisa Neubauer filed a human rights challenge to Germany's Federal Climate Protection Act (KSG). They're arguing\u00a0that these targets \u2014 which aim to reduce emissions by 55% over the next decade \u2014 don't go far enough. And in September 2020, six young Portuguese activists between the ages of 8 and 21 launched an unprecedented climate case at the European Court of Human Rights against the 27 EU member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. Backed by the Global Legal Action Network , their aim is to force the nations to respect the 2015 Paris climate agreement and cut their emissions at home and abroad, where their multinational companies operate. With many of the cases still ongoing, it's too soon for activists\u00a0to know whether their strategy will prove successful in the long run. But they say wins in Ireland and the Netherlands have given them hope. Another strategy focuses on the violation of Indigenous rights and racial discrimination, arguing that climate change exacerbates these contentious issues. In November 2020, a group of political parties backed by NGOs filed a complaint against the Brazilian government for alleged failures to curb deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, a major contributor to climate change. They argue that government inaction has \"violated the fundamental rights of Indigenous peoples\" present and future. The case was in part inspired by a 2018 ruling by Colombia's highest court ,\u00a0which found that the Colombian rainforest was entitled to \"protection, conservation, maintenance and restoration.\" Read more: \u00a0 Colombia's youth fighting for the Amazon \u2014 in the courts and on the streets Earlier in 2020, representatives of the Wet'suwet'en Indigenous group in British Columbia filed a legal challenge against the Canadian government for failing to meet its commitments under several climate accords since the late 1980s. \"None of Canada's international commitments [\u2026] even if met, would have or will enable it to make its equitable contribution to reducing global warming to non-catastrophic levels,\" they said, arguing that this failure had breached their constitutional and human rights. Legal challenges by Indigenous groups have met with less success over the years, especially in North America. But as the effects of climate change become more apparent, that could change. Activists and municipalities, especially in the US, are increasingly targeting major oil and gas companies directly, aiming in some cases to use awarded fines to fund climate mitigation plans. In early 2018, New York City took five of the world's largest oil companies \u2014 BP, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC \u2014 to court for billions of dollars in compensation for the effects of climate change. Referencing devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 , Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city was seeking damages to fund climate-resilient infrastructure and heat mitigation measures. \"The city is standing up and saying we will take our own action to protect our people,\" he told reporters. A federal judge threw out the lawsuit later that year, though the city has launched an appeal. Local cases like these have also gone international.\u00a0In 2015, Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya filed a claim against German electricity producer RWE, alleging it had \"willingly and knowingly\" contributed to climate change and was responsible for increased flooding caused by glacial melt near his mountain home. He has asked the court to order RWE to reimburse him for 0.47% of the costs he is expected to incur for flood protection \u2014 RWE's estimated share in global total emissions from 1751 to 2010. \"Fossil fuel companies, like tobacco companies before them, have allowed governments to pay for the harms caused by their products,\" Korey Silverman-Roati, a climate law fellow at the Sabin Center, told Bloomberg in a recent interview. \"As climate harms and costs continue to rise, more jurisdictions are likely to attempt to recoup their costs in court, and the pressure on courts to apportion those costs in a just way will only grow.\" Chevron, Exxon Mobil and other fossil fuel companies are tied up in another climate case on the US West Coast, where a fishing industry trade group took them to court in late 2018 for damaging their \"productive livelihood and way of life.\" The fishers allege the oil giants have contributed to increased ocean temperatures which have led to prolonged closures of the Dungeness crab fisheries, \"the most lucrative and reliable fisheries on the West Coast.\" Also in 2018, a group of families from across the EU, Kenya and Fiji filed a lawsuit against the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union for failing to protect citizens from the impacts of climate change and the threat to their livelihood. Among the plaintiffs are lavender farmers from France, beekeepers in Portugal, an Italian family who works in the Alpine winter tourism industry and a group of Indigenous Sami youth from Sweden, who fear their reindeer herding culture is at risk. The group claims the EU's existing climate targets don't protect fundamental \"rights to life, health, occupation and property.\" The goal of court cases like this isn't always to win \u2014 in fact, the plaintiffs in the EU case aren't seeking compensation. Stefan K\u00fcper, press spokesperson for the NGO Germanwatch, told DW that such cases \"draw attention to the issue and show other people suffering from the negative impacts of climate change that they are not alone.\" But financial incentives are still a proven path to success, as seen most recently in a landmark case in Australia where a $41 billion pension fund was sued by a fund member for investing in fossil fuels, an increasingly risky venture. The case was settled in early November 2020, with the pension fund pledging to achieve a \"net zero carbon footprint for the fund by 2050.\" Analysts expect the case to spur similar litigation around the world. \"If investors are legally required to apply a climate risk lens to their portfolios, this could, for example, result in a significant reduction in investments in fossil fuels, many of which are already being viewed as stranded assets in a low-carbon future,\" said David Barnden, of the law firm that argued the case. The summer of 2019 saw heat records in Europe broken across the continent. In July, Germany recorded its highest temperature ever at 42.6 C (108 F). France broke its heat record twice in 2019, the highest temperature measuring 46.C (114.8 F) in July. Climate change increases the frequency of heat waves. In November 2019, the Italian archipelago city of Venice experienced multiple flooding events and the high water mark of 1.5 meters was reached three times in one week for the first time in recorded history. Projected sea level rise due to climate change could make these events more likely in the future. The same heat wave that brought record temperatures to France sparked the worst wildfires to hit Spain in 20 years. On the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, wildfires in August decimated a national park on the popular tourist island. Hotter temperatures and drier air due to climate change increase the risk of fires. A combination of drought, storms and extreme heat is depleting Germany's forests. According to BDF, a forest advocacy group, in Germany, more than 1 million established trees have died since 2018. \"These are no longer single unusual weather events. That is climate change,\" said a BDF representative. A glacier on the Italian side of Mont Blanc experienced accelerated melting in 2019. And enthusiasts held a \"funeral\" for the Pizol glacier in the Swiss Alps, which has almost completely disappeared. Scientists say climate change accelerates glacial melting in the Alps. Two consecutive years of drought in Germany have hit farmers hard. In 2018, record drought caused major crop failures, and heat waves in 2019 also damaged crops. \"Climate change means more frequent droughts and extreme weather events in Germany,\"said German Weather Service Vice President Paul Becker. \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "5 legal tactics environmentalists are using to fight climate change", "article_name": "5-legal-tactics-environmentalists-are-using-to-fight-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/5-legal-tactics-environmentalists-are-using-to-fight-climate-change/a-55593003", "date_published": "2020-11-16 00:00:00", "article_length": 10354, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:00:20.041424"}

Bread, croissants and cakes donated in Leipzig Read more:\u00a0\u00a0 Should there be a 'meat tax' to fight climate change? \"According to 2011 estimates, one-third of all food produced globally ends up in the garbage,\" says Rosa Rolle, head of the Food Loss and Food Waste Project at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). In total, that is 1.3 billion tons of food per year that goes uneaten. The FAO estimates that collectively this food waste has a CO2 footprint of 3.6 gigatons. These figures don't include the CO2 emissions produced when forests are cleared for animal farming or to create soybean or palm oil plantations. In other words, if food production were a country, it would be the third largest CO2 emitter in the world after the US and China. The 'haves' throw away a lot of food The majority of food waste is produced by the high-income industrialized countries. According to FAO estimates, Europeans on average throw away\u00a095 kilograms (209 lbs) of food annually per person. In the low-income African countries south of the Sahara, it is only 6 kilograms. Some food groups are more resource-intensive than others. Meat is by far the worst for the climate, partly because cattle and other ruminants generate large amounts of methane,\u00a0a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more harmful to the climate than CO2. In the case of cows that amounts to several hundred liters of gas every day. As a result, according to the environmental organization Greenpeace, roughly 13 kilograms of CO2 is released per kilogram of beef, compared to only 0.75 kilograms of CO2 for a typical loaf of brown bread. Food that ends up in landfill sites produces climate-damaging gases into the atmosphere Read more: Danish app saves food from trash can Meat that is thrown away is therefore far more\u00a0problematic for the environment than most\u00a0plant-based foods, all the more so because 20 percent of the world's meat\u00a0products end up in the bin. That's equivalent to 75 million cows a year, according to the FAO. Tackling the mountains of food waste \"Despite some progress and good initiatives for redistribution, too much food still ends up in landfills, releasing even more climate-damaging gases into the atmosphere,\" says Rolle. Regardless of whether it's bread or meat,\u00a0it continues to contribute to climate change, as organic waste rots in landfills and releases methane gas. \"In the EU, for example, this is still the case in the small island nation of Malta,\" says Stefanie Siebert from the European Compost Network (ECN), an association of European companies from the bio-waste industry. Although landfill methane gas can be captured and used to generate electricity, that can't happen until the landfill is closed. \"As long as waste is still being transported to the landfill, the climate-damaging gases escape unhindered into the atmosphere,\" she says. So what are the alternatives? Turning waste into a source for\u00a0clean electricity? \"First and foremost, we have to try to avoid food waste,\" said Siebert.\u00a0But ultimately, eco-friendly recycling of food waste needs to happen not only among individuals but at an industrial level. This can happen, for example, in biogas plants. Here, the gas produced by decomposing food waste can be used much more effectively than at the landfill. The facilities continuously generate electricity and heat, which, depending on the system, can also be fed into the grid. What remains is the fermentation product.\u00a0\"This remaining product from the biogas plants is fluid,\" says Siebert. Further composted with wood materials, it can be turned into\u00a0high quality compost. But so far, only 17 percent\u00a0of organic waste within the EU is composted or fermented.

{"id": null, "body": "     Environmental changes are posing a serious threat to production and nutritional value of our crops. Not taking action could have major global implications for food security and public health, a new study outlines. A new study has further revealed how climate change is reducing yields\u00a0and sucking the nutrients from our vegetables and legumes, raising serious questions over the future of food security and public health around the world. The study is apparently the first of its kind to methodically examine to what extent environmental changes such as water scarcity, increases in temperature and a greater concentration of carbon dioxide could impact the nutritional quality and yield of crops vital to our everyday nutrition. Read more: \u00a0 Sustainable food for everyone? The challenge of our century Previous research into the impact of environmental change on food has mostly focused on the yield of staple crops such as wheat, rice and corn. However, there has been comparatively little discussion on how climate change is affecting nutritious foods that are considered more important to\u00a0a healthy diet. Vegetables scorched by a heat wave in China \u2014 such events may become more common in the future due to climate change The 'junk food effect' The phenomenon of crops\u00a0being stripped of their\u00a0high nutritional qualities due to environmental factors has become known as the \"junk food effect.\"\u00a0 For some time now, researchers have been aware that many of our most important plant-based foods are becoming less nutritious. Studies have shown how the\u00a0 mineral, protein and vitamin content in fruits and vegetables has decreased over the past few decades , although until recently this had been explained away\u00a0by the fact that we had been prioritizing higher yields over nutrition.\u00a0 \"Vegetables and legumes are vital components of a healthy, balanced and sustainable diet, and nutritional guidelines consistently advise people to incorporate more vegetables and legumes into their diet,\" says lead author Pauline Scheelbeek. \"However, our new analysis suggests that this advice conflicts with the potential impacts of environmental changes that will decrease the availability of these crops.\" The carbon dioxide factor Alongside water scarcity and increasing temperatures, higher levels of carbon dioxide are being blamed for stripping crops of their nutritional value. But carbon dioxide is good for plants, so why should we be worried about rising CO2 levels?\u00a0While it's true that plants do require carbon dioxide in order to grow and thrive, it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Rising carbon dioxide levels ramp up the process of photosynthesis \u2014 which is what\u00a0allows plants to transform sunlight into food. While this certainly helps plants grow, it\u00a0has\u00a0the side effect of causing them to produce more simple carbohydrates such as glucose. And this comes at the expense of other important nutrients we need in order to stay healthy\u00a0including protein, zinc and iron. Food security a growing concern The latest findings, published in Nature , have alarming implications for food security and raise some disconcerting questions about the future of our planet's food supply. Hotter regions such as Southern Europe, Africa and South Asia are most at risk, where higher temperatures are already expected to reduce crop yields by about 31 percent. But Scheelbeek says the total crop yield is not necessarily the most important factor to consider. \"I think we have shifted from food intake being the biggest problem in terms of global food security to the issue of nutrition,\" she told DW. We currently grow far too many grains, say some experts Tim Benton, a visiting fellow at Chatham House and a specialist in food security and sustainability, agrees that the issue of food security \u2014 at least from a global perspective \u2014 needs to be looked at through the lens of public health and nutrition rather than focusing on the amount of crops that we grow. \"It's a developed world problem and a developing world problem,\" he told DW. Benton, who was not involved in the new study, doesn't see the world heading toward starvation due to not being able to\u00a0grow crops. \"But we are going to be in a situation where public health gets worse.\" Potential for a nutritional crisis The reduced nutritional quality of important crops could\u00a0mark the beginning of a looming health crisis. One of the biggest concerns addressed by the report is the potential increase of micronutrient deficiencies. Around 1.5 million deaths per year are already linked to low vegetable intake, according to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) \u00a0study. The worldwide per capita daily consumption of fruit and vegetables is already from 20 to 50 percent\u00a0below the minimum recommended levels. A paper published in Nature in 2014 highlighted how rising carbon dioxide levels are leading to lower nutrient concentrations \u00a0in\u00a0staple crops, like wheat and rice.\u00a0 But Benton stresses\u00a0that at this stage, we should be more worried about the non-staples. A\u00a0focus on cash crops is part of the problem, he added. \"We currently grow three times as much grain and about a third of the amount of fruit and\u00a0vegetables that we need,\" he told DW. A lack of veg? Benton says too much grains and not enough nutritious fruit and vegetables are cultivated worldwide Scheelbeek says various issues need to be considered if the consumption of legumes and vegetables drops as a result of environmental changes. \"For example, what would people eat instead? What would be their substitution for a less-available or more expensive legume on the market? It's certainly something we need to address.\" Adaptation key to\u00a0crisis Experts say the best way to alleviate the threat to crops in the future is to prioritize changes in agricultural production . Benton believes looking toward\u00a0growing new crop varieties is \"absolutely necessary\" if we wish to avoid a crisis. Read more: \u00a0 Gene editing: The key to food security in a warmer world? Scheelbeek says the results of the study represent a \"business-as-usual scenario,\" assuming very little action is taken over the next few decades. \"We hope of course that the [results] of this study are a bit of an eye-opener, and that this is a gap that we need to bridge to make sure that there is enough nutritious food until the end of the century.\" The challenge of feeding a planet that\u2019s set to have 3 billion more people on it by 2050 - made even more acute by climate change as some parts of the planet become wetter, while others drier - means the pressure is on to find ways to feed the planet. So farming has to become more productive \u2013 and new areas to grow, especially in dry climates, must be found. One potential solution: hydroponics. Farming with little space and producing higher crop yields: hydroponics fits the bill. Though it may sound like something out of Star Trek, it's actually been around since the Aztecs \u2013 they built floating farms around the city of Tenochtitlan. Hydroponics essentially means growing plants without soil, and instead using a nutrient-rich solution to supply them with water and minerals. With hydroponics, plants \u2013 usually supported by soil \u2013 are propped up artificially instead, and a nutrient solution is applied to the suspended roots using a number of different methods, including spraying them with a solution mist. Together with artificial lights, heaters and other equipment, the nutrient solutions help plants develop faster, produce larger yields and grow all year round. Hydroponics can recycle water, meaning it could use as little as 10 percent of the water a conventional farm uses \u2013 making it an option in arid environments. And the closed system means nutrients don't escape, cutting fertilizer down to as much as a quarter of what a conventional farm would use. Also, almost no pesticide is needed, since soil pests aren't an issue for plants grown without soil. When growing sideways isn't an option, try going upwards: hydroponic growing trays can be piled on top of one another, and plants can be grown more closely next to each than in the soil, making it very efficient in terms of space. As for what kind of space they can grow in, the sky is the limit: with no need for scarce farmland, one possibility could be to have hydroponic farms in skyscrapers. Running a hydroponic farm can be complex, energy-intensive and expensive. Plants require many essential nutrients, and the farm needs a large amount of equipment. Heat and light, supplied for free by the sun in conventional farms, have to be provided artifically and paid for. And power failures could mean whole crops are destroyed if they go too long without water and light. Hydroponics can theoretically be used to grow any crop, although the technique lends itself best to plants such as cucumbers, salad greens, tomatoes, peppers and herbs. Given its long history, hydroponics still isn't widely used. But that looks set to change: the global hydroponic farming industry was estimated to be worth $21.2 billion in 2016. That's forecast to grow by 7 per cent each year. Author: Melanie Hall Intensive modern agriculture still relies on wild birds, bees and beasts for pollination. But these species \u2014 and whole industrial supply chains that depend on them \u2014 are at risk, according to a new global survey.

{"id": null, "body": "     This summer flash floods and landslides in India left people bereaved and displaced. Activists say poor urban planning, driven by tourism and urban growth, is exacerbating the impact of the climate crisis. Reena Bhalekar stands in the location where her house was before the floods swept it away. All that remains is her bed At first, no one noticed the water lapping angrily at the riverbank.\u00a0 Reena Bhalekar's family slept soundly as the early morning rain drummed on the tarpaulin of their shelter. \"The water was rising\u00a0slowly,\"\u00a0the 26-year old remembers. \"My sister wasn't even aware that the water\u00a0had come into her home.\"\u00a0 Then, from somewhere nearby, a piercing scream shattered the silence. Rushing outside, Reena discovered the river had risen dramatically overnight and now reached their slum in Chetru, a tiny village on the outskirts of Dharamshala in the Indian Himalayas . Settlements further down the hill were already a foot deep in water. With the road leading out of the settlement submerged, the family abandoned their belongings and scrambled up the densely forested hill to safety. The path that the community used to escape after floodwaters cut off their escape out of the settlement The flash flood in July wreaked havoc across the district, damaging properties and triggering a deadly landslide. It was one of 35 witnessed by the state of Himachal Pradesh in the first six weeks of India's monsoon \u00a0season, a landslide incident increase of 116% compared to last year.\u00a0 Himalayan villages like Chetru are situated in a region known as the planet's \"third pole\"\u00a0due to its vast ice sheet, which holds the largest amount of frozen water outside of the polar caps. Scientists warn that that the area is likely to witness rapidly melting glaciers and increasingly erratic rainfall patterns over the coming century due to climate change.\u00a0 However, activists say disasters like that in Chetru point to more than just climate change. They highlight how the impacts of the climate crisis are being compounded by unbridled development, driven by tourism and rapid urban growth.\u00a0 Houses built along the riverbank in Chetru were severely damaged by the floodwaters \"In the popular discourse climate change is very easy to blame,\"\u00a0said Manshi Asher, an environmental activist and co-founder of local research collective Himdhara. This avoids addressing the issues of unplanned development, lack of regulation and rampant tourism, argues Asher.\u00a0 A 2015 study prepared for the state's own Disaster Management Cell cautioned against the risks of overdevelopment in Himachal Pradesh, finding the region at high risk of human-induced landslides as heavy construction and deforestation disturb the already fragile terrain.\u00a0 Reena's family and her neighbors experienced this first-hand. Not only did overdevelopment and the accompanying deforestation unsettle the local terrain, potentially intensifying the impact of the July floodwaters, it was also the reason they found themselves living there in the first place. The families migrated decades ago from a neighboring state to find daily wage labor and settled in Charan Khad, a suburb of Dharamshala. In 2016, their slum was deemed a sanitation hazard and demolished, leaving around 290 families without shelter.\u00a0 Tourism and rapid population growth have created demand\u00a0for building projects in the region However, Asher believes\u00a0that the land had become \"prime property\u201d and the community was displaced to make way for new construction as part of a central government urban development scheme known as the Smart City Mission , aimed at driving economic growth.\u00a0 \"There was suddenly this whole plan of developing botanical gardens, parking, all kinds of things in the city,\"\u00a0she says, adding there was no attempt to provide sanitation or legally recognize the slum, which would have entitled its residents to resettlement. Instead, the community was left to build flimsy tarpaulin structures beside a fast-flowing river \u2014\u00a0the only patch of land available to them. India's National Green Tribunal, which handles environmental issues, has strict laws on housing density and multi-story building construction, and in 2019 the Supreme Court imposed a complete ban on tree felling for development projects in forest areas of Himachal Pradesh. Despite this, illicit hill leveling and destruction of forest areas remain commonplace.\u00a0 McLeod Ganj, home to the Dalai Lama and Tibetan government-in-exile, is popular with pilgrims and tourists \"The law is very good in India on paper \u2014\u00a0the problem is with the enforcement of it,\"\u00a0says environmental lawyer Deven Khanna, appointed by the High Court of Shimla, the state capital, in 2018 to investigate environmental violations in the region. The number of structures in Dharamshala which are built in violation of building laws is, he says, \"mind boggling.\" Home to the Tibetan government-in-exile and a popular destination for pilgrims and foreign tourists, Dharamshala has experienced substantial urban growth in the last few decades, with the population more than doubling between 2011 and 2015. In Bhagsu, a village popular with tourists in Upper Dharamshala, illegal building extensions constructed by hotel owners over the top of a stream obstructed the high flow of water during the flash flood this summer. With nowhere to go, the water burst out onto the main street, washing away cars and causing substantial damage to shops and houses. The illegal encroachments were demolished on the orders of state officials in the days following.\u00a0 Locals in Bhagsu claim that constructions had been blocking the path of the stream for years before the disaster \"The problem is starker in a place like Dharamshala, because it is a tourist place and there is a lot of opportunity to earn money from land, from buildings,\"\u00a0Khanna explains. \"People are okay with the risks, because they are thinking about the money.\" Disillusioned with the inaction of local officials and the lack of resolution from the High Court case, Khanna now believes that long-term solutions lie with technology. He has advocated for the use of aerial drones and satellite mapping to monitor tree coverage and illegal felling.\u00a0 Floodwaters burst out from the stream running through Bhagsu village onto the road, causing widespread destruction On his advice, the High Court ordered trials that involved tagging trees with GPS monitors and using drones to map areas around the state capital Shimla. Despite some initial success however, the schemes have been discontinued, due to what Khanna sees as a lack of political will and pressure from the public.\u00a0\u00a0 Before the floods washed away their homes, Reena's community had been campaigning for years to be relocated to safer ground. They have now renewed their campaign for compensation and permanent resettlement. In the meantime, the government has provided temporary shelter nearby.\u00a0 For Reena, the memories of the flood still weigh heavily. \"I have nightmares where the water comes again at night and all of my children, the whole community, is swept away in the floods,\"\u00a0she says. \"No-one escapes.\" \n Mount Everest has turned into a dumping ground as the growing numbers of climbers leave their trash behind on the mountain.

{"id": null, "body": "     Germany's Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel addresses the UN Climate Change Conference Wednesday knowing Germany ranks fifth in a list of greenhouse gas emitting countries who do the most to fight global warming. Germany is a world leader in renewable energy The index ranks 56 countries that are part of the Kyoto Protocol or that contribute at least one per cent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The calculations by the Bonn-based environmental group Germanwatch took into account emissions levels, emissions trends and climate policy. Sweden, Britain and Denmark topped the rankings. But, Christoph Bals, the director of Germanwatch, said the current efforts by the top scorers are not enough to effectively curb and reverse global warming. Even Sweden is like a one-eyed king among the blind, he said. The United States -- the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases -- ranked at 53, with only China, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia doing worse. What happens after 2012? Sigmar Gabriel is in Nairobi for the Climate Change Conference The index's release came as the world's environment ministers gathered in the Kenyan capital Nairobi for the decisive phase of the UN Climate Change Conference. The ministers are under pressure to develop a framework to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. The German delegation at the conference, which finishes on Friday, is led by Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel. Germany 's emissions on the rise Before leaving for Nairobi, Gabriel said that based on preliminary data, Germany's carbon dioxide emissions actually rose in 2003 and 2004. He said this was due to increases in emissions from power plants and industry, even though they had promised to cut those emissions. \"That means we will have to tighten the screws even further,\" Gabriel said. WWF says Germany's Frimmersdorf coal-fired power plant is the second worst climate polluter in Europe. Under the Kyoto Protocol, Germany is committed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012. Much of Germany's initial advances toward the target are due to the collapse of former East Germany's heavily polluting industry. \"We'll have to take tougher measures,\" Gabriel said. \"Despite their requirements to cut CO2 emissions, power plants and the industry actually increased those. Evidently, they exported more power or older power plants were used.\" \"If we don't reach our targets, then it will be difficult to convince the developing and newly industrialized countries to agree to a post-Kyoto protocol,\" he said. Gabriel also stressed the need to help developing countries adapt to climate change because they weren't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions causing the problems. The situation in Africa \"is dramatic\", he said. US wakes up to climate change But Gabriel said he saw welcome signals from the United States, even before last week's elections where the Democrats gained control of both houses. Californian Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger introduced the first US cap on greenhouse gases \"The political climate in the United States on climate change has improved,\" he said. \"It's interesting that a Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, bucked the trend and won. Others are now saying 'We have to do more'.\" The US, which produces around a quarter of the world's greenhouse gases, has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol. The treaty obliges 39 of the world's most industrialized countries, which emit the lion's share of greenhouse gases, to cut emissions to combat global warming. On the heels of a major study that says world leaders must act urgently to avert a looming environmental catastrophe, Germany's environment minister has called on the country to invest heavily in green technology.

They are now joined by over 2,800 more signatories in urging the\u00a0protection of life on Earth.\u00a0 Since the 2019 declaration, Earth has seen an \"unprecedented surge\" in climate-related disasters, researchers noted.\u00a0 A wildfire that burned through at least 7,780 hectares (30 square miles) in about a week and devastated forests in southern Spain was brought under control thanks to steady rains. The downpour helped the firefighters, who were backed by some 50 aircrafts. The blaze was one of the most difficult to combat in recent times in Spain. Some 2,600 people were forced to flee their homes. Unprecedented flooding \u2014 caused by two months' worth of rainfall in two days \u2014 has resulted in devastating damage in central Europe, leaving at least 226 people dead in Germany and Belgium. Narrow valley streams swelled into raging floods in the space of hours, wiping out centuries-old communities.

While half of Europe is drowning, elsewhere areas are going up in flames: Large fires raged, particularly in Greece, Italy and Turkey. They have caused unforeseeable monetary damage, while thousands of people in Europe have lost their homes and their belongings. In addition to deadly wildfires, Italy also battled record heat temperatures, with the Italian Health Ministry issuing the maximum possible heat warning level for many cities. On the island of Sicily, 48.8 degrees Celsius (almost 120 degrees Fahrenheit) was measured on August 11 \u2014 a new European heat record. The heat could make existing fires worse, or lead to new ones. Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire continues smoldering in California. It's California's largest fire on record, and among the most destructive in the state's history \u2014 it wiped the town of Greenville off the map. Although it's about 60% contained, the fire continues to burn two months in. Meanwhile, hot and dry conditions continue in the region, spreading fears of more fire. Earlier this summer, record floods also hit parts of India and central China, overwhelming dams and drains and flooding streets. The downpours have been particularly heavy, even for the rainy season. Scientists have predicted that climate change will lead to more frequent and intense rainfall \u2014 warmer air holds more water, creating more rain. As nations flood in northern Europe, Mediterranean countries like Greece were in the grip of several heat waves. In the first week of July, temperatures soared to 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit). Tourism hot spots like the Acropolis were forced to shut during the day, while the extreme heat also sparked forest fires outside Thessaloniki, which helicopters tried to douse. \"It is an unprecedented reality in Sardinia\u2019s history,\" said Sardinia's Governor Christian Salinas of the ongoing wildfires that have scorched the historic central western area of Montiferru. \"So far, 20,000 hectares of forest that represent centuries of environmental history of our island have gone up in ashes.\" Around 1,500 people were evacuated from the island by the end of July. Intense heat is becoming more common, as seen in late June in the US states of Washington and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Scorching temperatures under a \"heat dome,\" hot air trapped for days by high pressure fronts, caused hundreds of heat-related deaths. The village of Lytton recorded a high of 49.6 Celsius (121 Fahrenheit) \u2014 and burned to the ground the next day. Heat and drought are fueling one of the most intense wildfire seasons in the West Coast and Pacific Northwest regions. Oregon's Bootleg Fire, which burned an area the size of Los Angeles in just two weeks, was so big it created its own weather and sent smoke all the way to New York City. A recent study said the weather conditions would have been \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. To the south, central Brazil is suffering its worst drought 100 years, increasing the risk of fires and further deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Researchers recently reported that a large swath of the southeastern Amazon has flipped from absorbing to emitting planet-warming CO2 emissions, pushing the rainforest closer to a \"tipping point.\" After years of unrelenting drought, more than 1.14 million people in Madagascar are food-insecure, with some now forced to eat raw cactus, wild leaves and roots, and locusts in famine-like conditions. With the absence of natural disaster, crop failure or political conflict, the dire situation in the African nation is said to be first famine in modern history caused solely by climate change. The number of people fleeing conflict and natural disasters hit a 10-year high in 2020, with a record 55 million people relocating within their own country. That's in addition to some 26 million people who fled across borders. A joint report released by refugee monitors in May found that three-quarters of the internally displaced were victims of extreme weather \u2014 and that number is likely to grow. Author: Martin Kuebler, Stuart Braun, Sarah Klein, Anne-Sophie Br\u00e4ndlin For the study, researchers relied on \"vital signs\" to measure planetary health, including greenhouse gas emissions, glacier thickness, sea-ice extent and deforestation. Out of 31 signs, scientists found that 18 hit record highs or lows.\u00a0 The year 2020 was the second-hottest year since records began, scientists said. And earlier this year, the carbon dioxide concentration in the Earth's atmosphere was higher than at any time since measurements began. The authors noted that all-time low levels of ice mass have been recorded in Greenland and Antarctica. Glaciers are melting 31% faster than they did just 15 years ago, they added.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the annual loss rate of the Brazilian Amazon reached a 12-year high in 2020.\u00a0 Tim Lenton, director of the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute and co-author of the study, said the recent record-breaking heat wave in the western United States and Canada showed that the climate had already begun to \"behave in shocking, unexpected ways.\" \"We need to respond to the evidence that we are hitting climate tipping points with equally urgent action to decarbonize the global economy and start restoring instead of destroying nature,\" he said.\u00a0 Researchers reiterated calls for transformative change, listing three main emergency responses in the immediate term:\u00a0 Climate change should\u00a0be included in core curricula in schools worldwide to raise awareness, the authors said.\u00a0 Scientists also urged slashing pollutants, stabilizing the human population\u00a0and switching to plant-based diets.\u00a0 \"We need to stop treating the climate emergency as a standalone issue \u2014 global heating is not the sole symptom of our stressed Earth system,\" said William Ripple, a lead author of the study and professor of ecology at Oregon State University's College of Forestry. \"Policies to combat the climate crisis or any other symptoms should address their root cause: human overexploitation of the planet.\"\u00a0 \n    \nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent(\n'promio-pym-container',\n'https://system.promio-connect.com/register/16401/default/en/newsletter-form',\n{}\n);\n  fb/nm (AFP, dpa)\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate tipping points are now imminent, scientists warn", "article_name": "climate-tipping-points-are-now-imminent-scientists-warn", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-tipping-points-are-now-imminent-scientists-warn/a-58665256", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 8174, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:00:24.611570"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Killer heat due to global warming means much of the planet faces rising fatalities, a study shows. By 2100, almost half of people on the planet will be at risk of heat-related illness or death - even if emissions fall. As large swathes of the southwestern United States currently swelter\u00a0in blistering temperatures, scientists are warning in a new study that thanks to climate change,\u00a0heat waves like these will\u00a0only get worse - putting more lives at risk. With the mercury hitting 47 degrees Celsius\u00a0(118 degrees Fahrenheit) in Phoenix, Arizona, on Monday,\u00a0Camilo Mora of the University of Hawaii\u00a0said that in the future, \"the United States is going to be an oven.\" Climate change will sharply increase the frequency of lethal heat waves across the world, according to the\u00a0 study published this week in the journal \"Nature Climate Change.\" Currently, nearly a third of the planet's population is already exposed to deadly temperatures. The risk of falling ill or even dying from extreme heat is set to surge such that by the end of this century, it's estimated almost half of people across the globe will suffer periods of dangerous heat - even if emissions are drastically reduced. By 2100, the proportion of people at risk worldwide will grow to 48 percent in a scenario where greenhouse gases fall significantly. If emissions aren't curbed, the proportion of the global population under threat will soar to around three-quarters. The overall risk of heat-related illness or death has climbed steadily since 1980, with nearly one in three people globally now experiencing 20 days a year when the heat reaches deadly levels. \"We found that killer heat waves around the world are becoming more common - and that this trend already seems unavoidable,\" said Mora, lead author of the study. \"The empirical data suggest it's getting much worse.\" Keeping cool under a fountain in New Delhi, India - a country set to be among those hardest hit by rising heatwaves Little warming needed for tropics to turn 'deadly' The study analyzed 1,949 lethal heat waves from around the world since 1980, with heat and humidity during such deadly episodes enabling researchers to calculate the point at which conditions can become fatal. The team created computer simulations to determine how much more frequent heat waves will become under different carbon dioxide pollution scenarios. It showed that in the future,\u00a0the tropics will be hit hardest - regions including Sri Lanka and southern India, most of West Africa, and northern Australia will face more than 300 potentially lethal heat wave days each year under the planet's current business-as-usual emissions trajectory. According to Mora, \"with high temperatures and humidity, it takes very little warming for conditions to turn deadly in the tropics.\" Licking an ice slab at Pakistan's Karachi Zoo during a heatwave in April 2017 - animals are also set to suffer under extreme heat Like sunburn 'but inside the body' Mora said the threshold for\u00a0deadly conditions varies from place to place, with some people dying in temperatures as low as 23 degrees Celsius. Humidity levels combining with the heat is the crucial factor, explained Mora, as high humidity reduces the human body's ability to cool via perspiration. \"When it is both very hot and humid outside, heat in the body cannot be expelled,\" he said. \"This creates a condition called 'heat citotoxicity,' that is damaging to many organs. \"Think of it as a sunburn, but inside the body.\" Since the start of the 21st century, heat waves have claimed tens of thousands of lives, even in countries best equipped to help their citizens cope. The blistering heatwave that struck Europe in the summer of 2003 killed as many as 70,000 people. Higher temperatures and dry conditions have been made worse in urban areas by clearing trees, which provide shade and cooling moisture . After applying mud on their bodies, people cool off on a hot day on the banks of the Kanchon Mala lake in India Protection from the heat - for those who can afford it But a hotter world doesn't necessarily mean more deaths everywhere across the globe, Mora pointed out. He found that over time, the same sweltering conditions of heat and humidity killed fewer people than in the past - mostly because of air conditioning and governments doing a better job keeping people from dying in the heat. So the number of \"lethal heat days\" cannot predict how many people will die, said the study; if everyone is living in air-conditioned environments in the future, they will be shielded. However, that's only in countries that can afford it - in those that can't, heat will become even more unbearable in the future . Western countries can better endure the heat thanks to infrastructure including air conditioning Professor Dave Reay, chair in carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, told DW: \"As we bask in the early summer sun here in Europe, it's easy to forget the sinister side of the hotter summers that result from climate change. \"Responses such as provision of air conditioning, altered working hours and regular checks on elderly neighbors can all be very effective in reducing the short-term risks,\" he said. \"For the longer term though, it is how fast we can cut our greenhouse gas emissions that will ultimately decide how hot things get.\" Simon Bullock, a senior campaigner on climate change at Friends of the Earth, told DW that world leaders \"must put far more effort - far faster - into keeping coal, oil and gas in the ground.\" \"Burning fossil fuels is the main driver of the heat waves, droughts and floods [that are] putting people's lives in jeopardy.\" Large parts of central and northern India were sweltering on Saturday as temperatures hovered between 36 and 44 degrees C (96.8 and 111.2 F), even though peak summer is more than a month away. The Indian Meteorological Department said there were \"heat-wave to severe heat-wave conditions.\" The department had earlier warned that summer temperatures in 2017 were likely to be higher than normal. A district in India\u2019s second most populous state, Maharashtra, recorded an unusually high temperature of 46.5 degrees C (114.8 F) on Wednesday. A day earlier, Bhira Town also recorded temperatures in excess of 46 degrees. Meanwhile, heat-wave warnings were also issued for Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Maharashtra, south UP, south Haryana, Chandigarh and interior Odisha. Meanhwile, in neighboring Pakistan, temperatures in excess of 43 degrees C have engulfed parts of the southern province of Sindh. The cities of Nawab Shah and Larkana were the most affected, while several others, such as Mohenjo-Daro, Sukkur, Dadu & Hyderabad, also recorded temperatures above 40 degrees C. Earlier this week, health authorities in Pakistan\u2019s most populous city, Karachi, issued a heat-wave alert. The city administration is seeking cooperation from private hospitals to bolster preparations. Heatstroke relief centers are being established in all major public and private hospitals. Authorities have warned that the situation this year will be similar to the one in 2015. Currently, Pakistan ranks seventh in the list of 10 countries most affected by climate change globally, with 133 events directly attributed to it in the last two decades. They cost the country 3.82 billion dollars in losses incurred. A recently published report of the US National Academy of Sciences said there would be deadly heat waves, especially in megacities, even if global warming was limited to below 2 degrees C - the target set under the Paris climate agreement. The study's findings show that places like Karachi in Pakistan and Kolkata in India could expect conditions similar to the deadly 2015 heat waves. At least 2,000 people died in India during the heat wave in 2015, when temperatures hovered near 50 degrees C. In Pakistan, the death toll stood at 1,200, with some local estimates putting it at around 3,000. On one day, the temperature in Karachi rose to 48 degrees C. This was measured at around 64 degrees on the heat index, which tries to indicate how such a temperature is perceived by humans. Author: Aasim Saleem Worried by the United States leaving the Paris Agreement, countries are passing climate laws that will oblige future governments to act.

{"id": null, "body": "     More than 40 million people were driven from their homes by continued conflict and worsening weather in 2020 as the climate grew increasingly chaotic. Countries like Mozambique have been hit by armed insurgencies while still recovering from powerful cyclones Storms, floods, wildfires and droughts drove more than 30 million people from their homes last year, as rising temperatures wrought extra chaos on the climate , according to a report published Thursday by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC). Together with wars and violence, which forced 9.8 million people to flee within their borders, extreme weather brought the number of new internal displacements in 2020 to 40.5 million people, according to the IDMC. The Geneva-based research organization estimates a record-breaking 55 million people were living displaced within their own country by the end of the year. That's twice the number of refugees in the world. Conflict and climate change have pushed people into displacement camps Extreme weather is growing unnaturally strong as people burn fossil fuels and warp the climate. It is projected to drive more and more people from their homes through sudden shocks like floods and storms, as well as slower-burning crises like crop failures and drought. In rich countries, politicians have raised fears that more migration from poorer regions could overwhelm public services as the planet heats up. The idea that climate change will trigger mass migration towards rich countries is a \"distraction\" from the fact that most displacement is internal, said Bina Desai, head of programs at the IDMC. \"It's a moral obligation to really invest in supporting people where they are \u2014 rather than just thinking about the risk of them arriving at the borders.\" The annual report , in its sixth year, found more than 80% of the people forced from their homes in 2020 were in Asia and Africa. In Asia, most of the people forced to flee did so because of extreme weather. In countries like China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia \u2014 where hundreds of millions of people live on low-lying coastlines and deltas \u2014 a combination of population growth and urbanization has left more people exposed to floods that have grown stronger as sea levels have risen. The most severe cyclone to hit India in two decades made landfall on Monday, forcing authorities to evacuate 200,000 people in the state of Gujarat. But while early warning systems can save lives by pulling people out of harm's way, many of the displaced do not have a home to come back to. When Cyclone Amphan struck Bangladesh last year it forced 2.5 million people to flee and destroyed 55,500 homes, according to the report, suggesting that 10% of the people displaced were left homeless. Early warning systems can help save lives but do not protect homes In Africa, most displacements in 2020 were due to conflict. Persistent violence forced people from their homes in countries like Burkina Faso and Mozambique, while new wars sprang up in other countries like Ethiopia. The IDMC estimated half a million people had fled fighting in Ethiopia's Tigray region by the end of last year. Since then, UNICEF has put the figure above one million. Some conflicts were coupled with unusually long and heavy rainy seasons that brought floods and crop losses to countries already affected by violence. Heavy rains forced people already displaced once to flee again in countries like Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Niger, according to the report. Such environmental disasters triggered 4.3 million displacements in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020. At least half of them were still displaced by the end of the year. Migrants from rural areas to cities are often \"forced to settle in areas that are not safe for habitation and prone to flooding or other hazards,\" said Lisa Lim Ah Ken, a regional climate specialist at the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Kenya. \"A lot can be done, starting with prevention.\" Farmers across Africa have struggled to keep crops alive in the face of droughts, cyclones and locust swarms Schools have been turned into temporary shelters to house people displaced by conflicts like the violence in Tigray, Ethiopia Researchers say the links between climate and migration are poorly understood and sometimes overstated. While the IDMC compiles data on internal displacement \u2014 most of which comes from sudden disasters like floods and storms \u2014 there is little data on how many people leave homes because of slow-burning environmental crises like rising temperatures and sea levels. Still, a meta-analysis published in March by the University of Potsdam's Center for Economic Policy Analysis found that disasters that unfold over a long time like heatwaves and drought are more likely to increase migration than disasters that hit suddenly like floods and hurricanes. The researchers suggest this is because people need money to migrate, which is often lacking after sudden shocks, even though they cause immediate displacement across shorter distances. Those who stay put \u2014 often without insurance to rebuild houses or livelihoods \u2014 can be trapped \u00a0in a cycle of extreme weather that prevents them from leaving, though others may choose to stay behind for other reasons. \"If you want to migrate, then you need some resources to do so,\" said Barbora Sedova, an economist studying conflict and migration at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and co-author of the study. \"What is not so much talked about is the populations that are trapped at the origin and that actually lack the resources to migrate.\" Wildfires in rich countries like the US and Australia have also forced people to evacuate Climate change has already made extreme weather even more extreme \u2014 including in rich countries. A study published in the journal Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences in March found that the risk of intense fire during the 2019/2020 Australian wildfire season was made 30% more likely by human changes to the climate. The fires killed 34 people and destroyed thousands of homes. On Tuesday, a study published in the journal Nature Communications found that 13 percent of the $62.5 billion in damages when Hurricane Sandy struck New York City in 2012 was the result of sea-level rise. Had humans not heated the planet, and assuming all other factors stayed constant, the floods would have hit 70,000 fewer people, the modelers found. Climate migration researchers have called for governments to cut their greenhouse gas emissions swiftly, adapt to the changing climate and continue to support displaced communities once the immediate danger has passed. \"If we create opportunities for these people in cities \u2014 in terms of employment, housing, life and dignity \u2014 then migration does not necessarily have to become an issue of international security,\" said Sedova. \"If it's well managed, it can even have positive consequences for the country.\" The vast majority of the Earth's water is found in the ocean. But only a fragment of the planet's water \u2013 roughly 0.01% \u2013 flows through its rivers. And without these rivers, many other sources of surface water, like lakes and wetlands, would run dry. This is becoming a problem with climate change, and it's posing a threat to humans and animals alike in varied and, sometimes, unexpected ways. The dramatic effects of climate change aren\u2019t a recent phenomenon. Lake Chad, shown here in 1963, 1973, 1987 and 1997, has shrunk from roughly 25,000 km2 to under 2,000 km2 over the past 60 years. Long blamed on dams and irrigation, researchers have found that its water loss also comes from fluctuating temperatures which have negatively impacted its second most important river, the Komadugu Yobe. Lake Chad is a stark example of how climate change is forcing people to search for new sources of water and food. The region has seen a rise in tensions as farmers and cattle herders move towards richer land. But other continents just now feeling the pressure of climate change are starting to see their fish stocks unsuited to warmer waters \u2013 and their waters evaporating in the heat. Europe is one of these places. In the summer of 2018, the mighty Rhine River went from a powerful current to a gentle stream when temperatures soared past 30C (86F) and drought left the otherwise lush, rainy habitat too low to accommodate more than one lane of shipping. Other regions of the world are also coming to terms with what they once considered reliable water sources, like glaciers. Known as the world's water towers for their ability to reliably store large amounts of snow and ice, glaciers supply nearly 2 billion people with water. Experts fear the Himalayas, seen here, will lose a third of their volume by the end of the century. Farmers in the Indus River Basin, pictured above, are dependent on glacier melt from the Himalayas for crops like rice and cotton. They're part of a larger river basin in South Asia, which includes the Ganges and Brahmaptura Rivers. In total, these three waterways sustain roughly 129 million farmers and a total of 900 million residents with water. Unprecedented wildfires across the globe, as seen here in Australia, have been yet another side effect of climate change. The aftermath of the fires could prove toxic for Australia's most important watershed, the Murray-Darling water basin. Ash washed into the rivers that feed into the basin threaten to turn the water toxic for the 2.6 million Australians, not to mention many native species. It's not just ash and sediment from wildfires that can choke up the water. Heavier rainfall associated with extreme weather in the US, has been sweeping more runoff pollution from farms, for example, into the rivers, which then carry it to the open sea. Algal blooms like this one off of the coast of New York is one result. Another result is a dead zone, or an area deprived of oxygen by pollution. In fact, nitrogen pollution has also become a big problem for the Mississippi River, which runs through many US states. Besides a higher volume of nitrogen being washed into the water through flooding, increasingly powerful hurricanes connected to climate change are hurting the river's wetlands, which protect it from storm surges.

{"id": null, "body": "     Sea levels are now expected to rise even higher beyond the end of the century, putting coastal regions at extreme risk. Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner says the time for drawn-out discussions has passed \u2014 we need to act now. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has prepared a special report on climate change and its link with\u00a0oceans and the cryosphere in order to investigate how the most remote places on the planet would be influenced by climate change \u2014 and how this could in turn impact human societies on different continents.\u00a0DW spoke to Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner, a climatologist and Co-Chair of the IPCC's Working Group II, for a round-up of some of the report's most alarming findings and why we need to act sooner rather than later.\u00a0 DW: Why should people be concerned about the ocean and cryosphere in particular? Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner: We should all be concerned because the oceans are covering more than 70% of the planet and sea level rise concerns many coastlines, especially the low lying coasts and the low lying islands. The small island development states are among the most vulnerable places on the planet. If the cryosphere is melting, the sea level is rising and you feel that in the tropics. What better evidence can you mention for such teleconnections? So what are the main findings of the report? The projections of sea level rise over time in relation to the climate scenario have been updated. They will rise to even higher levels beyond the end of this century, essentially with some likelihood to reach several meters over time. And you can imagine what this means for coastal infrastructure, coastal defense, cities. It's not called the blue planet for nothing. The ocean covers up to 71% of the Earth's surface and 90% of the biosphere. It is integral to life and provides anywhere between 50 to 80% of the planet's oxygen, making it a vital part of the carbon cycle. The ocean's origins are still unknown, but it is thought to have formed 4.4 billion years ago, providing a catalyst for early life-forms. Despite its sheer size, we actually know very little about the ocean. In fact, over 80% of this underwater realm has yet to be mapped or explored. Scientists are working to unlock its mysteries, which could help us better understand environmental change and how to manage vital ocean resources in times of climate change. We do know that the ocean plays a major role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing solar radiation, distributing heat and driving weather patterns. But climate change is already starting to disrupt this balance, affecting the ocean's ability to perform key ecosystem tasks, such as carbon storage and oxygen generation. The ocean is home to at least 230,000 known species. Coral reefs on the sea floor provide a safe-haven for invertebrates like crabs, starfish and mollusks, as well as colorful reef fish. Plant life flourishes in the shallow depths, while bigger creatures like sharks, whales and dolphins roam the deep open waters. Unsurprisingly, scientists also think up to two-thirds of all ocean species may still be undiscovered. But researchers are finding new species every year \u2014 many of them unlike anything found before, such as this squidworm (pictured), discovered in the Celebes Sea in 2007. What else might be lurking down there is anyone's guess. But the ocean is under pressure. One of the most obvious examples being the increase of coral bleaching events in reefs around the world. Increased temperatures and pollution stress corals, causing them to expel a special kind of algae which allows them to grow and reproduce, leaving behind a ghostly skeleton. Some corals can recover, but prolonged stressors increase the chances of reef mortality. Climate change is also seriously impacting marine species, with recent research showing that local populations of fish, mollusks and crabs are disappearing at twice the rate of land species. Extreme temperatures are the main culprit, as the ocean offers fewer places to hide from the heat. Sadly, the majority of ocean species won't be able to evolve fast enough to adapt to the changing conditions. In the cryosphere \u2014 parts of the Earth's surface covered in solid water, including ice and snow \u2014 atmospheric warming is causing the melting of glaciers and ice. The current melting event is already contributing to global sea level rise and could also lead to higher levels of ocean acidification, thanks to methane released from seafloor permafrost in the Arctic Ocean. Humans are inextricably linked to the ocean. For thousands of years communities have thrived along the coast, relying on it for food and livelihoods. Today, more than one billion people live in low-lying coastal regions which are likely to be impacted by rising sea levels. But this connection has come at a cost. Just 13% of the world's oceans are completely free from human activities such as fishing, with almost no true wilderness left along coastal areas. Technological advancements mean even the farthest reaches of ocean in the Arctic are no longer untouched. Protecting the remaining wilderness will be a challenge for generations to come.  Author: Ineke Mules People will no longer possibly be able to maintain certain places under the influence of sea level rise. They may have to retreat, and all of this depends on decisions to be made by policy at this time and over the next few years [in terms of]\u00a0which scenarios to go for. And this special report in that way adds to the two other special reports that we have published in this assessment cycle starting with a special report on 1.5C degree global warming , and the special report on climate change and land which was published in August. So how does it complement those two reports? Building on the 1.5C degree report, there are millions of people affected more or less.\u00a0For example, between 1.5\u00a0and 2C degrees we saw a difference of sea level rise by end of century of 10 centimeters. But if you add on top of that the rising intensity of storms that is projected [as a result of]\u00a0climate change,\u00a0this means several million more people are affected\u00a0under less ambitious climate mitigation efforts. Read more:\u00a0 Psychology behind climate inaction: How to beat the 'doom barrier'\u00a0 So if we carry on as we are doing now are we going to have to abandon some of our coastal cities? Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner I would say that the projections are pointing in that direction. The report doesn't give the exact numbers, but it says the numbers will be higher than recently anticipated during the last assessment cycle, the AR 5 \u00a0[report from 2014]. They give stark warning to policy [makers] that this is something to be taken into account. And yes, there may be places that are no longer defendable, depending on how strong coastal defenses would have to be built in order to keep the water out. Are you making concrete recommendations to policymakers as to how they should be acting to mitigate further climate change and to help people adapt, especially the most vulnerable? The IPCC does not give recommendations. It talks about options and it talks about the effectiveness of some of those options, how they might help with the challenges that come with climate change. This not only concerns sea level rise. The report also talks about the changes in the ocean. It talks about the loss of coral reef ecosystems , re-confirming previous projections. It talks about the shift in fisheries stocks and the influence of climate change. The reduction in fisheries productivity depending on the degree of climate change so all of this adds to the picture that we\u00a0currently have\u00a0for the land sector.\u00a0It also strengthens the message that actually a good way forward for humankind would be to restore natural ecosystems.\u00a0Strengthening the current efforts internationally to set aside marine protected areas partly as buffer zones for fisheries but also to preserve biodiversity. The core message really is [that] there's no deviation from what we talked about in the 1.5C degree\u00a0report and in the land report. The remote places of the planet are connected to where we live and we would see those impacts\u00a0on top of those that we are causing in our own places where we currently live. Read more:\u00a0 Climate action: Can we change the climate from the grassroots up? The land report sparked\u00a0a major discussion about what we have to do to tackle climate change and secure the future. Politicians even appear finally to feel the need to act. How does the ocean and cryosphere report relate to that \u2014 do you expect this\u00a0report to have a similar effect? I would say yes. It complements our picture of the whole planet and how it responds to climate change. This concerns, for example, the role of cryosphere to provide fresh water to people. We see vanishing glaciers. This concerns some of the areas on the planet which depend mostly on the glaciers as a fresh water resource. This is another element where the cryosphere plays a role. Limiting the degree of sea level rise is an existential necessity for many coastlines including coastlines in Europe because we may otherwise lose places, lose large infrastructure.\u00a0 So, I mean,\u00a0what additional motivation do you need in addition to all the other information that was provided and the emissions scenarios discussed in the 1.5C degree report, which tells us that emissions reductions need to reach about 50% compared to 2010 by 2030 and then reach net zero by 2050.\u00a0 And we add to the rich information that we already have telling us it's time to act. And there is no time to wait. There's no time for extensive discussions, political discussions, we should have all the technologies available to us in place to help us mitigate climate change. And as we cannot reduce the climate to its original state, there is also the need to adapt and these options are\u00a0considered in the report. Are you optimistic that we can still get climate change under control? With all of the options that we've been discussing and seeing the current movement in society \u2014\u00a0 the mobilization of the young generation that is taking up this information in a very clear and convinced manner \u2014\u00a0I think building on this momentum I see a chance. Yes, policy is moving. They are feeling the pressure to act and many of them are also seeing the risks themselves. They're not just responding to voters' interests but may finally capture the existential threat that is coming out of climate change. As global warming speeds up, so does the rise in sea levels. While 2004 to 2010 saw oceans rise by about 15 millimeters in total, this value doubled for 2010 to 2016. Tropical regions in the western Pacific are especially affected, threatening many of the coastal areas and low-lying islands with submersion by the end of the century. As ocean and atmospheric temperatures increase, glaciers and ice caps shrink in size. In 2016, the global sea ice extent was 4 million square kilometers (1.54 million square miles) below average. Consequently, more meltwater flows into rivers and oceans, which also causes sea levels to rise. Some ocean regions have already warmed by more than 3 degrees Celsius, upsetting marine ecosystems. Seventy-two percent of demersal fish species in the northeast Atlantic Ocean have so far been affected, with warming limiting their abundance and spread. Species that live in tropical ocean waters, like the clownfish, are also experiencing habitat-related population decreases. Warming and acidifying waters affect Nemo's navigation senses, and also threaten his home - coral reefs, one of the most sensitive marine ecosystems. A water temperature increase of as much as 3 degrees Celsius can cause the death of corals and the marine animal species that live in them. Northern parts of Great Barrier Reef have seen coral mortality rates of 50 percent. With increased ocean heat, extremely strong tropical storms are set to occur much more frequently. One of these massive storms was Hurricane Matthew, which hit Haiti in October 2016. The Haitian government put the official death toll at 546, and the hurricane also caused $15 billion (13.8 billion euros) in economic losses on the island nation and in the US, Cuba and the Bahamas. There is a strong correlation between atmospheric wind patterns and ocean temperatures, meaning warming waters may also cause the jet stream to get stronger. This could affect airplane travel due to intensified head- and tailwinds. On the upside, this means that some flights may be much faster. On the downside, other flights may take longer and could experience more turbulence.

{"id": null, "body": "     As we grapple with climate change, travel journalist Paul Sullivan considers the cognitive and moral dissonance involved in selling destinations at a time when the planet needs us to be traveling less. It was while recently soaring 10,000 miles above Iceland's famously pulchritudinous interior, looking down through my airplane window at the gentle folds and pastel shades of its rhyolite mountains and the receding white snow atop its glaciers, that I found myself wondering: Is my job as a travel writer morally justifiable any more? Read more: \u00a0 Swedes switch to trains due to global warming I was on my way to update a guidebook and review some hotels for a newspaper. Excellent news for the local economy, of course, and certainly fun work if one can get it;\u00a0but reports underlining the devastating impact of tourism on the planet \u2014 the majority of which occur via air, car, rail and sea transportation, with the rest coming mainly from the hotel business \u2014 are by now impossible to ignore. Flying in itself makes up a large chunk of the overall percentage. Although a relatively small industry, aviation has a disproportionately large impact , accounting for between 3\u20137%,\u00a0depending on which reports you read,\u00a0of the total global amount of emissions. Yet the industry has no plans to slow down. Indeed, largely free of government regulation \u2014 it was given special status and excluded in the Kyoto and Paris climate change agreements \u2014 it is set to continue apace, with global passenger numbers expected to climb to 7.2 billion by 2035 ,\u00a0almost twice as many as in 2016 (3.8 billion). And while aircraft manufacturers\u00a0like Boeing are developing biofuels, there are no industry-wide solutions on the horizon right now. Of the 2 million-odd people who visit the Great Barrier Reef annually, a 2016 survey found that 69 percent were coming to see the UNESCO World Heritage site \"before it's too late.\" And no wonder. The IPCC says that even if we manage to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, 99 percent of the world's coral will be wiped out. Tourists can hasten their demise by touching or polluting reefs. And what's the carbon cost of flying to remote natural wonders under threat? A 2010 study found that the business of polar-bear safaris in Churchill, Canada, had an annual CO2 footprint of 20 megatons. Most visitors arrived by plane, and while 88 percent of them said humans were responsible for climate change, only 69 percent agreed that air travel was a contributing cause. Along with the polar bear, one of the most iconic images of climate change must be the dramatic curves of an iceberg sculpted by the warming atmosphere. Gliding between the melting giants on a cruise ship is a haunting experience that tourists will pay huge sums for. In the early 1990s just 5,000 people visited Antarctica each year, compared to over 46,000 in 2018. You don't have to go to the poles to see vanishing ice. Kilimanjaro's snowy peaks are a striking sight above the equatorial savannah of the national park, which generates \u20ac44 million ($50 million) from tourism annually. Many visitors climb to the Furtw\u00e4ngler Glacier \u2014 where 85 percent of the ice has vanished over the last century. The rest is unlikely to survive much beyond mid-century. When Montana's Glacier National Park opened in 1910, it boasted over 100 of the ice features from which it took its name. Now, there are fewer than two dozen. So dramatic is their retreat, that the park has become a center of climate science research. Some 3 million hikers and holidaymakers also visit the \"crown of the continent\" each year, soaking in the dying days of its ice-capped glory. The Maldives are the archetypal tourist paradise: 1,200 coral islands with white beaches rising just 2.5 meters above the turquoise waters. In 2017, the president decided to build new airports and megaresorts to accommodate seven times as many tourists, and use the revenue to build new islands and relocate communities. He has since been voted out of office and faces corruption charges. It's not just islands that are going under as sea levels rise. Wetlands like Florida's Everglades are disappearing too. Over the last century, around half the Everglades have been drained and turned over to agriculture. Now, saltwater is seeping into what's left, making it the only critically endangered World Heritage site in the United States. The Galapagos will be forever associated with Darwin, who realized their unique wildlife had evolved over countless generations in isolation. Today, they are besieged by visitors and environmental changes are happening too fast for species to adapt. Ocean warming has left iconic creatures like the marine iguana starving, while UNESCO lists tourism among the greatest threats to the archipelago.  Author: Ruby Russell Dangers of over-tourism In the meantime, major natural sights like the Great Barrier Reef, the Galapagos Islands and glaciers as far-flung as Iceland and Africa are disappearing before our eyes, 1 million plant and animal species are currently threatened directly by climate change , and cities like Venice , Amsterdam , Barcelona and Reykjavik are creaking under the strain of what has recently become known as \"over-tourism.\" While I was in Reykjavik, locals were complaining about businesses being wiped out to make way for generic souvenir shops, bland hotels and multinational restaurant chains.\u00a0Local nature was being damaged by overtourism, too. How to justify our travels in such a problematic context? One immediate response is to reduce personal carbon emissions. This is something many of us, including myself, have already been doing for a long time, including taking the train for most of my personal and professional travels wherever possible (and offsetting the handful of flights I have taken ). Yet it doesn't seem enough. Added to this is my role as the travel writer, which prompts rising levels of cognitive dissonance and moral guilt at being part of an industry that helps local economies, on the one hand, while effectively supporting environmental damage on the other. Again, an immediate response is to green wash articles; to write about trains and not planes , eco-hotels and \"woke\"\u00a0destinations. But for all the goodwill of the industry's efforts in that realm, the idea of eco-tourism and even \"slow travel\" already feel like a contradiction in terms. We need to\u00a0reduce travel The conclusion, as far as I can see, is that the travel industry desperately needs regulation, but we should also be prepared to take on some personal liability \u2014 let's perhaps call it \"ethical travel,\" as opposed to eco-travel. In the same spirit of the \"reducetarian\"\u00a0movements that have sprung up around consuming meat or using plastic, this would mean questioning first and foremost whether we actually really need to travel; hopefully concluding that we don't, at least some of the time; and only after that, considering how we travel. Read more: \u00a0 Could eco-friendly flying be on the horizon? In one sense, of course, certain travel choices are being taken away from us anyway. Tours and trips are increasingly being canceled or postponed because of a lack of snow or ice, or because places \u2014 including much of Europe this summer \u2014 are too hot, or too wet. Ironically, this situation has given rise to what is being called last-chance\u00a0tourism, ironic because the influx of tourists to precarious destinations serves to hasten their demise.\u00a0This is why UNESCO, for example, officially lists tourism among the greatest threats to the Galapagos archipelago. Planes powered with renewable energy don't produce CO2 or other climate-damaging emissions such as nitrogen oxide and particles. They are smaller, lighter and more efficient than planes powered by kerosene. The Alpha Electro from the Slovenian start-up Pipistrel is already proving this since 2015, when it had its maiden flight. Most companies and scientists see the future of electric planes in regional transport. The Israeli start-up Eviation plans to revolutionize commuting with their nine-seater. The prototype Alice can fly for up to 650 miles (1,000 kilometers), and will take to the sky in 2019 for the first time, according to the company. The flying taxi of the German company Lilium had its first successful flight in April 2017. The five-seater can take off and land vertically, has a reach of 190 miles and travels from London to Paris in just an hour. The goal of the company is for people to one day be able to order their flying cab via app for the price of a regular taxi ride. Some plane manufacturers don't dare go all-electric just yet. In November 2017, Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Siemens announced they will jointly develop a commercial hybrid-electric prototype. The e-Fan X will be powered by three gas turbines and one electric motor. The companies aim to replace a second gas turbine with another electric motor at a later stage. A prototype is anticipated to fly in 2020. As part of British budget airliner EasyJet's plans to become more climate-friendly, it has entered into a cooperation with the United States startup Wright Electric. The goal is to develop a completely electric-powered plane for up to 150 passengers. It's not known yet when we can expect to see a first prototype. Experts believe that we could be flying in electric planes within 20 years. Various prototypes companies are working on have a range of a 155 to 650 miles. But technology is developing at an ever-faster pace. Who knows? One day, we might be able to travel around the world in emission-free planes completely powered by renewable energy. There's hope for all environmentally conscious travel addicts! Author: Katharina Wecker It seems obvious to me that we need to urgently reduce travel. Of course that means economies will suffer, and jobs (including mine), will be lost. And for these reasons, as well as wanting to continue traveling myself, I still hope that things don't get so extreme that we have to stop altogether; that we can find at least some compromises, perhaps in the shape of biofuels or other technological innovations, along the way toward\u00a0an obvious endgame of planetary stewardship. If not, and thinking more positively, staycations can restore us to our own landscapes and communities \u2014 maybe not a bad thing in an era of political polarization. Perhaps they might even combat the anomie that is the dark side of globalization's utopian promises of ultimate connectivity. Maybe a break from travel could even enable us to appreciate it as a more authentic experience again. In the end, I suppose I believe it's better to make proactive sacrifices sooner, rather than have them forced upon us later,\u00a0and that people and economies can bounce back in a way that a devastated planet cannot.

{"id": null, "body": "     A group of mountain researchers hiked the length of the Alps this summer, retracing a similar trek 25 years ago. Much has changed since then, especially when it comes to the environment. Scientists hiking the length of the Alps this summer say the region has been marked by significant environmental and social changes since they first walked the same path, from Vienna to Nice, 25 years ago. Much of what they found\u00a0was alarming. At lower elevations,\u00a0 forests are drying out and tree-killing beetles are spreading. Orchards have been damaged by extreme spring weather, as severe cold snaps follow early warmups. Among the summits, some glaciers have retreated out of view and the permafrost that holds the rocky crags together is thawing. Extreme rain storms have become more frequent, triggering ever-larger landslides that are reshaping mountainsides\u2014so much that the path of the hike had to be altered in some places. Some historic trails have crumbled away and the melting alpine glaciers this summer have disgorged several bodies of climbers who vanished decades ago. \"These are all signs of climate change,\" says Swiss Geographer Harry Spiess, one of the four mountain scientists and one of the Whatsalp hike organizers. \"Everybody is aware of this, but nobody changes attitude in terms of mitigation,\" he says. \"Times have changed. In policy and politics, the focus has shifted to global issues like terrorism and migration.\" In Austria's D\u00fcrrenstein Wilderness, near the route of the Whatsalp trek, forester and wildlife biologist Stefan Sch\u00f6rghuber (center, with stick) explains the ecological benefits of wilderness to a group of private forest owners and farmers from the region Hikers and refugees Since controls on migration were tightened in the Balkan region last year, the Alps have become a primary pathway for refugees from Africa and the Middle East on their way to northern Europe. Encountering refugees on an alpine hiking trail would have been unheard of 25 years ago; today it's more than likely on some of the trails in the French-Italian frontier region. Nobody anticipated that scale of migration 25 years ago, and it is now a bigger concern for many people than environmental preservation or climate change, said Spiess, speaking with DW from Brian\u00e7on, one of only a few alpine towns that have made an effort to directly face the global demographic tremors of migration. Mass tourism In the global age, the ramparts of the Alps no longer isolate the region. During the last hike 25 years ago, nobody foresaw the economic boom in Asia, which has completely transformed tourism in the Alps. Mass tourism has been on the rise, leading to more highways, large hotels and parking lots\u2014all indications that the region has yet to embrace a more sustainable strategy for the future. \"It's not strong enough to destroy the Alps yet, but there's a long way to go to fully realize the region's sustainable development goals,\" says Spiess. Protecting rivers in the Alps can be part of a regional adaptation strategy to make ecosystems and communities more resilient to climate change Tourism development in certain alpine valleys has sprawled beyond the land's carrying capacity. In some regions, expected climate change impacts will threaten the very existence of communities. Climate models project the southern mountains will see more drought and heatwaves, but also more extreme rain and snowfalls. The northern foothills will rarely see snow in the future, and will be vulnerable to flooding from more powerful Atlantic storms. Signs of hope? Dominik Siegrist, a Swiss landscape planner and geographer who was also part of the 1992\u00a0hike, says this summer's three-month trek shows how the diversity of the alpine region, and a flowering of grassroots community advocacy groups, are keys to the future. Local activism and civic engagement have grown dramatically since the original hike. \"A big scene, a big community of alpine people is working on these challenges,\" says Siegrist, speaking to DW from the Rifugio W. Jervis, a mountain shelter on the border of Italy and France. Biologist Dr Andreas Boehner describes how global warming can change soil moisture in alpine pastures, thus shifting the composition of plants The efforts include scientific research, projects to promote sustainable agriculture and tourism and many new local, regional and international initiatives to expand and add conservation areas like parks. Also, activist groups are working across national borders to fight intrusive projects like a proposed highway link between Munich and Venice, as well as the expansion of ski areas into new, ever-higher terrains. Siegrist hopes the Whatsalp hike will help inspire more people to join those efforts, through a focused youth outreach effort as well as a presence on social media, a near-daily blog and widespread media coverage in German language media. Grassroots preservation The hike itself is a grassroots project. It's partly crowdfunded and there's an open invitation to join the group at any point along the way, including on the last few legs through Italy and France, as well as during the September 29 festivities at the finish in Nice, France. Along the way, the team met with local groups on more than 110 occasions. Whatsalp hikers passed by high alpine pastures that sustainably produce local food One such group was a network of mountain-climbing villages in Austria called \"Bergsteigerd\u00f6rfer,\" which promotes sustainable, low-impact and non-motorized recreation and tourism. There has also been an increase of agriculture-related tourism and organic farming and cattle-grazing on mountain pastures, which helps preserve cultural and environmental landscapes and benefits local economies, says Siegrist. Until Europe and the whole world move in a more sustainable direction, he expects the region will continue to face the same environmental and economic pressures that have persisted over the past 25 years\u2014pressures that will only be aggravated by climate change. Every year, tens of thousands of cranes stop over on the Baltic coast to prepare for their long flight to southern Europe. Tourists flock here too - to witness this impressive sight. By early autumn the first beech leaves have turned yellow in the Jasmund national park. One highlight is the view from the chalk cliffs made famous in the 19th century by German artist Caspar David Friedrich. The cliffs line the coast for 15 kilometers (9 miles) on the island in the Baltic Sea. The crowds of tourists have left the North Sea island by the autumn. This is a great time of year to enjoy a quiet stroll along one of the island's many beaches. Take a stroll through the palace gardens of Sanssouci and you\u2019ll see gardeners busy preparing for the winter season. By the way, Prussian King Friedrich II only used the palace in summer because it had no heating. The Kellerwald-Edersee national park beckons visitors in the fall with its many golden beech leaves. The park near Kassel has been a UNESCO world heritage site since 2011, together with four other beechwood regions. The Elbsandstein mountains near Dresden remain popular with climbers and hikers in the autumn. They rise steeply with bizarre rock formations on both sides of the River Elbe. The Feldberg mountain looms above the fog and the low-lying clouds in the Taunus region in autumn. It can be reached from Frankfurt by public transport in just 40 minutes. It is popular for hiking excursions with both locals and visitors alike. This is one of Germany's sunniest regions and home to some fine Burgundy wines. A popular tourist destination is the monastery vineyard and the famous baroque church in Birnau. It attracts around half a million visitors every year. Autumn in Bavaria isn't just Oktoberfest in Munich. It is the perfect time of year for hiking in the Alpine foothills. The lakes and forests south of Munich are another great destination, as are the moorlands. There are countless different places to visit in Germany in autumn and you'll get some great photos, for example in Bayreuth's park.

{"id": null, "body": "     A recent report says the Arctic may be ice-free by 2040. The Antarctic is also melting, albeit far slower, and in a less regular pattern. Why do the two poles react so differently in the face of climate change? First, the bad news: The Arctic is melting much faster than expected, and could even be ice-free in summer by the late 2030s, a report from the Arctic Council's Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program suggests. Previous studies had forecast an ice-free North Pole in summer by mid-century. While the outlook is bleak for the Arctic, there is a silver lining for the Antarctic: The ice is melting at a slower rate than previously thought. Although glacier flow has increased since the 1990s,\u00a0scientists from University of Leeds have found the melting rate\u00a0to be only around a third of what was previously projected. Operation IceBridge studies the processes that link the polar regions with the Earth's climate system. Rapidly changing polar ice means researchers need to use highly sophisticated airborne technology to measure annual changes in thickness and movement - onboard a retrofitted 1966 Lockheed P-3 aircraft. It's all part of a six-year project under NASA's Cryosphere Program, in which researchers are carrying out a series of eight-hour flights over Greenland (from March to May) and Antarctica (October to November) in order to accurately model a three-dimensional view of ice sheets, ice shelves and sea ice. In 2003, NASA launched a satellite called ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite) for the purpose of monitoring changes in polar ice. However, it suddenly stopped collecting data in 2009. With ICESat-II not expected to be ready for launch until 2018, researchers needed to somehow bridge the nine-year data gap between the two satellites. Enter operation IceBridge, which has been keeping a close eye on the polar ice - as well as its cute inhabitants - while ICESat-II is prepped for launch next year. Or is the hare rather watching over these strange bipeds? The data collected during these missions is critical for researchers in predicting the effects climate change is already having on the polar ice, including a rise in sea levels. According to NASA scientists, on March 7, 2017, sea ice in the Arctic reached the lowest maximum wintertime extent ever recorded. A glacier is visible through mist above Ellesmere Island. Operation IceBridge allows scientists gather valuable data by using special ice-penetrating radar, which only functions properly when used in lower altitudes. Scientists have long warned that the Arctic Circle will be one of the regions hit hardest by climate change - and effects are already becoming evident. The darker the color, the thinner the ice. Once ICESat-II is up and running, it will have the ability to take continuous measurements over a much wider area - unlike the current aircraft-based method, which is limited only to annual surveys. Icebergs are locked in sea ice, as seen from the research aircraft along the Upper Baffin Bay coast above Greenland. Aircraft-based research allows its human pilots to focus on specific areas of scientific interest, rather than simply conducting a flyover on a fixed path. As in Greenland, the ice fields of Ellesmere Island in Canada are also gradually retreating due to warming temperatures. The future of ICESat-II is now in question, as US President Donald Trump has pledged to strip funding for NASA's entire earth science program. Author: Ineke Mules, Stumai George But the Antarctic is still melting. And a rapidly advancing crack in its fourth-largest ice shelf could soon see one of the largest icebergs ever recorded in human history break off into the sea. Scientists agree that global warming causes both the ice in the North and the South Pole to melt. Air temperatures are climbing, and so are water temperatures. This makes the ice melt\u00a0faster. The period of winter where the water is actually cold enough to freeze is getting shorter, which means ice floes are getting smaller. The Arctic and Antarctic are far from \"polar opposites\" in the sense that ice at\u00a0both is melting away in the face of climate change. But why are the Arctic and Antarctic melting at such a different pace? Same\u00a0same but different Because the Arctic and Antarctic are cold, remote, and full of ice, they are often thought of as nearly the same. However, they\u00a0are in fact quite different. The first and most visible difference are the animals that call the frosty lands their home. Each polar extreme has a unique biome with many species that only survive there. Polar bears live in the Arctic and penguins only in the Antarctic , for example. Polar bears depend on sea ice and may go extinct in the wild if the ice disappears The second striking contrast is geography. The Arctic is a semi-enclosed ocean and almost completely surrounded by land. This means there is not much space for ice to float around. As a result, ice floes frequently bump into each other and pile up into thick ridges. Arctic ice is thicker, and stays frozen longer during summer. In winter, the sea ice covers up to 15 million square kilometers (6 million square miles), and 7 million square kilometers remain at the end of the summer melt season. The Antarctic is almost the geographic opposite of the Arctic - not just because it's on the other side of the world. The Antarctic consists of land surrounded by an ocean. The sea ice is free to move, and often floats northward\u00a0into warmer waters where it eventually melts during the southern hemisphere's summer months. In the Antarctic, almost all of the sea ice that forms during winter melts during summer. In the colder months, up to 18 million square kilometers (7 million square miles) of ocean is covered by sea ice, but by the end of the summer, only about 3 million square kilometers of sea ice remains. Losses and gains Growth and thaw of the ice is part of the annual cycle, and small fluctuations in the level of sea ice are normal. But scientists have observed a constant loss of sea ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic since the early 1970s. This is due to global warming. Since the Arctic is an ocean and consists mostly of sea ice, it has been affected more by rising ocean temperatures than the Antarctic, which consists mostly of ice-covered land. While the Antarctic has also lost sea ice, scientists discovered that ice is growing in other places. As glaciers in West Antarctica have melted, heavy snowfall in East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica led to an increase in ice sheets. Although it seems counterintuitive, accumulation of snow in the Antarctic is in fact a sign of global warming. The warmer the temperatures are, the more moisture is in the air. And the more moisture there is, the more snow falls. The Antarctic seems to be growing and melting at the same time. But overall, is it expanding or shrinking? This is the part that scientists don't agree about. According to data by the NASA, gains in ice have outweighed the losses from thinning glaciers from 1992 to 2008. Recent research by the University of Bristol, however, contradicts NASA's findings. The scientists claim in a study published early May that the gains in ice were three times smaller than suggested , and that the \"Antarctica, as a whole, has been contributing to sea level rise.\" Why do scientists find conflicting data? This is due to differing methodologies, as well as a general lack of data. Researchers started observing the Antarctic via satellite images in the late 1970s. That's not enough time to understand a complex system like the Antarctic, says Ted Scambos, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a research institute affiliated with the University of Colorado. \"The Antarctic system is highly variable. It's easily pushed around by changes of ocean temperatures and changes in the wind pattern,\" Scambos told DW. \"Trends are not easily detected; we need a lot more time for that.\" The Antarctic was long regarded to be immune to global warming. But Scambos believes that the response of the planet's southernmost continent is just slower than that of the Arctic. While it might be too early to see a trend, recent headlines are worrying. Levels of sea ice is fluctuating strongly at both the Arctic and the Antarctic. In February, sea ice was at a record low both in the Arctic and Antarctic . Penguins \u2013 a favorite animal for many because of their clumsy, waddling gait \u2013 offer researchers a useful way to measure the health of their habitat. Christian Reiss, an Antarctic fisheries biologist at the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said: \"Penguins are great ambassadors for understanding the need to conserve Southern Ocean resources.\" Two thirds of the world's 18 penguin species, which range from the volcanic Galapagos Islands on the equator to the frozen sea ice of Antarctica, are in decline, according to a Pew study from 2015. Antarctic penguins in particular are vulnerable to climate change as shifting ice reduces their habitat and warming seas affect their prey. Scientists blame the decline in penguin numbers on intense fishing pressure on forage species such as krill, as well as pollution, damage to penguin breeding grounds, and climate change. Only two types of penguin \u2013 the Ad\u00e9lie and the King - are increasing in numbers, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. Penguins live most of their lives at sea but return to land to breed and molt. This makes them important gauges of marine health that are easily accessible to researchers, who can then develop conservation strategies. Stanford University marine scientist Cassandra Brooks said: \"Scientists need to continue working to untangle the complex interactions between climate change and penguin populations.\" The Ross Sea \u2013 one of the last intact marine ecosystems in the world, home to penguins \u2013 is getting a boost. A deal sealed last year by the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources - an international group tasked with overseeing conservation and sustainable exploitation of the Antarctic Ocean - will see a massive US and New Zealand-backed marine protected area in the Ross Sea. The largest of the 18 penguin species found today are emperors. They are around 120cm tall and weigh about 40kg, although their weight fluctuates through the year. But fossils recovered from the Antarctic peninsula reveal that a huge species of penguin which lived around 37 million years ago would have dwarfed emperors \u2013 the ancient penguins may have stood 2 meters tall and weighed up to 115kg. Ad\u00e9lie penguins are one of only five species of penguins that live on the Antarctic continent, the others being the emperor, gentoo, chinstrap and macaroni penguins. Like all penguins, Ad\u00e9lies are excellent swimmers - some have been recorded swimming as far as 300 km (150 km each way) to forage for their chicks.

{"id": null, "body": "     Global temperatures are set to far overshoot an international target to limit the increase, UN scientists say. Another expert study warns of the health risk posed to vulnerable people by the growing number of heatwaves. Global temperatures could rise by 3-5 degrees Celsius (5.4-9.0 degrees Fahrenheit) in the next eight decades if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere increase at the current rate, the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Thursday. In the WMO's annual statement on the state of the climate, Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said that the rise would be \"considerably higher\" than that if all known fossil fuel resources were exploited. The report also said that 2018 was \"on course to be the 4th warmest year on record,\" the other three being 2015, 2016 and 2017. All the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, the WMO said. The predicted 3-5 degree rise far exceeds the target of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels that was set by the world's countries at the 2015 Paris climate conference. Even that goal would require a drastic reduction in the use of the fossil fuels that create many of the greenhouse gases behind global warming. According to scientists, the 2-degree limit is essential if humankind is to avert even partially the ill effects of climate change, including extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes and droughts.

More than 150 million vulnerable people worldwide were affected by potentially dangerous heatwaves last year, it said, while a total of 153 billion work hours were lost owing to unusually hot weather. The executive director of The Lancet Countdown, Nick Watts, said the negative effects of climate warming were being felt right here and now, and not in the distant future. \"For a very, very long time we have thought about climate change as something that affects the environment some time in 2100,\" he told the news agency AFP. But now, he said, it was not \"just affecting polar bears or rainforests; it's something that affects communities, children, families in the UK and Europe and around the world.\" Read more :\u00a0 Great Barrier Reef: \"last-chance\" tourists flock to world wonder as coral disappears \u00a0 tj/rt (Reuters, AFP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change skeptics argue that humans are not to blame for climate change, and they often cherrypick scientific facts to support their argument. We asked researchers to counter three of the most common theories. Most scientists agree that climate change is a real and growing threat. From rising sea levels to melting glaciers and extreme weather patterns, our environment is changing, and they believe humans are largely to blame. But skeptics don\u2019t agree: so-called climate change deniers argue that people have little to no impact on global climate movements. Global Ideas picked three of the most common arguments made by climate skeptics and asked researchers to pick apart the theories behind them.  Theory 1: 'Global warming stopped in 1998' Skeptics don\u2019t believe in global warming, despite mounting evidence like rising sea levels Climate change skeptic blogs are awash with the theory that that there has been no discernible warming of the earth for years \u2013 since 1998. That date is no coincidence since 1998 was a record warm year. That was largely due to El Ni\u00f1o, a meteorological pattern where warm ocean water temperatures spur warmer weather every few years. Skeptics however use 1998 as evidence to argue that the resulting dip in global temperatures points to a major reversal and that global warming has effectively \u201cstopped\u201d since the record warm year. But scientists who assert that greenhouses gases, produced by human activity, are the cause of modern-day climate change, point to flaws in that argument. \u201cIf you compare summer temperatures with winter, you\u2019ll also see a cooling pattern,\u201c Urs Neu, a researcher at the SwissAcademy of Sciences in Bern, says. \u201cWhen you study these trends you have to take several factors into account, including natural ones,\u201c he says. He argues that volcanic eruptions and weather patterns like El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 or the counter phenomenon, La Ni\u00f1a \u2013 produce largely inconclusive results. El Ni\u00f1o is responsible for warm ocean currents in the eastern tropical Pacific, while La Ni\u00f1a generates cooler sea surface temperatures. These fluctuations in the surface temperature of oceans can cause major climatic changes across the globe, from heavy rains in Peru to severe droughts in Australia. \u201cIf you leave such factors out of the equation, you can see very well that global warming is a continuing trend,\u201c says Neu.  Theory 2: 'Long winters, cold summers \u2013 what global warming?' Climate change deniers point to longer winters as a sign of an increasingly cold earth Changing weather patterns are another issue where climate change deniers feel strengthened in their conviction that the world is not actually getting warmer. Many point to the winters in recent years in Central Europe as an example. Measurements by the German Meterological Service shows that winter temperatures have dropped on an average by around two degrees over the last quarter of a century. Sceptics from the European Institute for Climate and Energy have seized on the data to argue that the earth can hardly be warming in face of these falling temperatures.  It may sound paradoxical, but climate researchers say it could be exactly this development that is a result of global warming. It\u2019s important, they say, to look beyond your own borders at the bigger picture. Klaus Dethloff from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research says researchers have been able to prove a statistical correlation between diminishing polar ice in the Antarctic in late summer and a particularly harsh winter in Central Europe and Asia. In other words, the trend towards rising temperatures has continued across the world, regardless of long winters and cool summers in individual regions.  Theory 3: 'Man-made climate change is minor' Skeptics doubt that humans are responsible for climate change A third commonly heard argument heard from climate change doubters is that carbon dioxide is not nearly as dangerous as believed, especially because nature needs the gas to function. Scientists agree that plants do indeed require CO2 to survive, but only enough to maintain a balanced ecosystem. When that ecosystem is intact, says Urs Neu, plants only take in as much CO2 as is emitted. \u201dAs soon as you disrupt that balance and add another source to the mix, the concentration starts to climb and so does the danger to the climate. It\u2019s just like a bathtub: if you only fill it up with as much water as you can drain, it works fine. But if you turn the tap on at full force, at some point the water will overflow,\u201d he says.  Economic reasons driving climate skeptics? And these aren\u2019t the only theories that climate change skeptics to base their arguments on. In their book \u201eThe Cold Sun,\u201c Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian L\u00fcning, for example, argued that we\u2019re approaching a period of decreased solar activity, which will bring a temporary end to climate change. But that\u2019s contradicted by scientists who at best see a marginal change in solar variations. Big oil companies don\u2019t want to see their booming business disrupted Carel Mohn, the press spokesperson for the European Climate Foundation, says economic reasons lie behind many of the climate doubters\u2019 arguments. \u201cIn industrialized countries, you have major companies that depend on extracting fossil fuels from the earth and exploiting them. Of course they have an interest in keeping that business model running as long as possible,\u201c he says, adding that climate skeptics in developed nations are especially powerful. Hartmut Gra\u00dfl, a climate researcher and the former director at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, says there is a political component to climate skepticism. \u201cSome of them even get paid, by big oil companies for example, to undermine climate change,\u201c he says. Gra\u00dfl believes small groups, financed by big interests, are often sent to climate conferences to listen to the arguments at hand and find ways to dispute them.  Questionable theories  Scientists accuse climate skeptics of simply cherry picking the theories that suit them best, rather than accepting the entire truth. \u201cThey dig around for results that fit their argument and then combine them to create a plausible story so that the ordinary person thinks that climate research is misleading,\u201d Carel Mohn says. His organization\u2019s website aims to use climate education and awareness to knock the the wind out of climate skeptics\u2019 sails. Hartmut Gra\u00dfl says climate skepticism is primarily \u201ccharlatanism.\u201d He stressed that most skeptics are laypersons and hard to find in serious scientific circles and communities. In the scientific field, publications are subject to a system of review where content undergoes strict editing. \u201cNinety percent of climate skeptics don\u2019t have the necessary references,\u201d Gra\u00dfl says. Instead, he says, they spread their unsubstantiated beliefs via blogs or media articles. Still, Gra\u00dfl says climate skeptics\u2019 can play a positive role too \u2013 sometimes they can be helpful in kickstarting a discussion. \u201cBut often the debates take place at a level where, as a scientist, it\u2019s simply better to say nothing at all,\u201d he says.

{"id": null, "body": "     No scientific study has found that climate change is likely to wipe out civilization, but for many even the possibility is terrifying enough to upend their lives. Rich countries like the US and Australia have seen apocalyptic images of climate change after smoke from wildfires darkened skies above big cities When Typhoon Vamco battered the Philippines in November last year, unleashing a month's worth of rain on the capital Manila in less than 24 hours, Mitzi Jonelle Tan was on her way home from work. Her mother, scared for Tan's safety as roads flooded , warned her not to come back. That was the last she heard from her mother for three days. \"We had no electricity, we barely had any cellular signal,\" said Tan, who stayed with a friend during the storm as people clambered onto rooftops to escape two-storey high floodwaters. \"I had no idea if my mom was OK, if I had a home to come home to.\" Like most Filipinos, Tan is no stranger to devastating cyclones \u2014 Typhoon Goni , one of the strongest storms ever recorded, barely missed Metro Manila and its 13 million residents when it made landfall just two weeks earlier. But Tan, co-founder of Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines, also carries a mental burden: She knows such storms will grow stronger as the planet heats up. \"Even today, without runaway climate change, we're already suffering,\" said Tan, a 22-year-old math graduate who remembers helping her parents scoop floodwater out of the house as a child and weeks of doing homework by candlelight when storms cut off electricity. \"I have fears of drowning in my own bedroom when I hear another typhoon is coming.\" Mitzi Jonelle Tan, pictured left, lives in the second-most dangerous country for environmental activists, according to NGO Global Witness Citizens of the Philippines are adjusting to tropical cyclones that are growing even stronger The emotional toll of climate change is often made worse by an existential\u00a0debate\u00a0riddled with misinformation: Just how much\u00a0can society take before it breaks down? Before Tan reaches the age of her mother, who is 58, sea levels will have risen so high that coastal floods that used to strike once a century will swamp Manila and dozens of other cities every single year. Wildfires that smother towns in the US and Australia with choking smoke will feast on plants dried to a crisp by hotter, longer heatwaves. At least one-quarter of the ice in the Hindu Kush Himalayas will have melted, raising tensions for\u00a01.5 billion people who already rely on its rivers for water in three countries armed with nuclear weapons: India, China and Pakistan. Heatwaves and drought leave dry fuel that helps wildfires spread out of control Groups like the Deep Adaptation Forum \u2014 an online support group for 12,000 people\u00a0\u2014 believe climate-fueled societal breakdown is \"inevitable, likely or already unfolding.\" Their claims\u00a0have tapped into a wider public fear that\u00a0collapse is on the cards. A YouGov poll at the start of the coronavirus pandemic found that three\u00a0in 10 US adults think there will be an apocalyptic disaster within their lifetime. A separate poll of five countries in 2019 found that more than half of respondents in France, Italy, the UK and the US think civilization as they know it will collapse in years to come. In Germany that figure was slightly lower, at 39%. Tan\u00a0said she cried \"night after night\" upon reading reports that world leaders are likely to miss their target of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius this century. \"For a time, I lost hope, thinking: Is everything really just impossible now?\" In February a landslide in the Himalayas that melted ice sent floods downstream that killed scores and trapped hundreds in tunnels Despite widespread fears, no peer-reviewed research finds that the breakdown of society or the collapse of civilization is likely, let alone inevitable. Scientists used to debunking myths from climate deniers say they must also fight\u00a0off\u00a0claims of collapse that hinge on distorted science. Still, climate disasters could disrupt politics in some regions enough that \"the glue that holds society together doesn't work very well anymore,\" said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences at the University of Princeton. \"But that's where we're getting into the realm of things that are unpredictable.\" \"We know that we won't be fine, but there's a lot of space between fine and doomed,\" said Jacquelyn Gill, an associate professor of Paleoecology at the University of Maine's Climate Change Institute. \"That space is our greatest asset because it allows us to choose our future.\" Breeding conditions for the locust swarms that ravaged farms across East Africa were made more likely by climate change Renewable energy has grown so cheap that world leaders could cut fossil fuel emissions swiftly In December, 250 people from a range of mostly academic backgrounds\u00a0signed an open letter \u00a0that described the collapse of civilization as a credible scenario this century. \"It's not a scientific position, it's a philosophical one,\" said Raphael Stevens, an independent researcher who\u00a0helped draft the letter. \"To avoid [collapse], we have to talk about it.\" Climate scientists are experts in the physical phenomena, \"but who has the expertise about what those physical changes are going to cause to happen in the world?\" asked Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist and activist who has written a self-help book about the climate emergency. Of the 2 million-odd people who visit the Great Barrier Reef annually, a 2016 survey found that 69 percent were coming to see the UNESCO World Heritage site \"before it's too late.\" And no wonder. The IPCC says that even if we manage to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, 99 percent of the world's coral will be wiped out. Tourists can hasten their demise by touching or polluting reefs. And what's the carbon cost of flying to remote natural wonders under threat? A 2010 study found that the business of polar-bear safaris in Churchill, Canada, had an annual CO2 footprint of 20 megatons. Most visitors arrived by plane, and while 88 percent of them said humans were responsible for climate change, only 69 percent agreed that air travel was a contributing cause. Along with the polar bear, one of the most iconic images of climate change must be the dramatic curves of an iceberg sculpted by the warming atmosphere. Gliding between the melting giants on a cruise ship is a haunting experience that tourists will pay huge sums for. In the early 1990s just 5,000 people visited Antarctica each year, compared to over 46,000 in 2018. You don't have to go to the poles to see vanishing ice. Kilimanjaro's snowy peaks are a striking sight above the equatorial savannah of the national park, which generates \u20ac44 million ($50 million) from tourism annually. Many visitors climb to the Furtw\u00e4ngler Glacier \u2014 where 85 percent of the ice has vanished over the last century. The rest is unlikely to survive much beyond mid-century. When Montana's Glacier National Park opened in 1910, it boasted over 100 of the ice features from which it took its name. Now, there are fewer than two dozen. So dramatic is their retreat, that the park has become a center of climate science research. Some 3 million hikers and holidaymakers also visit the \"crown of the continent\" each year, soaking in the dying days of its ice-capped glory. The Maldives are the archetypal tourist paradise: 1,200 coral islands with white beaches rising just 2.5 meters above the turquoise waters. In 2017, the president decided to build new airports and megaresorts to accommodate seven times as many tourists, and use the revenue to build new islands and relocate communities. He has since been voted out of office and faces corruption charges. It's not just islands that are going under as sea levels rise. Wetlands like Florida's Everglades are disappearing too. Over the last century, around half the Everglades have been drained and turned over to agriculture. Now, saltwater is seeping into what's left, making it the only critically endangered World Heritage site in the United States. The Galapagos will be forever associated with Darwin, who realized their unique wildlife had evolved over countless generations in isolation. Today, they are besieged by visitors and environmental changes are happening too fast for species to adapt. Ocean warming has left iconic creatures like the marine iguana starving, while UNESCO lists tourism among the greatest threats to the archipelago.  Author: Ruby Russell \"The burden of proof is assumed to be with the collapsologists,\" said Salamon, \"but I would like to see proof that 1 billion people can be refugees and not have that collapse.\" She was referring\u00a0to a widely publicized report in September that claimed 1.2 billion people will become climate refugees by 2050. But migration experts from three organizations told DW the\u00a0report\u00a0misused data by summing snapshots of internal displacement to arrive at an exaggerated figure of cross-border migration. The Institute for Economics and Peace, the think tank behind the study, quietly deleted a graph with the incorrect analysis but did not retract the estimate. \"The figure itself, to put it pretty politely, is fiction,\" said Sarah Nash, a political scientist\u00a0at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna. Cities like Karachi, Pakistan, have already been forced to adapt to increasingly extreme weather The\u00a0prospect of collapse has forced scientists and activists to confront a practical question: Does talking about climate change in extreme terms inspire people to act urgently or push them deep\u00a0into despair? \"Doom-mongering, ironically, is one way to disengage us,\" said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University who argues in a new book that it has overtaken denial as a threat to the climate. \"If we are led to believe it's too late to do anything, then why do anything?\" Yet while hope is often held up as the best motivator of action, research has shown that anger and fear are also powerful drivers of change\u00a0 \u2014 if people feel they can shape their lives.\u00a0 In cities like Jakarta, Indonesia, rising sea levels combine with sinking land to leave coastal communities vulnerable to floods In March, a study in the Journal of Climate Change and Health found that people who felt angry about climate change were more likely to take part in collective action than those who felt\u00a0 anxious about it, and report better mental health than those who feel depressed by it. \"We don't want people to be hopeful, we want people to be angry and we want people to act,\" said Tan. Some people warning of\u00a0collapse are \"obviously channeling their anxieties into action and raising awareness, but they're not the majority of voters,\" added Gill, from the University of Maine, who\u00a0has increasingly received emails from young people feeling hopeless, depressed and even suicidal because of alarmist claims. \"I'm not going to grieve a planet whose obituary hasn't been published yet.\" Young activists in Berlin took a dip in the city's Spree River to demonstrate their desire for more action on climate change. Their protest took place as Germany's upper house of parliament passed a raft of measures aimed at cutting emissions. However, critics of the package said it did not go far enough. Thousands of protesters gathered in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to voice dissatisfaction with a perceived lack of urgency on the part of the government. Some 50,000 people took part, demanding a \"new start\" for the government's climate policy. \"The climate is changing, why aren't we?\" ask these protesters Rome. The historic Italian city of Venice was recently flooded, with the local mayor blaming climate change for the highest tide in 50 years. Climate protests took place in 138 Italian towns and cities, according to Fridays for Future Italia, including in major urban centers like Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples and Palermo. Activists and schoolchildren in Sydney kicked off the latest round of global protests against climate change on Friday by picketing the headquarters of Australia's ruling party. The protesters \u2014 brandishing placards that read \"You're burning our future\" and chanting \"we will rise\" \u2014 turned out as Sydney was again enveloped in toxic smoke caused by bushfires. The protests have taken on extra urgency in Australia \u2014 the country's southeast has been devastated by hundreds of damaging bushfires in recent weeks. Wildfires and drought have left the koala bear on the verge of \"functional\" extinction. Hundreds of people marched through Tokyo's Shinjuku district to show their support for the Fridays For Future movement. Japan is no exception to abnormal weather patterns around the world in recent years. The island nation has been hit by increasingly frequent typhoons, and also by hotter weather. In October, Typhoon Hagibis ripped through central and north-eastern Japan, killing scores of people. Demonstrations also took place in Indonesia, where \u2013 in an effort to to protect tropical forests - the government has issued a temporary ban on permits for palm plantations. However, critics say a lack of transparency has made it difficult to evaluate the moratorium's effectiveness. The global palm oil trade has been blamed as a major contributor to climate change by causing loss of vegetation. In Delhi \u2014 the world's most polluted capital \u2014 students staged a march to the environment ministry carrying placards and demanding that the government declare a climate emergency. The country is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases and has 14 of the 15 most polluted cities in the world, according to a UN study. The protests took place as negotiators from some 200 countries prepared to meet for the COP25 climate conference in Madrid. Participants are seeking clearer rules on how to meet the requirements of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change. The accord aims to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

{"id": null, "body": "     Growth may be central to mainstream economics but nature has paid the price through pollution, waste and climate change. Some economists say it's time for a completely different approach. It was only in the mid-20th century, in the wake of the shattering impact of World Wars and when capitalism and communism were competing for global dominance, that we began to measure the success of an economy in terms of gross national product, or GDP.\u00a0 The faster GDP was rising, the better an economy could be said to be performing. But something happens as all that economic activity expands. The amount of energy and resources we use also increase .\u00a0 Ever since the industrial revolution, fossil fuels have set us on a course of furiously expanding production, which has also meant more waste and more pollution . Historically, greenhouse gas emissions have risen alongside GDP. As economies have grown richer, nature has paid the price .\u00a0 And as the climate crisis has become ever-harder to ignore, more people are questioning whether infinite economic growth is possible on a planet of finite resources .\u00a0 Supporters of degrowth challenge the notion infinite economic growth is possible on a planet of finite resources IPCC modelling of scenarios to keep under 2 degrees of warming, rely on renewables, nuclear power and new technologies Zero-emissions with twice the GDP \"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in their Fifth Assessment , have 116 mitigation scenarios with a chance of staying below the 2 degree Celsius threshold. All of those scenarios assume 2-3% GDP growth rates,\" says Jon Erickson, an ecological economist at the Gund Institute for Environment in Vermont, adding that this implies doubling the global economy by somewhere around 2050 \u00a0. These scenarios rely not just on switching to renewables, but also on the large-scale extraction of massive volumes of carbon from the atmosphere using as-yet unproven technology, which Erickson describes as \"wildly unrealistic.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"None of those models and the IPCC community even bother simulating a scenario where the global economy contracts, stabilizes and maybe even degrows,\" Erickson says. \"Yet that's probably the one realistic scenario that would significantly affect greenhouse gas emissions.\"\u00a0 It is easy to see why the idea that we must keep growing is hard to give up. When economic activity declines and we go into recession, people lose their jobs and are plunged into poverty.\u00a0 Yet those arguing for \"degrowth\" \u2014 a managed contraction of economic activity\u2014 say it doesn't have to be this way.\u00a0 Mainstream economic discourse has been dominated by a focus on growth Time for a different approach? Federico Demaria, an economist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, who has authored several books on degrowth, says that neoclassical economics \u2014 which has dominated economic discourse over recent decades, has \"never looked at the question of how an economy could be managed without growth. It only looked at questions like, why do economies grow? If it's not growing, how can we make it grow? Or, how can we make it grow even faster?\"\u00a0 These have become pertinent questions even \u2014 or especially \u2014 for wealthy, industrialized economies, where growth has slowed over recent decades. \"What the mainstream economists are doing is just trying to relaunch growth,\" Demaria says. A different approach, which aims to rein in growth without inflicting the pain that recession has traditionally entailed, comes from the field of ecological economics.\u00a0 Embedding economics in ecology Neoclassical economic models picture economies as closed systems, with no inputs of materials or energy and no outputs of pollution and waste. But ecological economists insist there is no real separation between economy and ecology. After all, if we destroy the planet that feeds us, economic activity will collapse pretty quickly too.\u00a0 In an effort to fix this oversight, Demaria is among those devising new economic models that include factors like emissions and resources use. They are also working in things like social equality, debt, deficits and monetary systems, which have social impacts, and play into cycles of boom and bust.\u00a0 Proponents of green growth hope renewables will enable growth to continue while protecting the planet Which is why Demaria says their work is attracting attention from surprising quarters.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The main idea of ecological macroeconomics is that the economy is embedded into the environment,\" he says. \"The second problem is that the neoclassical models were not realistic \u2014 look at the financial crisis; they didn't see it coming because they were completely unable to model it. So central banks, for example, are showing a lot of interest in ecological macroeconomics.\" Degrowth vs. green growth\u00a0 Yet mainstream environmentalism is still firmly entrenched in the idea of \"green growth.\" The IPCC, the World Bank , the OECD \u00a0and countless think thanks and national governments rely on us being able to \"decouple\" growth from its ecological impact. And some economies, like Germany, have grown while emissions level off, or even decline.\u00a0 Countless scientific papers \u00a0have been dedicated to the fierce debate over whether these cases represent an absolute break or just a tempering of the link between growth, emissions and resource-use.\u00a0 But proponents of degrowth\u00a0 argue that to date, decoupling has only happened in wealthy economies that have outsourced emissions-heavy sectors like manufacturing to economies like China, and that globally the correlation is still strong.\u00a0 Fossil fuels have set the world on a path of furiously expanding production since the industrial revolution Increased automation has not led to more free time for workers As exemplified by the IPCC scenarios, the argument for \"green growth\" rests on the assumption that technology will save us. By recycling more, swapping energy from fossil fuels to that from renewables, and improving efficiency so we need less of it overall, proponents of green growth hope to keep expanding without sacrificing our planet's ability to feed us and maintain a stable climate. Increased efficiency, greater energy use\u00a0 Yet technological advances don't always have the desired outcome.\u00a0 When new engines that needed less coal to produce the same amount of energy were introduced in the 19th century, coal consumption didn't fall. Instead, better efficiency increased profits, made products cheaper, and drove up demand, meaning coal use actually went up .\u00a0 This trend \u2014 called Jevons paradox \u00a0\u2014 has persisted, meaning that improvements in efficiency tend to come with a rebound effect that wipes out any actual energy savings. Similar effects can be seen in resource use , and even labor, as automation has done more to boost consumption and production than free time for workers \u00a0. In a system geared toward infinite expansion, opportunities to tighten our belts tend to be seized as new ways to keep getting bigger.\u00a0 But degrowthers argue that we do have to tighten our belts \u2014 and it doesn't have to be painful. If we could reverse the central logic of economic systems that prioritize growth over human and ecological wellbeing, they don't believe we would miss the furious activity that's keeping a minority of the human population in must-have products and ever-more material wealth.

McDonald's has borne the brunt of severe criticism due to being viewed as the epicenter of mass produced food and is one of the largest buyers of beef in the world, an industry that has been targeted by climate activists in the past. Donald Trump did not escape the ire of the activists as they began their march to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. The 2020 event will convene nearly 3,000 participants from over 100 countries, including 53 heads of state, among them the US President and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The protesters are angry that these global figures are not doing enough to combat global warming. A man holds a placard suggesting the World Economic Forum needs to be led, and not be the leader, as he takes part in a gathering called by climate activists prior to the start of a march to Davos, where the financial meeting begins on January 22. The hike began in Landquart, in eastern Switzerland and will arrive at the ski resort three days later. People hold placards, many of which have warnings of the ecological repercussions of the actions of humans, as they participate in a gathering called by climate activists prior to the start of a march to Davos. A recent study reported that the world's oceans are warming at an alarming rate, which will most likely contribute to more land crises such as the bushfires currently devastating Australia. A woman wears a hat with a badge reading \"strike for the climate\" as the crowds gathered at the beginning of the hike. The phrase has become synonymous with Greta Thunberg and her climate change movement that began 18 months ago.

Experts warn that participants at the COP24 conference in Poland have to deliver on previous pledges. \"We are the most vulnerable, we are the least responsible but we will suffer the most,\"\u00a0Seyni Nafo, spokesman of the African delegation at the World Climate Conference summed up in an interview with DW.\u00a0The African continent is already experiencing the effects of climate change.\u00a0In\u00a0many places drought, torrential rainfall or flooding are regular occurrences.

Delegates from all over the world have converged\u00a0on the city of Katowice. For James Murombedzi, a climate expert with the UN Economic Commission for Africa, this is the most important climate conference so far. The goal is to reach agreement on a detailed set of rules that would implement the decisions taken at the Paris conference of 2015. Global warming, it was agreed,\u00a0should be limited to 1.5 degrees Celcius.\u00a0This can only succeed if\u00a0emissions of greenhouse gases cease entirely from 2050 onwards \u2013 and they must be drastically reduced in the years leading up to that deadline. However, experts agree that measures taken so far by the international community fall far short of that goal. Mandatory measures are needed, they say.\u00a0 Read more:  Greens: Don't delay ambitious climate action Funds\u00a0to adapt to climate change High on the agenda of the African delegation is also a second pledge made in Paris, namely that poor countries would receive financial help to enable them to adapt to climate change. Starting in 2020 rich industrial nations are expected\u00a0to\u00a0pay an annual amount of 100 billion US dollars. Here, too, no concrete commitments have been made. For negotiator Seyni Nafo, it is vital to ensure that the funds agreed are made available. For some experts, the sum of 100 billion dollars is not enough. Africa is dependent on agriculture and measures must be taken to ensure climate damage is kept to a minimum.\u00a0More investment in irrigation systems is needed, says UN expert Murombedzi. For Nnimmo Bassey, this is not a question of charity or benevolence but of justice.\u00a0 'The planet is burning' Can these goals really be achieved? The US has withdrawn from\u00a0the Paris Agreement, although, as Seyni Nafo puts it: \"Climate change is a common problem and we can only find a common solution.\" He adds optimistically:\u00a0\"We see great interest in many countries in salvaging the multilateral process, in salvaging the outcome of Paris.\"\u00a0 Smog in Katowice regularly blankets the metropolis between November and April There is no guarantee of success for COP24. Fighting climate change means changing the way economic systems function and changing the lifestyle of entire societies, particularly where consumer behavior and mobility are concerned, says Murombedzi. \"Especially in the highly developed countries, there appears to be not enough political will to take on necessary costs.\" Nnimmo Bassey is also skeptical about the chances of COP24\u00a0marking a\u00a0new beginning. \"I hope the delegates, both ministers and technocrats, will actually begin to talk from their hearts and not just from political considerations.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change and a growing population are prompting Germany's capital, Berlin, to rethink how it supplies water. An exceptionally hot and dry 2018 has made the matter even more urgent. Jens Feddern picks up a long-stemmed glass of sparkling liquid, looks at it and tastes. The water from this part of Berlin has a distinct character. Crisp and fresh. In other districts, it has an earthier quality, he explains with the expertise of a sommelier. And he should know. The engineer has been working with the city's water utility Berliner Wasserbetriebe (BWB) since 1987 and is now director of the supply division. That supply comes from underground. The water Feddern has just been sipping was pumped from about 40 meters (131 feet) down from a well in Wuhlheide, one of the city's nine waterworks. Read more :\u00a0 German astronaut Alexander Gerst shocked by parched Earth images from space The BWB supplies some 3.7 million Berliners with around 550,000 cubic meters (145 million gallons, the equivalent of 220 Olympic-sized swimming pools) of water daily. On hot summer days, when people are showering more and watering their gardens, it soars past 1 million. Old pumps at the Wuhlheide waterworks which was built between 1911 and 1916. The facility is still in operation today Such unusually warm and dry spells are generally short-lived enough to mean the wells only have to run at high capacity for four or five days. But 2018 is different. Berlin has had no significant rainfall since February and temperatures have been warmer than average since April. \"The system that we have\u00a0has never experienced what we're now experiencing. The system isn't meant for this,\" Feddern tells DW. In the past, the water utility was a \"sprinter\" over a few hot days. Now it has to be a \"long-distance runner,\" and keep\u00a0 pace for longer. \u00a0 So far, the utility has maintained its stamina, which is due, Feddern says, to investment in the network, careful management and experienced staff. But it's also partly down to luck, he adds. Luck that no pipes have burst or wells have broken under the strain. Luck that there were no electricity shortages. But if long, hot summers become more likely, can the city's infrastructure keep up? Drier, hotter, longer summers Further west in Berlin, J\u00f6rg Riemann sits in a bright airy office and tracks the weather from his computer. Droughts like this would once have led to starvation, but industrialization has tempered those effects, he explains, recalling the last time a summer drought had a direct impact in Germany. That was in 1976. J\u00f6rg Riemann has noted a growing tendency towards more extremes in Germany's weather \"Drinks were running out \u2014 in the former German Democratic Republic anyway,\" says the head meteorologist at Wettermanufaktur, a startup that provides forecasts to help cities, for instance, to prepare for snow, ice, drought or whatever weather conditions are around the corner. Read more :\u00a0 German river levels fall in heat, drought as farmers seek help This year, the period from April to August, has been the sunniest, driest and warmest since records began at the Potsdam weather station in 1893. According to Wettermanufaktur, that combination of factors makes 2018 one of those rare events only likely to occur every 200 to 400 years.\u00a0 Since early spring, Germany has been in the grips of a \"bone-dry easterly weather pattern,\" which is characterized by aridity regardless of the temperature. For now, there is no end in sight, Riemann explains, adding that the past few years have shown a \"tendency to extremes\" such as these. The climate connection Is climate change \u00a0the culprit? It's weather, says Riemann, and researchers can't come to conclusions based on a single year, but have to look at long-term trends over decades. Still, recent studies have connected the European drought to\u00a0 global warming. \u00a0 The effects of this long, hot and dry summer are visible in Germany's rivers and lakes One thing is for sure, this year's combination of record sunshine hours \u2014 and their evaporating effects \u2014 lack of rainfall and long-lasting warm temperatures have caused unusually dry soil conditions and a significant drop in groundwater levels. \"We're a lot lower than we should be,\" says Feddern, and a steady rain would help matters. That said, Berlin isn't about to run out of water because two-thirds of its supply comes from a \"riverbank filtration system,\" that sees water from several of the city's rivers and lakes seep through the soil. And in an extraordinarily hot, dry summer when the rivers are less full, Berlin can hold water using a series of dams. This artificially increases levels, thereby giving groundwater levels a boost. Read More :\u00a0 Berlin and Beyond: Summer in the city While that may be good for the German capital's population, it's not good for aquatic life says Werner Kloas, head of the Department of Ecophysiology and Aquaculture at Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Berlin. \"We have a problem that fish also can't get out,\" he told DW. \"We have too many controlled \u2014 or dammed \u2014 bodies of water.\" Because heat compromises water's ability to absorb oxygen, Kloas says the city's aquatic life is already suffering, and that using dams to slow the flow exacerbates the situation by making oxygenation even more difficult.\u00a0 As this can result in animal deaths and reduce biodiversity generally, he recommends building fish ladders to allow the animals to migrate. Future-proofing Berlin's water supply BWB says it has high\u00a0 biodiversity \u00a0at many of its water sites and has measures in place to protect animals there such as otters and frogs. Jens Feddern of Berlin's water utility says it's also working with the city's government on the \"Water Masterplan\" to ensure faucets don't run dry in the future. As such, the water utility is looking at Berlin's population growth, where new wells could be built, if its pipe network is flexible enough to deal with extreme heat or rainfall and whether the capacity of its waterworks should be increased. It's also collecting and analyzing data to figure out where it should be investing in order to deal with new extremes. Summer 2018 may have been \"exceptional,\" says Feddern, but in the last few years \"something has changed.\" Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, addressing the drought in the state of New South Wales, which produces one-quarter of the country's agricultural output, said, \"Now we are the land of drought.\" Australia recently passed legislation to provide hundreds of millions of dollars worth of relief aid to farmers, including funds for mental health support. Ethiopia has been suffering from ongoing drought conditions since 2015, causing massive food shortages. The Ethiopian government said that some 8.5 million citizens required emergency food assistance in 2017 and that nearly 400,000 infants suffered acute malnutrition. Furthermore, the drought threatens to end traditional nomadic herding in the region. Conservation and late-season rains saved South Africa's Cape Town from an apocalyptic Day Zero scenario, in which water would have to be turned off and emergency rations issued, The drought, which was one of the worst in decades, emptied water reservoirs and caused some experts to suggest hauling icebergs from Antarctica avert a crisis. Europe's sweltering heat has been compounded by a lack of rain. Not only have citizens been suffering the health consequences, which affect health care systems and labor productivity, crops have also been hit hard. Farmers across the continent fear bankruptcy due to poor crops and the EU Joint Research Center predicts \"an increase in drought frequency and intensity in the future.\" Greece has been facing the dual problem of flash flooding in some regions and drought in others. Crete's farmers said they could lose up to 40 percent of their crop this year due to an extremely dry winter. Though they are watering, they say it is not enough to nourish their crops. Water levels are so low that previously submerged villages have begun to reappear in reservoirs across the country. Sweden, which has not seen rain for over three months, is experiencing its worst drought since 1944. The situation threatens to cause severe crop losses costing farmers hundreds of thousands of euros. Sweden has been the site of massive forest fires and has even seen temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Arctic Circle. The United Kingdom fears serious threats to its food supply chain due to the effects of this summer's drought. The country's National Farmers Union said the country is experiencing \"tinderbox conditions.\" This adds to problems brought on by the prospect of needed self-reliance in the event of a no-deal Brexit. India has been plagued by water shortages due to rising population and mismanagement but also aggravated by drought, causing many areas of the country to run out of water. Bangalore was recently added to the list of global cities most likely to run out of drinking water. Other cities on the list include Cape Town, South Africa; Jakarta, Indonesia and Sao Paolo, Brazil. The US government said 29 percent of the country is currently experiencing drought, with conditions affecting some 75 million people. Although wildfires in California have captured the world's attention, farming states, like Kansas, have once again been suffering. Kansas was one of the states crippled by the famous 1930s Dust Bowl.

The price for fruit and vegetables would not increase that much, the researchers found Earlier this year,\u00a0German\u00a0Agriculture\u00a0Minister Julia\u202fKl\u00f6ckner\u202fblamed discounter supermarkets for their\u00a0\"dumping prices,\"\u00a0especially when it comes to meat. She also criticized the\u00a0double standards of\u00a0customers,\u00a0who are often not willing to pay fair prices for their groceries.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0 Now one of Germany's discounters, Penny, part of\u00a0the\u202fRewe\u202fsupermarket\u00a0group,\u202fhas asked the researchers to calculate the true cost of eight of their\u00a0products. Customers\u00a0shopping at one of their stores in the Berlin district of Spandau are shown the true cost of these products next to the\u00a0store's\u00a0retail price.\u00a0\u00a0 And the result may well be a shock to many of them.\u00a0The price of meat rises\u00a0the most, with conventionally farmed products going up 173% and even organic ones more than doubling their cost. Milk also greatly goes up\u00a0in price, with a 122% rise when coming from a normal dairy and a\u00a069% increase when from an organic source. Researcher Michalke said the idea behind the experiment is to show that organic produce is actually cheaper in the long run than conventional farming. \"Consumers\u00a0would\u00a0be incentivized to buy these products. And then\u00a0producers would also be incentivized to maybe switch their\u202fagricultural practices,\" she said.\u00a0 However, only eight out of roughly 3,500 products available at the supermarket currently carry that true cost price tag.\u00a0 \"If we realize the experiment is working, for example because people start buying organic produce more, then as a next step we would have the true costs of more products calculated and roll out the experiment in more branches to increase visibility,\" Penny spokesperson Andreas\u00a0Kr\u00e4mer\u202ftold DW.\u202f\u202f\u00a0 Researchers calculated milk prices would increase by 122%, gouda cheese by 88% and mozzarella by 52% \"I believe the trend is that even discount customers want to go shopping with a good conscience and want to know where their food is coming from, how it was produced and whether it harms the environment,\"\u00a0he said.\u202f\u00a0 He also\u00a0pointed out\u00a0the goal\u00a0was not to suddenly raise prices and sell products based on their real costs.\u202f\"We just want to sensitize our customers. Food has to remain affordable for everyone, so of course we have to think about how we can support people who do not have much leeway in their budget,\"\u202fKr\u00e4mer\u202fsaid.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0 He believes it's a long way until the true cost of food will be implemented.\u202f\u202f Michalke\u202fbelieves\u202fa CO2 tax\u202fwould\u202fhelp allocate costs to make all the stakeholders along the value chain\u202fpay\u00a0up \u2014\u00a0and not just the customers.\u202f\u202f\u00a0 However, she\u00a0believes educating people is an important first step.\u202f\u202f\u00a0 \"People do have to understand that it is not normal to have these cheap prices for food before we can shift the dynamics and shift the system,\"\u00a0she said.\u202f\u202f 'It is quite shocking how high the external price factors are for some animal products,' said researcher Michalke \u202fAt the grocery store, some customers have welcomed the initiative.\u00a0\u00a0 Monika\u202fLanzke said she knew food would be a bit more expensive if we cared for our climate, but said she wasn't aware of how huge the difference would be.\u00a0\"But I'd be happy to pay more if this benefits our environment.\"\u202f\u00a0 Andrea Leo believes if food were to get more expensive in the future, people may also be less wasteful and buy more consciously.\u00a0\"I come from a large family that didn't have a big budget for food and in those\u202ftimes\u202fthere weren't all these cheap offers, so we just had meat and animal products on the weekend and that was totally fine,\"\u00a0she said.\u202f\u00a0 Others, like\u202fIngo\u202fJucht, who came to Penny to buy some groceries with his daughter, are worried when they see how much the prices would increase and don't want to change their shopping behavior.\u202f\u00a0 \"I'm a little shocked,\u00a0because the costs for my shopping would basically triple and that is not nice for an average person. I like the fact that groceries are so cheap in Germany, and I would continue buying the cheaper product if I have the choice,\"\u202fhe said.\u202f\u00a0 Compared to other European\u202fcountries, Germany's prices are cheaper because of fierce competition between large retailers.\u00a0\u00a0 \"We have a comparatively high concentration of supermarkets on the German market and a merciless competition between large retailers, which leads\u00a0to prices being very low. This competition is further fueled by discounters, where prices play a huge role, which then brings\u00a0price levels down across the country,\"\u202fKr\u00e4mer\u202fsaid.\u202f\u00a0 He\u202fadmitted\u00a0that discount supermarkets are part of the problem,\u00a0but he also believes they can be part of the solution if they give customers more information and alternatives.\u202f\u202f\u00a0 \"We don't value food as much as other countries just because it has always been so\u00a0cheap\u00a0or it has grown to be so cheap,\"\u202fMichalke\u00a0said.\u00a0\u00a0 Apart from current research in the Netherlands that's looking into nitrogen emissions from pork production, there isn't a single country in the world that currently factors in ecological and social impacts of food production, according to Michalke. \"And that's a conversation that we should\u00a0be\u00a0having\u00a0across the world.\"\u00a0 While scientists don't yet know exactly how COVID-19 originated, recent pandemic virus threats such as swine flu and bird flu almost certainly evolved at pig and chicken factory farms. With a link already established between intensive animal agriculture and an increased pandemic risk, it might be the moment to rethink factory farming at its current scale. The pandemic has also cast a light on the poor conditions in the meat processing industry. Germany has seen several coronavirus outbreaks among meat factory employees, and has even put two districts in western Germany in quarantine after more than 1,550 workers at the T\u00f6nnies slaughterhouse were infected with the disease. Calls are growing for better regulations throughout the meat branch. Experts believe the coronavirus likely came from wildlife sold at a wet market in Wuhan, China. In the wake of the pandemic, China clamped down on the wildlife trade, shutting down almost 20,000 wildlife farms. Some Chinese provinces are now offering government support to help wildlife farmers transition away from the practice, and switch to growing crops or raising pigs or chickens instead. The pandemic has impacted our food supply chain. An industry evolved to feed a globalized world has been scaled back to the local level in some cases. From reduced access to animal fodder to shortages of labor, farmers are having to consider how to adapt to a new and uncertain future. Forced to spend more time at home, increasing numbers of people have been trying their hand at growing their own food. This could be a positive development in the long run. With more than two-thirds of the world's population projected to live in cities by 2050, urban farming will become more crucial - and it requires less fossil fuel for transport and less land than conventional agriculture. With our planet's population expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, there's no escaping the fact that food production around the world needs to increase. While opening up more land was once seen as an obvious solution to this problem, a stronger focus on urban farming and concerns over the consequences of encroaching into nature could spark a rethink of how we use land. As awareness of the potential health costs of the meat market grows, China has witnessed an increasing interest in plant-based products. The West has already experienced a trend towards plant-based diets over the past few years, and that is likely to continue as consumers become more concerned over the origins of meat products. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to impact developing countries heavily \u2013 particularly in terms of food security. The UN has already warned of famine \"of biblical proportions\" as resources become scarcer. Alongside immediate aid, mitigating widespread famine in the long-term will require better land protection, more diversified crops and more support for smallholder farmers who are most at risk.

{"id": null, "body": "     Coronavirus has cut emissions faster than years of climate negotiations. Does the outbreak reveal what life might be like if we were to act seriously on climate change? Or what it might be like if we don't? China, the world's biggest greenhouse gas polluter, has no plans to cut its emissions anytime soon. Under its Paris Agreement pledges, Beijing has promised to hit peak\u00a0 emissions \u00a0 by 2030. So for the next decade, they're only going to go up. Yet suddenly, this colossal, coal-powered economy has slashed emissions by 25%, according to numbers crunched by Lauri Myllyvirta at the University of Helsinki's Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Not because of the climate crisis, but the COVID-19 public health emergency . \"For something like this to happen virtually overnight is very much unprecedented,\" Myllyvirta told DW. Wuhan, the 11 million-strong Hubei province city at the center of the coronavirus \u00a0outbreak has been on lockdown since late January. With businesses and factories in the province shuttered, and hundreds of millions of people across the country rendered immobile by sweeping travel restrictions, the atmosphere above China in NASA satellite images appears virtually clean of nitrous oxide emissions. NASA data shows a dramatic fall in nitrous oxide, a pollutant emitted from fossil fuels, after China put the breaks on its economy to contain coronavirus Around the world, the aviation industry is predicting significant losses, British airline Flybe has collapsed, sporting events and international conferences have been cancelled, schools closed. Economists are warning of possible recession in Chinese trading partners Germany \u00a0and Japan, while global growth is predicted to slow and oil demand has fallen faster than at any time since the 2008 financial crash. All this\u00a0looks like good news for the planet \u2014 at least in the short term. \"Suppose you were a policymaker, and you were thinking about what you would do to lower emissions \u2014 you just got a pretty good instruction,\" says Amy Jaffe, director of the Council on Foreign Relations' Energy Security and Climate Change program.\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 EU unveils law committing to climate neutrality by 2050 Learning to localize Jaffe says the virus is prompting us to change our habits in ways that could make a longer-term contribution to climate protection \u2014 working from home, video conferencing, working shorter weeks or staggering office hours to reduce traffic. The streets of normally bustling Beijing were deserted in early February when the Chinese government extended the new year holiday to tackle the CORVID-19 Towns and villages in Italy have emptied as the virus has spread Companies might also conclude that what's good for the planet \u2014 localized production \u2014 is a sensible way to protect their supply chains from all kinds of risk, such as extreme weather events linked to climate change. \"They really need to go and think about all these events that could actually disrupt their supply chain and think about what they're going to do to make it more resilient,\" Jaffe told DW. Still, the biggest share of emissions saved in China over recent weeks comes from the slowdown in manufacturing, and that's something few politicians would advocate as official policy beyond an immediate crisis. Smokestack rebound? In China, Myllyvirta says the pressure to resume business as usual is so great there have been reports of local governments ordering workerless factories to run their machines just to use up power, with the expectation that their superiors will be looking at electricity consumption as a sign of recovery. After the 2008 financial crash, \"which also led to a dramatic drop-off in China's emissions and marked improvement in air quality because export industries went into freefall,\" Myllyvirta says the government launched a massive, construction-heavy stimulus program that saw emissions surge. Such stories don't bode well for the climate in a post-crisis scenario when the country is keen to get the economy back up and running . Chinese factories may be expected to make up for lost time as the Chinese economy gets going again Myllyvirta says state investment in \"smokestack industries\" geared to maintaining the country's growth target could see rebound emissions more than cancel out savings over the last few weeks. He hopes China might instead opt for a path of slower, \"high quality\" growth, based on services, household consumption and investment in green technology and renewables. Others argue that boosting consumption always comes at a cost to the planet, and the global obsession with expanding GDP makes little more sense than running empty production plants just to get the numbers up. A managed contraction \"The only time we see emissions significantly reduce is when countries \u2014 or the globe \u2014 goes into recession,\" says Jon Erickson, an ecological economist at the University of Vermont's Gund Institute who studies emerging infectious disease vectors in relation to climate change. \"These moments really point to how intimately greenhouse gas emissions are tied to economic growth,\" Erickson told DW. While recessions are good for the climate, they're terrible for people \u2014 particularly those who already benefit least from our fossil-fuel economies. Among the hardest hit by China's coronavirus response are low-waged migrant workers already living precarious lives. The economic impact of coronavirus has rippled out well beyond China's borders. Business is slow in Bangkok's Chinatown, which would normally be flooded with tourists Global supply chains have been disrupted by the virus Yet advocates of a managed contraction of economic activity to protect the climate say shocks like the current outbreak illustrate the stark choices before us. \"We never want to do things in crisis mode,\" Erickson says. Instead, we have a \"five to 10 year window\" to \"completely transform the economy so that the worst side of the contraction can be reduced, so that we can protect those who are most vulnerable.\" Read more: \u00a0 Can we consume less without wrecking the economy? If that sounds ridiculously optimistic, recent weeks at least suggest that when a crisis is deemed urgent enough, the world can act big and fast. \"If we truly treat climate as an emergency, as we are treating this pandemic as an emergency, we have to have a similar level of international coordination,\" Erickson says, starting with rapid scaling-back of fossil fuel investments. A taste of future crises Transmitting person-to-person and sending economic tremors across six continents, coronavirus has highlighted how closely interconnected our global community is. The ripple effect through supply chains also reveals our collective responsibility for emissions, as China's factories supply businesses and consumers in the West.\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 Will COVID-19 exacerbate drugs shortage in Germany? Neglecting that responsibility could mean crashes and crises far more painful than anything we've seen yet. Japan is among the countries that could be hard hit by the economic fallout from coronavirus With a global death toll of over 3,000, COVID-19 still appears far less deadly than fossil fuels, which, according to a recent study that Myllyvirta co-authored for Greenpeace, are responsible for 4.5 million air pollution-related deaths each year, aside from climate impacts. But scientists warn that warmer, wetter conditions are increasing\u00a0the probability of such outbreaks. No one knows how deadly the next one might be. Read more:\u00a0 Climate change has become a health emergency \"This is an opportunity to talk about planned economic stabilization, and talk about planned degrowth,\" Erickson says. \"The economy will contract, it will hit limits, it will crash, it will collapse on its own. That's going to hurt the most.\" In Antarctica, scientists measured temperatures on par with Los Angeles. In February, a record 18.3 degrees Celsius (64.9 degrees Fahrenheit) was measured at the Argentinean research station Esperanza Base in the north Antarctic. This was the highest temperature since measurements began there, according to NASA. The warm weather led to quickly developing melt ponds (pictured right). As oceans warm, the intensity of tropical cyclones will increase. The hurricane or typhoon season will last longer and there will be significantly more hurricanes, especially in the North Atlantic and the northeast Pacific. Extreme weather conditions will result in extremely destructive storms in the future, even in regions that have so far been spared. Oceans warm along with the rising temperatures of the Earth's atmosphere, albeit with a delay. This leads to a thermal expansion of the water masses, causing sea levels to rise further. The habitats and livelihoods of numerous coastal inhabitants \u2014 especially in poorer regions \u2014 will be lost. While there will be heavy precipitation and flooding in some places, extreme weather conditions elsewhere will cause very dry periods. Crop failures and devastating forest fires will be the result. The fire season will last much longer in many places, and the number of fires will increase dramatically. Warmer oceans will drive species, and eventually entire marine ecosystems, into colder regions. Fish and marine mammals will migrate toward the poles, just like land animals. The cod populations in the North Sea, for example, are already shrinking faster than can be explained by overfishing alone. Fishing regions further north could benefit from this development. Heating causes CO2 to dissolve directly in surface water, the pH value of seawater then decreases and the water \"acidifies.\" Mussels, starfish, corals, crabs and sea urchins lose their ability to form exoskeletons or endoskeletons in these conditions. This means that they will disappear, leading to unfiltered water and a lack of food for other marine life. As the pH value decreases due to increased CO2 absorption, small algae aren't able to absorb as much iron. But plankton needs this mineral for strong growth. Since many phytoplankton species also form calcareous skeletons, they are likely to be affected by acidified water. Warmer water stores less oxygen, so warming oceans lead to expanding areas that are oxygen-poor. In many rivers, lakes and lagoons, oxygen-poor \"death zones\" already exist where animals can't live because too little oxygen is dissolved in the water. In warm, oxygen-poor water, toxic algae bloom and can multiply explosively. Their poison kills fish and other sea creatures. Algae carpets are already threatening the fishing industry and tourism in many places. Here is a picture from Chile's coast, where red algae killed thousands of fish with their nerve poison. Warming oceans cause coral to lose not only its color but also its ability to reproduce, as a result of heavy coral bleaching. Coral reefs die off and provide no protection, no food and no hunting grounds for a variety of marine life. If the North Atlantic Current were to be interrupted by ocean warming, it would result in a severe cold spell throughout western and northern Europe. This is because the current ensures the continuous circulation of seawater as dense surface water sinks into deeper, cooler layers. The other oceanic currents would also be affected by such an interruption.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change has slowly damaged traditional crops. Now farmers on the Italian island of Sicily are looking for innovative alternatives to survive and even thrive. When Andrea Passanisi started cultivating mangoes and avocados in his family's vineyard on the slopes of Mount Etna in 2001, he was just 17. His neighbors, who were more used to olives and oranges , thought he was crazy. \"I wanted to tell a different Sicilian tale,\" he said. \"One of adaptation and future vision.\" So Passanisi removed old plants, introduced new ones, and founded Sicilia Avocado, an eco-friendly company that now exports organic avocados, passion fruit\u00a0and finger limes across Europe and China. The law graduate-turned-farmer is part of a new generation of Sicilian cultivators, taking advantage of the 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degree Fahrenheit) temperature rise to redefine the island's agricultural profile by producing in harmony with nature while simultaneously adapting to the changing local climate. The conditions on Sicily now are ideal for forays into more exotic crops \u2014 and animals. Obviously, dromedaries are desert animals, like these Moroccan ones. But for some years now, Etna has been their home, too Beyond crops and plants In 2013, the Gjmala farm in the village of Trecastagni, began breeding a small number of dromedaries for milk production. \"The higher temperatures have definitely influenced the adaptation and resistance of these animals here in Sicily, and helped me recreate their original habitat more easily,\"\u00a0 Santo Fragala, a vet and breeder who owns Gjmala, told DW. Although he says consumers are not yet used to exotic businesses like his, he believes both consumers and entrepreneurs are slowly starting to understand that climate adaptation also offers some opportunities. That is good for farmers such as Alberto Continella in whom Passanisi found a mentor for his entrepreneurial endeavors. Continella's father started an avocado export enterprise in the 1960s, when such crops were pretty much unheard of in Sicily. Now, their tropical garden is the biggest on the island, and home to towering green 50-year-old avocado trees. With over two decades of experience under his belt, Continella is happy to share his knowledge. \"Farmers in Sicily are usually very independent and avoid cooperating with their peers because they fear competition,\" he said. \"We want to promote the opposite of that in the exotic production field, and teach other tropical wannabe farmers\u00a0the required know-how to not fail.\" For most of us olive trees are traditionally Italian \u2014 can we someday think of avocados the same way? Matching crops with climates Adequate water is one of the keys to achieving that. He and Passanisi believe that by working together, farmers can share the cost of irrigation and more effectively push for an overhaul of the island's outdated irrigation infrastructure, which, often built with shoddy materials, leads to water waste. They also say that an understanding of Sicily's microclimates and soil properties enable cultivators to plant their crops in places best suited to their needs. Read more:\u00a0 Organic farmers protecting Italy's rich food tradition The area of Giarre, a small town tucked between Mount Etna and the Mediterranean\u00a0lends itself, not least because of the water flowing beneath the soil, to the kind of tropical crops to which Sicilia Avocado puts its name. \"The soil, made more fertile by Etna's ashes, and the purity of the water extracted from this specific subsoil, gives each fruit special and valuable organoleptic properties, and makes it the ideal space for cultivating such plants,\" Passanisi explained. Around Etna, the generation of the under-30-year-olds feels the urge to try to make a living with agriculture \u2014 many are trying with tropical fruits Back to their roots The entrepreneur wants to \"share this new philosophy and entrepreneurial spirit\" and is keen to \"inspire\" younger generations trying to breathe new life into old family lands. But he also warns against jumping on the tropical bandwagon that attracted many farmers alarmed by news of climate change and partial losses of their more traditional crops. \"They thought it would solve their economic problems,\" he said. \"But most of the time, they don't have the practical knowledge or guidance to help boost such ventures, and know very little about climate or how to adapt their crops to it.\" Carlo Aranzulla is a 25-year-old farmer by day and radiologist by night who has dug up his grandmother's uncultivated lands in the province of Syracuse in eastern Sicily, to start his own organic orange\u00a0and finger lime farm. Also a representative of Coldiretti, Italy's farming association, he says there's a determination among the young generation to make a go of a rural existence. Read more:\u00a0 Italian organics scandal highlights importance of improved certification process in Europe \"I've seen many of my university classmates trying agriculture as a side career, although they studied economics or law at university,\" he said. \"Some of them have even quit their studies to fully commit to the farming profession.\" There is already a market for Sicily's tropical produce in Germany and Belgium, but local consumers are now increasingly adapting to the exotic flavor of more uncommon fruit, such as annona and feijoa. And the trend toward\u00a0consuming zero-mile products, both for health and sustainability reasons, is helping to accelerate the process. For Passanisi, it's just the beginning of this new Sicilian farming tale. \"I think this Mediterranean island can and will unexpectedly offer some interesting sustainable growth opportunities in the tropical field,\" he said, as his silhouette disappeared into a grove overlooking Mount Etna.  \u00a0 The \"Food Report 2016\" compiled by nutritionist and trend researcher Hanni R\u00fctzler pinpoints three developing trends. She calls the first one \"spiritual food.\" Whether vegetarian, vegan, halal or kosher, consumers are increasingly reflecting on the ethics of food. \"Fast good\" is a label that borrows on \"fast food,\" yet in this case, people want their quickly prepared meals to nevertheless be nutritious. Fresh and regional ingredients make up such dishes. Hispanic, Asian and Arabic influences provide creative inspiration. Grabbing a quick bite on the go didn't start with the invention of food trucks. Yet some of them specialize in preparing \"infinite food,\" as another new trend is called. For example, the Swagman truck (pictured) offers in the Bayreuth region of Germany slow-roasted meat and homemade mashed potatoes instead of hamburgers and fries. Whether in Cologne, Paris or New York, inside or outside, street food festivals offer a taste of the latest culinary trends. Every week in Berlin's Markthalle Neun (pictured), the event \"Street food Thursday\" showcases how traditional food, from Mexican tacos to West African fufu, can be turned into creative bites. So-called hybrid foods have been popping up for a while already. This picture shows a \"cronut,\" which was a trend in New York in 2013. More examples of hybrids: Ramen noodles replace the bread - or the patty - in \"ramen burgers,\" and a \"bruffin\" is brioche-like muffin. Instead of heading out to the supermarket and sweating in a queue, you can now simply order \"cooking boxes\" online. Simple recipes come with all the ingredients you need to make them. Though there is no official definition of \"superfoods,\" they are known to be packed with nutrients. Because of its antioxidant qualities, the acai berry is one of them. Some claim it has anti-ageing properties and can protect against diseases. This South American berry has a particular taste - earthy and nutty. Some regional products are also considered superfoods, such as cabbage, which is packed with vitamin C. Though it is traditionally served with minced meat and potatoes, some people like to experiment with it, using cabbage for example to replace the dough in pizza or quiche, or to prepare smoothies. Forget brunch, organize a \"brinner\" instead: It's breakfast and dinner all-in-one, as you get to eat your breakfast favorites - with a twist - in an evening meal. Some suggestions for the menu: Tortillas with scrambled eggs or a hash browns, bacon and sausage casserole. If ever you need a snack after that huge meal, popcorn is the way to go. Without butter, it is surprisingly low-cal. Some are now replacing croutons in salads with popcorn and even using it to make ice cream. Whoever still needs inspiration to cook can spend hours watching food videos online - it's a booming trend.

{"id": null, "body": "     The Kyoto Protocol, which created the first binding targets to limit greenhouse gas emissions, went into effect in February 2005. Some experts say it was a \"game changer,\" but others question its long-term effectiveness. \"It was tingling all the way to the end,\" said climate scientist and lawyer Hermann Ott, describing the marathon negotiations that stretched into the early hours of the morning and charted the course for humanity's fight against climate change . \"Up to the last moment we were trembling about whether it would fail in the last few meters.\" The result of the talks, which came into force eight years later, was the Kyoto Protocol: the first binding treaty under international law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a milestone in international climate policy. It set the tone for everything that followed, said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Center for Climate Change and Development. First conceived in 1992 at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 which underlined the historical responsibility of rich countries for emitting greenhouse gases \u2014 the Kyoto Protocol made concrete how big emitters\u00a0should take the lead in slowing climate change. One hundred and forty-one\u00a0countries had ratified it by 2005. The treaty committed 38 industrialized nations to reducing emissions of climate-damaging gases by an average of 5.2%\u00a0by 2012\u00a0below 1990 levels. The signatories included the US and EU, known at the time as the European Community. \"That's the first time we had anything in international law that was so binding,\" said Huq, who was involved in the negotiations for developing countries. \"That was a breakthrough.\" A global climate movement has been led by protesters born after the Kyoto Protocol was signed Huge success and yet too little When the US \u2014 responsible for a large part of historic CO2 emissions \u2014 withdrew from the agreement in 201, and Canada in 2011, many observers thought the Kyoto Protocol had failed. But by 2012, the emissions of the industrialized countries had dropped 20% from 1990 levels \u2014 five times the Kyoto targets of the remaining nations. The EU cut emissions by 19%, and Germany by 23%. Over the same period, however, global emissions rose by around 38%. The agreement is not enough to limit the rise in global warming in the long term, said Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, because it only applied to countries responsible for a quarter of global emissions. \"That's just not enough to deal with the problem. You have to get an agreement with greater participation.\" Trading carbon More than just cutting emissions, the agreement introduced the Clean Development Mechanism to trade carbon . This meant countries that did not meet reduction targets could \"buy\"\u00a0the right to extra emissions from the budgets of less-polluting countries. They could also offset them through climate protection measures in developing countries. One percent of the revenue from emissions trading has gone into a fund for adapting to climate change, which is spent on measures such as reforesting mangroves, building dams and limiting erosion in mountainous regions in developing countries. About $10 billion (\u20ac9.2 billion) has flown into projects via the fund and emissions trading, according to the World Bank. Asia and Africa have faced tough choices between raising living standards and limiting emissions Global trade in emissions proved less successful than negotiators had hoped for but, said Huq, CO2 had been given a price for the first time. Governments around the world are now thinking about implementing taxes on CO2, and several already have. Sweden charges the highest price for fossil fuel emissions, at \u20ac114 a ton. For renewable energy , the treaty was a \"game changer,\" said Karsten Neuhoff, head of climate policy at the German Institute for Economic Research. \"In 2007, everyone was still saying that generating 20% of energy in Europe from renewables in 2020 would be utopian. Today it is reality.\" \"Kyoto is not solely responsible for investments in the energy transition, but it was an important stimulus,\" said Neuhoff. Kyoto's weaknesses and the road to the Paris climate agreement Experts say the major weakness of the Kyoto Protocol was that developing countries did not commit themselves to climate targets. The economies of countries such as China, India and Indonesia grew rapidly in the following years \u2014 and so did their greenhouse gas emissions. Today, more than half of the world's emissions come from developing and emerging economies . \"We don't do enough to tackle the problem at the global level,\" said Huq. \"And so we all have to collectively do more.\" A steep fall in solar and wind energy prices has made the switch to renewable energy in middle-income countries easier In principle, industrialized countries still have obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, but a later treaty, the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, has now superseded it. Under the Paris Agreement , all countries of the world agreed to reduce global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0above pre-industrial levels. The signatories committed themselves to national climate and CO2 reduction targets that they themselves came up with. But so far, hardly any country has met its targets. Global greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 41%\u00a0since 1990 and continue to rise. If CO2 emissions continue at current levels, the earth will warm up by about 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. \"The consensus principle has failed,\" said Ott. \"Fossil fuel states such as Saudi Arabia, the US, Russia and Australia are blocking any real action. Therefore a new treaty is needed \u2014 a fast lane for those states that really have an interest in climate protection.\" Our dependence on air-conditioning is probably one of the most ironic climate change feedback loops we have created: As temperatures rise, we turn up our ACs, which generate more emissions, which leads to warmer temperatures, and so on. Scientists are busy figuring out how to create cool air without electricity. If they succeed, it could hopefully be a game-changer. Much has been said abut the green credentials of electric cars. But are they really squeaky clean? While they still produce lower CO2 emissions when actually on the road, they're really only as green as their power source. And the production of electric vehicles is energy intensive because of the complex batteries required to run them. From the Great Barrier Reef to retreating glaciers: In response to the effects of climate change, more and more people are opting to visit World Heritage Sites and other fragile parts of the world while they still can. Although 'last chance' tourism can help raise awareness of environmental issues, flight emissions and stress on local resources often makes the situation even worse. Even if you choose not to travel, simply staying at home doesn't mean you aren't contributing to carbon emissions. Experts have calculated that the world's digital footprint has now exceeded that of the aviation industry. The more data we send and store, the more electricity we need. And with billions of people online regularly, those emissions add up very quickly. More people than ever are switching to a plant-based diet for the sake of the environment. But not all non-animal products are eco-friendly. The soaring popularity of avocados, for example, has led farmers to cut down precious woodlands to keep up with demand, while the production of almond milk requires the diversion of huge amounts of water in drought-prone regions. We're constantly being encouraged to invest in the latest eco-friendly products. But the truth is, you'd be helping the planet far more by not buying anything in the first place. Because any new product \u2014 no matter how 'green' \u2014 still requires resources to make. Of course, some products require fewer resources than others. But ultimately, the less stuff we buy, the better. Rising need for fresh water paired with a drier climate in many parts of the world has increased the demand for desalination plants. Unfortunately, removing salt from the water creates a toxic brine by-product, which can severely damage ecosystems if not properly treated. Although technological innovations are helping make this process more environmentally friendly, it's still not without risk.

{"id": null, "body": "     For the first time, the German government is being taken to court for failing to protect the climate. Ahead of the hearing, DW spoke to one of the plaintiffs in the case, organic farmer Silke Backsen. A legal case against the German government over climate change came before the Berlin Administrative Court Thursday. The action was filed in autumn 2018 by the environmental organization Greenpeace, along with three German families who say global warming is threatening their livelihoods. The plaintiff families, who are all organic farmers directly affected by changing weather patterns, are accusing the government of not complying with its climate protection targets for 2020. They say this amounts to an infringement of their constitutional rights. The plaintiffs are hoping the court will compel the German government to take effective action in order to meet the targets.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0 German environment minister says government must act on climate now One of the plaintiffs is Silke Backsen, who runs an organic farm on the island of Pellworm off German's North-Frisian\u00a0coastline. She's worried about what will happen to her home when sea levels rise .\u00a0She spoke to DW ahead of the court hearing on Thursday.\u00a0 Silke Backsen runs an organic farm on the German island of Pellworm DW: What led you to bring this case against the German government? Silke Backsen: The weather over the 2017-2018 period played a big role. We went from a total monsoon in 2017 to an extremely dry phase. The drought summer of 2018 affected a lot of people. But that's essentially just weather. Actual climate change is much harder to recognize, I think, because it's a slow, ongoing process. But as temperatures rise, it's becoming increasingly difficult to farm in the way we do. Where we live, we are profoundly affected by rising sea levels \u2014\u00a0and will be continue to be in the future. Ultimately, those of us who live in this region are wondering what will happen when\u00a0sea levels rise as they're predicted to. Read more:\u00a0 Hotter, higher seas to worsen extreme floods without 'urgent and ambitious' action, United Nations warns Can you tell us more about how your farm is affected? We have cattle, we raise and fatten them and breed both males and females. We also have sheep and quite a lot of cropland. I can tell you about the concrete effects of the extreme weather in 2017-18. The fields were flooded. And on Pellworm, the island where we live, that implied drainage problems \u2014\u00a0because we couldn't get rid of the water.\u00a0 Straight after that we had an extremely dry period, which left\u00a0our grazing land completely useless.\u00a0Not enough grass was growing on our pastures to feed the bulls and cattle. And generally we've noticed a rise in extreme weather. It's becoming harder and harder for farmers , especially organic farmers, to work on these complex marshlands. Many German farmers felt the destructive power of the 2018 drought In many places along the coast of Schleswig-Holstein, the dikes are being raised to keep rising sea leves at bay How have people responded to your decision to sue the government? At first people were quite reserved about it. We'd been looking into the issue for a long time before we felt ready to file this legal case, along with other families. Then we realized that there was a huge need for more education on the topic. And actually then it completely changed and we got a lot of support. The issue seemed to really resonate with a lot of people, it was being discussed in committee meetings, at home, among families and friends,\u00a0and also by local politicians here. Now we're taken much more seriously and have a lot of support. Read more :\u00a0 Germany's coastal lowlands under the shadow of climate change Do you feel encouraged by movements like Fridays for Future? Yes, when we filed the claim last October, it was around the same time that Fridays for Future was gaining a lot of momentum. I think movements like this give each other strength. It's important to apply pressure on many levels, and to give a clear signal that many people are really waking up to this issue and saying: 'We've had enough, things can't go on like this. You can't ignore 1.4 million people on the streets \u2014\u00a0and actually you can't ignore a lawsuit like ours either.'\u00a0 A farm in Germany ploughed a message into its corn field Have there also been negative reactions? Yes, we've experienced that too. That's normal when you put yourself out there like we have. And of course, as farming families, we're both victims and perpetrators. The agricultural sector is of course guilty, in inverted commas, of many things when it comes to the environment. If you're a cattle farmer, some people are obviously going to find it completely ridiculous when you say: \"We want to do something against climate change.\u201d But in the end, it depends how you run your farm \u2014\u00a0and we see huge differences between conventional farming and organic farming. Read more:\u00a0 Does Germany's weak climate plan reflect a polarized public? Where have you come up against resistance? Close to home actually. In our small community, or even among close friends, there were people who didn't understand why we were taking the German government to court; why we would take such a serious step in order to bring the issue to peoples' attention or in order to try and make sure we actually achieve the 2020 climate targets. But we also didn't spend a lot of time discussing it with people before we decided to take this step and file the lawsuit. Not everyone has to support the thing we're personally so passionate about. But that has really changed over time. What do you expect from the court proceedings? We're not lawyers so it's hard for us to make any real predictions about who will \"win\u201d or \"lose\u201d the case, but since last October, we've done an unbelievable amount of work on the issue, to publicize it, to show the concrete ways in which individuals are affected, to show that this is not just an abstract problem happening somewhere else in the world, but that it\u00a0affects your neighbors and it affects all of us. In the best case, of course, we would win\u00a0and the government would be compelled to reach its climate targets.\u00a0 The island of Pellworm is below sea-level and at risk from rising waters \"There is a huge problem with brown coal\" If that does happen, what steps do you see being taken \u2013 or what steps would you like to see the government take? I think it's clear to everyone what this is about and which government departments need to take strong steps at the very least in order to reach the climate goals. There is a huge problem with transport. There is a huge problem with brown coal; in the coal mining sector; in the energy sector. We should have had a major change there a long time ago. And on all levels, we need to finally get some guidelines in place that citizens have to stick to or that make it easier for us to live in a way that produces less CO2. That's obvious. I don't want to tell the government what precise steps it should be taking \u2014\u00a0it has its own experts for that. But they have to start doing more. Read more:\u00a0 Survey: Most Germans want climate protection, but not protests So you'd like to see more regulations? That's a word many people don't like to hear. But I don't think it's enough for us to keep saying that everyone has to individually make changes to their lives. It's extremely important that every small change can make a difference. But to make bigger changes, we need politics \u2014\u00a0that's what it's there for. As a child, I never did up my seatbelt; we all rolled about on the back seat of the car. But now it's the law to wear a seatbelt and it's for my own safety. Measures put in place to combat climate change are also for my own safety. Will we manage to stop global warming in the future? Are you optimistic or pessimistic about that? I'm always optimistic. I'm an optimistic person and I would say we can do it. We will do it. At the end of the day, we all have to shift our thinking and realize that it can't go on like this. Talk about it with everyone you can. Take action. Let's go! We can definitely turn this around. The interview was conducted by  Mabel Gundlach and has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0 Although there is a combination of factors behind the numerous jellyfish that reach vacation havens like the Mediterranean coast, climate change is also partially to blame. Warmer sea temperatures are opening up new areas where jellyfish can reproduce, and increasing the availability of their favorite food: plankton. Prized for their superior sound quality, an original Stradivarius can sell for millions of dollars. Yet, extreme weather events, such as unusually violent storms, are killing millions of trees, putting at risk the famous wood in the Paneveggio forest, in northern Italy. Replanting trees won't help much in the short term. A spruce has to be at least 150 years old before it can become a violin. On very hot nights, people sleep worse, especially in big cities. By 2050 European metropolises may experience temperatures around 3.5 degrees Celsius warmer in summer. It not only affects sleep, but also mood, productivity and mental health. The only way to escape is to move to smaller towns and settlements, where the nights are cooler since there are fewer buildings and more greenery. Spring is starting earlier in the year due to global warmer temperatures \u2014 bad news for allergy sufferers. With a longer frost-free season, plants have more time to grow, bloom and produce pollen. Therefore, pollen will freely roam around much earlier, which will make the suffering season longer and the annual pollen load greater. Will it be the century of masks for air pollution and allergies? Heat not only makes us sweat; it also affects our health. By the end of this century three-quarters of the world's population is expected to be exposed to dangerous and deadly heat waves. Rising temperatures mean an increase in diarrheal diseases, as it's easier for bacteria to multiply in warm food and water. Mosquito numbers will also likely go up, along with the spread of diseases like malaria. Soil in the region around the North Pole is increasingly thawing in the summer months, with dramatic local and global consequences. Warmer temperatures cause floors to become unstable and houses and roads to crack, and leads to many more insects. Moreover, if permafrost \u2014 frozen soil \u2014 melts, it will release CO2 and methane gases that could further exacerbate global warming. It's a vicious circle. Temperature can influence the sex of several species. For sea turtles, the heat of the sand where the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the newborn. Low temperatures benefit male turtles, while females develop better in warmer areas. Researchers have found that over 99% of turtle hatchlings in northern Australia are already female, making it difficult for the species to survive. Author: Gero Rueter, Irene Banos Ruiz The German government has rejected claims that several elements of its proposed climate change law had been scaled back. Critics say the original bill was already too weak to allow Germany to reach global climate goals.

Yohan Didier wants to grow corals in Mauritius In Kerala, where Aravind comes from, heavy flooding killed more than 320 people last year. While her family was not affected by the disaster because their house is built on top of a hill, some of her friends were forced to spend days on their roofs before they could be rescued. \"The monsoon is very, very strange in recent years,\" she told DW. \"It's coming irregularly and when it rains, it's extreme. There could always be landslides.\" Yohan Didier comes from the small island of Mauritius , where around 60 to 70 percent of local coral has died over the past few years. \" Corals are extremely sensitive if the temperature of the water changes just about one or two degrees,\" he says. \"The past year was extremely hot, so when I go diving, I see more and more bleached corals.\" Didier's role model is the scientist David Vaughan, who accidentally discovered that when coral is broken into little pieces, it only takes three years for it to reproduce, instead of the typical 75 years. Vaughan wants to scatter millions of pieces of farmed coral into the sea off the coast of Florida over the next few years. Didier hopes to do the same thing in Mauritius. After three-and-a-half hours, the crane pulls the deep-sea gauge out of the water and the ship resumes its journey at 14 knots. It will take two more measuring stations \u2014 around six days \u2014 before the vessel docks in Bremerhaven.

There are dark days, too, but the crew has to work whatever the conditions. Before entering the work deck, each crew member has to put on a lifejacket and a helmet. The aim of the expedition is to find out more about our changing climate. The crew takes water samples for analysis. They take a sample from the ocean with a bucket. The water is filled into canisters. Then it gets filtered before it's taken to the lab. The scientists analyze the water samples for pigments like chlorophyll in several labs on board. They're curious what the results of these tests will show.

{"id": null, "body": "     Humans have long been driven by a desire to explore the planet and visit faraway places. But with tourism's toll on the environment now calling our globetrotting habits into question, some say it's time for change. The rise of social media has changed the way many people think about tourism Tourism accounts for roughly 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and it's a sector that is projected to keep growing. That's a big concern for Richard Sharpley, professor of tourism and development at the University of Central Lancashire in the UK. He has been intrigued by the meaning of tourism and why we as humans feel compelled to travel since he went on a backpacking trip around Asia in the mid-1980s. That was a different time. Social media didn't exist, there were few low-cost airlines, and there was no Fridays for Future movement raising awareness about the emissions from flights , for example.\u00a0 DW's environment podcast \"On the Green Fence\" spoke to him about what motivates people to travel, and whether growing concerns about climate change could eventually lead to a shift in our behavior as tourists. DW : Going on holiday is something that many people in the Global North are used to doing every year. Why is traveling something that we feel compelled to do? Richard Sharpley: It's a really interesting question, and I think it's one that nobody's really been able to find a definitive answer to yet. Richard Sharpley says we should reduce how often we travel to help the planet In the early days of what became mass tourism, the key drivers have always been money, time and technology. In other words, as soon as we've had the ability to travel, and the means to do so through trains, planes, cars, we have done so. There's an intrinsic desire amongst most people to explore our planet. There's this sense in modern society that somehow we will find a better existence, we'll find ourselves, we'll find something different or we'll find happiness by going on holiday. In a sense I think we've almost been conditioned to become tourists, to engage in tourism during the year at particular times, to the extent that I think a lot of people engage in tourism without actually considering why they're doing so. There's also this aspect that we all strive to be as cosmopolitan as possible, right? So in a way, in some circles, if you haven't been to certain places, you almost have the reputation that you haven't \"lived.\" How strong a role does that play, do you think? I think that varies. There are plenty of people who will go to the same place every year, year on year, because they're comfortable and familiar with it. To them, tourism is a means of relaxation. On the other hand, there are increasing numbers of people, I believe \u2014 and it's manifested in the increasing popularity of the so-called bucket list \u2014 for whom collecting places is part of identity formation. It becomes one aspect of how people see themselves and identify themselves against others. These are the people who accidentally let their passport pages be visible at the airport so you can see all the stamps in it. It's a superiority thing if you've traveled more than anybody else. Participation in tourism is becoming an increasingly complex sociological phenomenon because it's part of identity, it's part of leisure. And in this era of social media, that kind of identity role has been enhanced. It's never been easier to reach distant places, but how we get there and how we behave will determine our travel footprint I think the ability to go on social media through Instagram or Facebook or whatever it is and tell people and share your experiences is a key driver of tourism. It's not a concern as such, but what it is doing is transforming the nature of the tourist experience in a negative sense. In my view, people are experiencing less and less the places they are at. They might be there in body, but not necessarily in mind, because a lot of people are constantly thinking: \"How am I going to present myself to my social media group back home through my posts on Facebook or Instagram?\" Would you say that awareness about the environment or sustainability is changing the way we travel? The short answer is no. This is the great challenge for the future of tourism within the context of global warming in particular: can we change the way we travel? My belief is we need to reduce the amount we travel. A lot of research has been done into the extent to which tourists are willing to adapt their behavior. And even those people who regularly consume or behave in an environmentally friendly fashion \u2014 whether it's what they buy, whether they recycle or whatever it might be \u2014 research has found that they actually temporarily forget their environmental credentials, that they behave like normal tourists. They do suffer some kind of ecoguilt, but nevertheless they continue to travel, they continue to fly. Travel is now seen as a right, not as a privilege. It's long been my view that the only way to achieve any kind of change in behavior will be through regulation and pricing. What kind of regulation do you envisage? I certainly do envisage a significant rise in the cost of air travel, and it becoming more of a luxury again in the future. I'm old enough to remember when tourism was just the summer holiday, and you would look forward to those two weeks a year when you would go on holiday. It was distinctive, it was special, it was meaningful. Whereas nowadays it is so easy to travel. When you can travel all the time, in my view at least, it loses the excitement. It loses its meaning. I've used the term \"obesity of experience,\" and\u00a0I think, particularly in Europe and elsewhere, we are becoming obese on experiences. I think people will eventually begin to realize that to enjoy tourism, let's do a bit less and really savor it when we do travel. Flying is one of the most carbon-intensive ways to travel The Spanish city of Barcelona draws millions of tourists each year, most of which arrive by plane Some critics,\u00a0for example a very liberally minded, globalized person who thinks that the market regulates all and everything will be fine, they might say this\u00a0sounds like a socialist police state that's bordering on an eco-dictatorship. What do you say to them? I completely understand that. Up to a point I'm as in favor of a neoliberal democratic country economy where everybody has freedoms to do what they want to do, to be who they want to be and spend what they want to spend. Certainly, in the developed world, we've all benefited very heavily from that. Tourism is just one of many, many things we consume on a regular basis that we enjoy. And it's all part of this growth-based neoliberal economy, which is understood as driving progress, development, happiness and so on. There are numerous destinations, societies, countries around the world which are entirely dependent upon tourism. Arguably, we need to overall consume less to achieve this balance across the world to achieve equity and justice. And certainly tourism is one thing where there is no justice and no equity, because it is environmentally a very destructive activity enjoyed by a relatively small proportion of the global population. What about younger generations, who might resent the fact that they're being asked to travel less while their parents had the chance to go everywhere they wanted. Do you see any sort of rifts within society over this? I fully recognize that that's one of the major issues. Of course, it's very much based on the argument that young people's parents \u2014 my generation and my parents' generation \u2014 have enjoyed very rapid improvements in our standard of living. But at the same time, we're the generations who, through that creation of wealth and enjoying ourselves so much, have actually underpinned the destruction of the global environment. And yes, undoubtedly there will be resentment on the part of younger generations who might believe their freedoms and opportunities have been curtailed through the activities of the older generation. But I think they are also sufficiently aware to realize that if they were to continue in the way that earlier generations have behaved, then they won't have a world to live in.

{"id": null, "body": "     The past couple of years will likely go down in history as the ones when climate change really hit. They could also be remembered as the ones in which people worked to stop it. DW looks at some civil society victories. Eucador's Waorani indigenous people celebrated a court ruling against oil extraction on heir ancestral lands Alarming headlines regarding the climate crisis often overshadow positive actions taken by citizens around the world , but that doesn't mean they're not happening. They are,\u00a0and sometimes with considerable success. DW looks at some civil society victories. I.\u00a0Blocking fossil fuels Despite scientific warnings, governments and companies continue to green light fossil fuel projects\u00a0around the world. But in many instances, these authorizations are accompanied by protests. 1. Hema thermal power plant Earlier this year, after more than a decade of vocal opposition to the planned Hema thermal power plant, villagers in the coastal Turkish region of Amasra\u00a0welcomed a court ruling that rejected its construction. Locals had not only feared the destruction of their land, but also the impacts on their health and that of their children.\u00a0 Amasra villagers have been protesting for years to prevent the construction of a power plant The\u00a0win is a milestone for Turkish climate activists, whose struggle to stop the expansion of fossil fuel plants in the country still has a long way to go. 2. Rocky Hill open-cut mine Locals around the Australian town of Gloucester experienced similar satisfaction when a national court rejected a plan to build the Rocky Hill open-cut coal mine on the basis that it would increase greenhouse gas emissions at a time when they needed to be reduced. It took those involved in fighting the plans about a decade to achieve success. It took protesters a decade to fight plans of an open-cut coal mine The judge said the negative impacts outweighed its economic and public benefits. Australia is the fourth largest coal producer in the world. 3. Hambach Forest Germany has become the setting for one of the most iconic fights against coal mining in Europe . Hundreds of people have spent five years living in tree houses in a bit to prevent a tiny fraction of the Hambach forest in North Rhine-Westphalia from being razed for the expansion of a nearby open-pit coal mine that has already devoured dozens of villages and 90% of the forest. Protesters built a camp with tents and tree houses to stop the clearing of Hambacher Forest In 2018, the anti-coal movement brought together thousands of people in Germany's biggest climate march. A few months later, authorities agreed on a moratorium on logging . Only until 2020, however, so theirs is a bittersweet victory. 4. Divesting money More and more people are demanding that investors, such as faith-based organizations and pension funds, withdraw their financial support from fossil fuel projects. The global divestment movement has convinced over 1,000 institutions\u00a0to commit to divesting from oil, coal and gas companies. This translates to almost $8 trillion (\u20ac7 trillion) less in assets from fossil fuel investments. \"The momentum has been driven by a people-powered grassroots movement, ordinary people on every continent pushing their local institutions to take a stand against the fossil fuel industry and for a world powered by 100% renewable energy,\" the NGO 350.org says. II.\u00a0Thousands coming together Climate protests have long been a niche for dedicated eco warriors, but this year, they've become increasingly mainstream.\u00a0 1. Fridays for Future Kids who go on strike\u00a0to protect their future are\u00a0becoming the new normal.\u00a0The Fridays for Future\u00a0movement has managed to capture everyone's attention \u2014\u00a0in a way that not even the iconic images of starving polar bears achieved. Students in Berlin tell world leaders during a Fridays for Future protest: 'Our future [is] in your hands' It all began with Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg skipping school on Fridays to take a lone stand outside her country's parliament. That singular action has since spurred hundreds of thousands of young people worldwide to participate in Friday school strikes calling for decisive climate action. 2. Extinction Rebellion In early 2019,\u00a0a\u00a0 mass civil disobedience campaign emerged on the streets of London. The protest group, which includes members of all ages and walks of life, occupied iconic sites in the English capital and saw some of its number strip off inside parliament. A week of disruptive actions in April led to the arrest of more than 1,000 people, but it also scored the group considerable global attention. The movement has since expanded to more than 30 countries. Beginning April 15, protesters with Extinction Rebellion took to the streets of London and other cities to demand governments declare a climate and ecological emergency. They occupied key spots in the city, calling on those in charge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and set up citizens' assemblies on climate and ecological justice. Extinction Rebellion, founded last year by academics in the United Kingdom, is one of the world's fastest-growing environmental movements. Their aim is to protest climate change inaction in a creative and nonviolent way. Demonstrators say people are causing their own mass extinction, which is the basis of their \"rebellion.\" Harry and Meghan, the duke and duchess of Sussex, didn't exactly take part in the sit-in on London's Waterloo Bridge on April 18. The royals are expecting and protesters used the happy event in their demonstration, having the couple \"thank\" Extinction Rebellion for saving their child's future. Activists have used a variety of unusual protest methods to draw maximum attention and get their point across. Throughout the week, they've blocked traffic, climbed atop buses and superglued themselves to buildings and, in the case of this young man at London's Canary Wharf station on April 17, trains. The goal of the protests is to temporarily disrupt everyday life. As a result, police have arrested more than 800 people in London alone. Activists want to get the public on their side, but a YouGov survey showed that just 36% of more than 3,500 British polled support the protest, with 52% against. Extinction Rebellion protesters first attracted global attention on April 1, during yet another heated Brexit debate in the British Parliament. A group of semi-naked activists revealed themselves in the visitor gallery with slogans including \"SOS\" and \"Stop Wasting Time\" written on their bodies, with some gluing their hands to a glass barrier. The scene was quickly broken up my security. The Extinction Rebellion protests got their start in London, but the movement has also spread to other major cities around the world. On April 15, these activists on the Oberbaum Bridge in Berlin blocked traffic for hours. On April 21, organizers in London said they were willing to switch tactics and talk with the government. \"We're giving them an opportunity now to come and speak to us,\" said spokesman James Fox. \"If they refuse \u2026 then this is going to continue and this going to escalate in different, diverse and very creative ways.\" Author: Friedel Taube 3. We Are Still In US President Donald Trump's intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement came as a shock, but US American civil society quickly recovered . They gathered strength and created the We Are Still In coalition. Since then, the group has tripled in size and now totals over 3,500 institutions, including local governments, faith communities, businesses and universities. The group has generated hundreds of climate commitments, businesses have pledged to meet climate targets and over 100 US cities have committed to switching to 100% percent renewable energy. III. The climate crisis goes to court Globally, more than a thousand court cases are demanding governments and polluters comply with laws to protect citizens. Some have already achieved success. 1. The Urgenda case In 2015, a group of Dutch citizens decided to hold their government accountable for contributing to climate change. In a landmark ruling, a court in the Hague ordered the Netherlands government to cut greenhouse-gas emissions in the country by at least 25% within five years. However, the Dutch government appealed the decision and a final decision is now expected from the Netherlands' Supreme Court. Whatever happens,\u00a0the Urgenda case is seen by many as the climate's greatest legal milestone. It has inspired lawsuits across the world.. 2. Waorani against oil Earlier this year, Ecuador's Waorani indigenous people celebrated a court ruling that suspends the sale of the community's territory in the remote Amazon for the pursuit of oil extraction. The result came after more than five years of opposition from the indigenous group. This victory could also mark a turning point for other indigenous communities struggling to defend their land rights and oppose oil exploration. Greta Thunberg, \"Fridays for Future,\" and a popular YouTuber pushed climate change to the top of the European elections agenda in Germany. The young voted in droves and want to change more than the political landscape. (27.05.2019)\n\u00a0 The European Parliament elections clearly showed that Germany's young people want their voice to be heard. Observers say a new political generation is rising, with new ways of sharing its thoughts and priorities. (08.06.2019)\n\u00a0 Basketball, ice climbing, swimming and surfing \u2014 professional athletes are using their popularity to shed light on climate change and encourage others to do more to protect our environment.

{"id": null, "body": "     After COP24, there are big questions remaining about the global response to climate change. DW spoke with Li Shuo, who coordinated Greenpeace's engagement on the UN climate negotiations, about China's important role. What is the leading narrative on China's climate action? The truth is never black or white . You see on the one hand\u00a0that China is the biggest developer of new energy. On the other hand China is investing in fossil fuel infrastructure all over the world . The science is clear, we have 12 years to cut back global greenhouse gas emissions .\u00a0 That does not allow any more space for coal-fired power plants. The Chinese government needs to hear that message and needs to reverse its course on the Belt and Road initiative in terms of fossil fuel infrastructure investment. Li Shuo is senior climate and energy policy officer at Greenpeace China Are there climate skeptics in the Chinese government, as in the US? I think whether they believe it or not, climate science is abundantly clear. We need to get global greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2030 or the middle of the century. In many other countries, the climate issue is a political issue. But in China it is not a polarized issue. We don't need to start a climate conversation from science 101 [basic science]. So that is very different from the US situation. I think the Chinese decision makers understand the science very clearly, and there is no one that would be considered seriously if they were questioning or doubting climate science bodies. Read more: \u00a0 World reacts to US withdrawal from Paris agreement The sustainable driving force that I see in the next few years or decades in order for China to continue and double down on climate action is actually domestic interest. It is abundantly clear that we need to gradually shift away from our coal dependence. It has already generated tremendous air pollution and has huge implications for water. For its own interest China should continue developing climate action. Is there a \"coal culture\" in China? Regarding coal culture, it is similar to West Virginia in the US \u2013 we have our West Virginias in China, we have our Polands in China. This is in the middle part of the country, where the local economy heavily depends on coal mining and there are generations and generations of coal miners concentrated there. Workers at a coal mine in Shanxi province How would \"coal culture\" affect the removal of fossil fuel from China's energy profile? I think those communities gradually realize that coal is not the future, although coal consumption has been growing by double digits over the past two decades. However, we have hit the tipping point already and coal consumption is plateauing and as a result of that, there is less demand for coal mining. So a lot of those communities are now suffering. Where does the role of Chinese civil society come in? With lack of transparency, how can a climate-friendly message be communicated to communities that depend on coal? I think the market is already conveying that message \u2013 that the country doesn't need that much coal and that it drives the price down. A lot of those communities are suffering economically. So they realize that it is not sustainable in the long run to rely just on coal mining. A lot of those communities are trying to diversify. It is not an easy process, but I think a lot of them are embarking on a transition away from coal. Read more:\u00a0 Asia faces tough contradictions in dealing with climate change Did China play a constructive role this year at COP24? I think the rule book will never be finalized without China's support. The underlying politics behind the rule book is the politics of differentiation and flexibility. I think it is a huge step forward that we now have a solid rule book, with common rules, transparency and review. That is a huge step forward from the current climate regime that we have. So it is a valuable achievement in the current turbulent geopolitical field. I think we should give them and all the countries that participated in [the recent COP24 in Poland] negotiations credit. However, I think on the other hand we need to realize that we have a fundamental ambition deficit. Again, we are heading for a 3.4 degree warmer world and even if we only see a 1.5 degree rise, it will have serious consequences . The lead of China's climate delegation, Xie Zhenhua, speaks to reporters at COP24 in Katowice, Poland What would the consequences be for China with temperature rise? If we shoot up to 2 degrees, that means that all the glaciers in the western part of China will be gone. It is as simple and as dramatic as that, and I don't think a situation like that is in China's interest. So it is imperative for China and all the other countries to take climate action. Read more: \u00a0 How China's climate revolution can stop global warming The outcome from here is not sufficient in our view. I think all the countries should go home, do their homework and prepare to announce their highest ambitions next year in September at the UN Secretary General's climate summit. Li Shuo is Senior Climate and Energy Policy Officer at Greenpeace China. He covers air pollution, water scarcity, and monitors key energy policies for the organization. Internationally, Li Shuo coordinates Greenpeace's engagement on the UN climate negotiation (UNFCCC). This interview was conducted by Wesley Rahn at COP24 in Katowice, Poland. China's CO2 emissions decreased steadily from 2014 to 2016, a new study finds. Great news, right? Well, sort of. According to the researchers, the trend could be permanent.

{"id": null, "body": "     As part of efforts to combat climate change, a majority of Germans say they're in favor of scaling down or completely abandoning their Christmas lights this year, according to a new survey. A majority of Germans say they would consider scaling down their Christmas lights to protect the climate, a survey released on Sunday said. A total of 57% of those surveyed said they would reduce Christmas lighting or even do without it in the future, according to the survey conducted by YouGov on behalf of the German\u00a0news agency DPA.\u00a0\u00a0 Of the respondents, 11%\u00a0said they would make do without any lights this year due to climate concerns, while 10% said they would do so in the future.

Having lights up during the festive season is appreciated by a large majority of 79% in Germany. Almost seven out of 10 people surveyed plan to decorate their homes with electric Christmas lights this year. This year again, the Christmas Garden opens during the Advent season in Berlin with countless lights. Under the theme \"The magical journey begins at dusk\" it takes visitors through the illuminated Botanical Garden. On their quest for the light of Christmas, they follow the dark paths into the magic garden. In the Christmas Garden, there are small and large light installations, with entire landscapes or individual Christmas motifs that illuminate the cold winter nights. In this place, poinsettias reflect their light on the surface of a small lake. They seem to float in the air and show visitors the way through the dark park. Many installations in the Christmas Garden change, vary in colour, alternate between light and darkness and thus with changing light sources bring the garden to life. Each individual installation is accompanied by music. Particularly impressive is the spectacle here on the meadow, where thousands of lights dance to the beat of the music. Not all paths and places are illuminated. Between the different stages, visitors walk through darkness. Therefore, the individual stages are all the more striking like this pavilion. They provide orientation and tempt visitors to linger. After that, the journey continues through the night to the next island of illumination. Moon and stars accompany visitors on their way through the Botanical Garden. Not only the real celestial bodies, but also light installations that transform the treetops into their own version of the night sky. Brightly lit ladders lead up to the tree trunks. Here the stars are literally within reach. The magical journey through the Christmas Garden also leads past these glittering animal sculptures. Blue swans and white ravens transform the darkest parts of the park into magical places. They look like mythical creatures and transport visitors into another world. As the German Christmas song says: \"Sweeter the bells never did ring...\" when a hundred little bells in changing colors break the silence. At this stage, visitors walk through a downpour of bells, seeing nothing but colorful lights to the left and right. With every movement they bring the magic of Christmas to life and let the bells ring. Golden trees, shining branches \u2014 more than a million light sources put visitors in a festive mood. The oaks and beeches are transformed into weeping willows. Their branches are hung with long chains of lights through which you have to make your way in order to move forward. A glittering gate leads into a canopy of lights. The golden dots cut through the darkness. Numerous chains of lights encircle the tent. Those who walk through here do not remain mere observers of the installation, but rather feel like part of it. True to the motto \"The magical journey begins at dusk\", Scotland's most famous representative has also made a long journey to visit the Christmas Garden: Nessie, the Loch Ness monster brightly emerges from a dark lake and illuminates the surface of the water.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on the private sector to take up the \"Herculean task\" to combat climate change. Germany's governing coalition parties will meet Friday to discuss measures targeting the transportation sector to ensure the country meets its 2030 goals to combat climate change. Proposals call for tax breaks and subsidies to bolster electric car purchases, the construction of new cycle paths, improving public transportation, promoting alternative fuels\u00a0and overhauling the railway network , among other measures, to tackle the destabilization of Earth's climate system. Up to \u20ac75 billion ($83 billion) could be spent by 2030, according to a proposal from the Transport\u00a0Ministry seen by the Munich-based daily\u00a0 S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung \u00a0and the German dpa news agency.

Scheuer said it is arrogant to call for drastically increasing petrol and heating costs and banning\u00a0all cars from cities, saying it doesn't account for the various lifestyles that exist in Germany. He said he is against compulsory fees and tax increases. But the government appears divided on how to balance regulation, incentive programs and a tax on CO2 emissions . Make-or-break deal The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has made clear that a climate protection package could make-or-break its coalition deal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). \"If we fail to find a convincing solution, the government loses its legitimacy,\" said Finance Minister Olaf Scholz of the SPD. At a meeting with EU finance ministers on Friday, Scholz said member states needed to take \"drastic steps.\" One Greenpeace expert described government efforts as a \"bonus orgy,\" saying monetary incentives shouldn't be used to woo the private sector to comply with policies that tackle climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     Most of us do things every day that contribute to climate change, and changing our behavior is vital. But we won't get anywhere acting alone. And that's where you come in. \"Your individual actions are key to protecting our planet,\" could almost be a slogan for our century. That's why I don't have a car, only buy second-hand clothes, barely eat meat, recycle carefully and have even given up one of my favorite indulgences \u2014\u00a0chocolate cream made with palm oil. Being eco-friendly makes me feel good on\u00a0many levels \u2014 and, we all know, sounds cool. But let's be honest: Does it really make any meaningful difference to the planet? Or am I just soothing my own conscience as the world burns? Is there really anything we can do as individuals to tackle the global problem of climate change? Yes, your actions matter It's frustrating when your day-in-day-out efforts and sacrifices save fewer emissions than someone else's\u00a0single journey on a private jet. But big change starts with the dedicated actions of a few\u00a0\u2014 where would we be if early\u00a0suffragists\u00a0gave up their fight because others refused to engage? Of course, actions such as recycling are positive - but are they enough? \"Lots of young people come to me and ask, can I do something, does it matter what I do?\"\u00a0Erik Solheim,\u00a0executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, told DW .\u00a0 \"The answer is yes. No one else can change the world \u2014\u00a0you can change the world.\"\u00a0 Solheim says change\u00a0can happen\u00a0much faster than we think;\u00a0it's just a question of will. Scott Goodson, founding chief executive of the marketing agency StrawberryFrog, also believes movements start with individuals \u2014 and someone has to take the lead. Awareness of your own impact on the planet and the contribution each of us can make, feeds into the bigger\u00a0 fight against global warming. Many people still find it hard to relate to a problem on the scale of climate change, Goodson told DW. But\u00a0\"inspiring behavior\" can help them engage. Be part of a community And making a difference is only really possible when millions of people join forces. \"We are actually quite powerless as individuals,\"\u00a0Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org and author of \"The End of Nature,\" told DW . Climate change has taken on such worrying dimensions that noble actions at home are no longer enough, McKibben said.\u00a0 \"The only thing an individual can do that really matters is become a little bit less of an individual and join together with others in the movements that are big and broad enough to actually change government policy.\"\u00a0 The collective actions of indigenous peoples from around the world are a point in case.\u00a0 Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, coordinator of the Indigenous Women and Peoples Association of Chad, points out\u00a0that 20 years ago, indigenous peoples were not even mentioned in climate talks. At COP23 this year, their presence was crucial. This was the result of small individual and local actions in far-flung corners of the world cooperating to\u00a0make a global impact,\u00a0Ibrahim says.\u00a0 Demand political action This all sounds very inspiring. But there is another much more challenging step before real change happens \u2014 political change.\u00a0 If you feel frustrated because family members can't be bothered to recycle, how does it feel to learn the\u00a0EU is still granting subsidies to the fossil fuel industry? Sadhguru, an\u00a0Indian spiritual leader and ecologist, told DW says it\u00a0doesn't matter how much you do as an individual , or even as a group, if political leaders don't act. \"If you don't have a clear-cut policy and if the administration or the governments don't invest in this direction, [\u2026] there is never going to be a solution,\"\u00a0he said. As McKibben says, \"we need many people in the streets demanding action and pushing governments to move much, much\u00a0faster than they're currently contemplating.\" Paying more for organic food might ensure your own grocery budget doesn't support climate-harmful farming practices. But it doesn't stop big corporations polluting the planet. Taking individual responsibility is good for the climate, but individualism isn't. We need to think\u00a0as\u00a0communities, get together to put pressure on our governments, and create new social and economic paradigms. At least, that's my New Year's resolution. You just bought a fancy lamp? Make it cooler with efficient lightbulbs. This is one of the small actions that make a difference in the long-term - and let's be honest, it's not a big effort. Some LED bulbs consume up to 90 percent less than traditional ones. In cold or rainy countries, the task might be challenging - but these challenges are nothing compared to the worst consequences of climate change. Recycling has become normal behavior for thousands of people around the world. It definitely contributes to making a better world - but unfortunately, it is not enough. Worried about your clothes shrinking in hot water? Here another reason to keep washing with cold water: Since it avoids turning on the water heater, cold-water washing also produces less greenhouse gas emissions. Until you are ready to get rid of your car completely, you could move to a hybrid electric car. But beware: The electricity that powers it is probably still coming from dirty fossil fuels. Beef production is the largest driver of tropical deforestation worldwide, with soy production closely following - mainly to feed animals. The carbon footprint of a meat-based diet is almost double that of a vegetarian one. Even reducing the amount of meat you eat makes a difference. Renewable energies are the new trend - but we are still largely dependent on fossil fuels such as coal. In countries like Germany, you can choose your energy provider - among some that draw from renewable sources. Air travel is a major challenge when it comes to tackling climate change. Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study. But if you start now with the other nine actions, your kids might be able to live in a better world. Author: Irene Banos Ruiz Global warming isn't just an environmental problem \u2014 it will affect every aspect of human life. Our response has to be just a wide-reaching \u2014 and experts say people power can still save the planet.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change will bring some surprising effects: Bumpy plane rides, greater mood swings and more volcanic eruptions are just a few of the things we can expect over the decades to come. And yes, even more lightning. We're already familiar with some of the more evident\u00a0effects of global warming\u00a0such as melting glaciers and more extreme weather events . But few people are aware of some of the other, less obvious - and completely surprising - impacts of our changing climate, which could have a serious impact on the way we live.\u00a0 1. Airplane turbulence will get worse\u00a0 Unfortunately, we can expect air travel to become even more stressful - thanks to the effects of climate change. A recent study by researchers at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom looks into the relationship between clean-air turbulence and anthropogenic climate change. Using the popular flight corridor between Europe and the United States as an example, they examined various strengths of turbulence and how each will change in the future if carbon dioxide levels were to double. The results showed that severe turbulence is likely to dramatically increase by up to 149 percent as a result of stronger wind shears within the Earth's jet streams. These are narrow, fast-flowing, meandering westerly currents found near the tropopause, which are frequently used by commercial airlines as a means of saving time and fuel. 2. Icebergs will clog up\u00a0shipping lanes\u00a0 No ship has been struck by an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean since the Titanic sunk in 1912 and\u00a0the International Ice Patrol was subsequently\u00a0formed. But patrol workers are likely going to get a lot busier soon.\u00a0 In early April, more than 400 icebergs clogged up\u00a0shipping lanes in the North Atlantic, forcing ships to take detours of up to 400 nautical miles - wasting significant time and fuel in the process. While icebergs are common in these waters, their number and timing is unusual. Experts say climate change could be to blame. The icebergs begin their journey after breaking off a glacier in Greenland, which is influenced largely by winter weather, especially storms accompanied by strong winds. Rising temperatures also lead to the melting of ice sheets, causing more chunks of ice to break off and float into the open ocean. 3. Lightning will strike more frequently\u00a0 Heat energy acts as a form of fuel for storm clouds. So as global temperatures continue to rise, we can also expect more active\u00a0thunderstorms. Although there are a number of downsides to this phenomenon - including a probable increase in\u00a0wildfires -\u00a0lightning actually produces a powerful chemical reaction that can be\u00a0beneficial for Earth's\u00a0atmosphere. Lightning creates a\u00a0special form of a greenhouse gas called nitrogen oxide, which indirectly regulates other potentially harmful greenhouse gases, like ozone and methane.\u00a0 4. Volcanic activity could increase\u00a0 You would be forgiven for thinking that climate change and volcanic activity are completely unrelated phenomena. But the workings of our planet are\u00a0interconnected in suprising ways.\u00a0 In places like Iceland, volcanoes and glaciers have coexisted for thousands of years. However, as glaciers melt\u00a0due to rising temperatures, the pressure on the Earth's mantel decreases, which in turn increases magma amounts while reducing stress on a volcano's magma chambers. This leads to higher volcanic activity, along with\u00a0 the travel chaos that often follows . There is a historic precedent to this prediction:\u00a012,000 years ago, Iceland was covered by a glacier as thick as 2 kilometers. When that glacier abruptly melted due to a warming trend, a huge surge in volcanic activity followed. 5. We'll become angrier\u00a0 Even our mood isn't immune from climate change. Researchers in social psychology have long\u00a0highlighted the link between warmer climates and\u00a0higher levels of\u00a0impulsive behavior and even violence .\u00a0 This has been shown in regions closer to the equator - if global temperatures continue to rise as expected, we could also begin to see behavioral changes in areas further north.\u00a0 In addition to having to contend with warmer weather, there is also evidence that climate change will further fuel global conflict by adding stress on natural resources like food and water.\u00a0 6. The ocean\u00a0will get\u00a0darker\u00a0 We can expect our oceans to gradually become murkier as the effects of climate change become more apparent over time. While climate change is often associated with higher temperatures and drought, it is also expected to increase\u00a0annual rainfall in some areas of the world. This will create faster-flowing rivers, which in turn churns up more silt and debris before this water meets the ocean.\u00a0 This phenomenon has already been observed along the coast of Norway, where the ocean water has become increasingly darker due to an increase in\u00a0precipitation and melting snow. 7. Allergies will worsen\u00a0 As if getting angrier wasn't enough: If you're one of the many people who suffer from springtime allergies, you should probably start stockpiling your medication. Warmer temperatures also mean\u00a0longer and earlier blooming seasons for allergy-triggering plants like dandelions and ragweed. Pollen counts are likely to double over the next three decades in the United States - and\u00a0\"sneezing season\" will\u00a0also kick off in the future as soon as the first week of April.\u00a0 8. Animals will shrink This one may take a bit longer to become apparent - but the development of\u00a0smaller mammals has been a common evolutionary response to past global warming events. During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, around 50 million years ago, mammals were \"dwarfed\" after global temperatures rose 5\u00a0and 8 degrees Celsius. Like all examples of evolution, the reason for this shrinking comes down to basic survival: As nutrients become more scarce due to rising temperatures and drought, larger animals struggle more than their smaller counterparts to fulfill their nutritional needs. \u00a0 9. Desert soil may erode\u00a0 Believe it or not, deserts are actually teeming with life - also in the form of bacterial colonies. These colonies grow so large, in fact, that they form strong layers known as \"biocrusts\" that prevent soil erosion.\u00a0 But different kinds of bacteria thrive in different temperature ranges. So as the climate continues to change quickly, these bacteria could find it difficult to adapt. If desert soil could becomes more prone to erosion, it would not be fertile enough\u00a0to\u00a0support plants and feed animals.\u00a0 10. Ant behaviour will change\u00a0 Ants play a more important role in the planet's ecosystem than you may realize. In spite of their status as a pest, ants helps plants by controlling other insects, circulating vital\u00a0nutrients and turning over the soil, among other things.\u00a0 But ants appear to be ill-equipped to handle the rising tempertatures caused by climate change. A\u00a0study carried out at Harvard Forest in Massachusetts revealed a susceptibility of ants to even slight temperature increases, with the most important seed-dispersing species essentially shutting down and retreating to\u00a0their underground nests until conditions improved.\u00a0 Some 10,500 firefighters were called to tackle forest fires in California in 2015. They were unable to prevent 1,400 homes from destruction. The blaze was fueled by hot and dry weather - as a result of climate change. The polar bear has become a symbol of climate change, as its habitat is threatened by global warming. The Arctic predator hunts from ice sheets that are fast disappearing. As the ice retreats, they are unable to stalk their prey, and risk starvation. By 2050, scientists warn that the Arctic could be ice-free in summer. Just visible from the air is a little wood hut on the island of Spitzbergen in Norway. It is home to the Arctic research base where French and German scientists are studying climatic and atmospheric changes in the polar region, including the damage done to permafrost and glacier systems. A goat watches a mountain expedition on the Swiss Aletsch Glacier, a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was around a kilometer longer in 1860 than it is today. Due to global warming, the glacier is shrinking by up to 50 meters per year. With the rate of retreat increasing, scientists fear Europe's biggest glacier could disappear altogether. \u2026 the landscape looks peaceful, bathed in a mystical light. But the actual situation is far more unsettling. This aerial view shows Central Luzon in the Philippines, completely flooded after it was hit by a typhoon and heavy rain. People were drowned or buried under landslides, and half a million were forced to flee their homes. The country is hit by 20 typhoons each year. \u2026 escape is all that's left. The World Bank warns that if global warming continues unimpeded, another 100 million people will be under threat. Poor people in parts of Africa and South Asia are at particular risk. Drought and flooding threaten crops - leading to hunger, disease and high food prices. Climate change often hits children the hardest, through no fault of their own. Studies have found that economic problems exacerbated by drought can have profound social impacts, such as in an increase in child marriages, for example. Families may marry off their underage daughters earlier to have fewer mouths they have to feed. Elephants produce huge quantities of manure. At Munich's Hellabrunn Zoo in Germany, one local utility is turning their waste into electric power. Around 2,000 tons of biowaste provides enough power for a hundred homes. Could this be a model for an African school? In any case, climate change is forcing new ways of thinking in the search for green energy. The Rhine River is Europe's busiest waterway for shipping - but climate change is affecting business. Ongoing drought means shipping firms would be forced to use shorter vessels that can navigate shallower waters. If ships aren't able to set off, more goods have to be transported by road - which is more expensive. Healthy coral reefs are like a blooming garden. But global warming is bleaching the life out of them. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae, which are vital to their health. But as the water heats up, they expel the algae. If warmer water temperatures persist, a lack of nutrients calcifies the corals, which makes their color fade and causes the organisms to die. Global warming also has its benefits. In recent years, wine is being produced on Germany's northernmost island, Sylt. Ever more vineyards are being established at higher altitudes and further north - even Scandinavia now has some. Global warming also means earlier harvests and sweeter grapes.

{"id": null, "body": "     A decade ago, Germany was a pioneer in fighting climate change via the expansion of renewable energies. But now, like many G20 nations, its climate protection is stagnating as global emissions rise again. As greenhouse gas emissions increase, the Climate Change Performance Index 2019 shows that only a handful of nations have implemented strategies to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The annual report \u2014 published Monday at the COP24 climate summit in Katowice, Poland \u2014 tracks climate change performance in 56 countries and the EU. It comes on the heels of news that after CO2 emissions stabilized for three consecutive years, they are set to hit historic highs in 2018 .\u00a0 Germany, so often held up as a beacon in the climate change fight, comes in at a middling 27th position \u2014 five places below its spot\u00a0last year. \"Our climate change index shows that there is no lack of commitment to the Paris climate agreement \u2014 but there is still a lack of political will to implement concrete steps,\" said Jan Burck from Germanwatch, an environmental organization that co-authored the report with the NewClimate Institute and Climate Action Network. \"There are no excuses for this, as all solutions are on the table and are also affordable,\" Burck added. While the IPCC and the United Nations Environment Program have warned that carbon emissions must fall rapidly if warming is to be kept below 2 degrees, year-on-year global CO2 emissions increased 1.6 percent in 2017. Tricky picture for climate protection The first three places in the ranking were again kept free by the authors since no country has done enough to keep temperature rises well below 2 degrees. Read more :\u00a0 Who fights hardest for the climate? The top ranked nation was again Sweden in 4th place, which performed well in terms of renewable energies and greenhouse gas emissions. Morocco came in 5th due to its rapid expansion of renewables and an ambitious carbon reduction target \u2014 the North African nation is on track to generate 42 percent of its electricity needs through renewables by 2020. Also making the \"good\" category were\u00a0India (11)\u00a0and the European Union as a whole (16). India ranked relatively well due to its dynamic expansion of renewables, relatively low per capita emissions and an ambitious 2030 climate target \u2014 though plans for new coal-fired power plants counted against the Asian powerhouse. The EU's moderate performance in terms of emissions and energy efficiency was somewhat compensated by high marks for climate policy \u2014 especially measures to achieve the 2030 climate target, as well as the European Commission's efforts to push for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\u00a0  While Germany is closing coal mines like this one near Bottrop, a lack of commitment to a full coal phaseout means the country is no longer a climate protection pioneer China (33) made it into the \"moderate\" category for the first time after emissions leveled off between 2014 and 2016 \u00a0\u2014 though emissions have since risen again. Lurking in the index basement are G20 countries such as Japan (49), Russia (52), Canada (54), and Australia (55), while the last two places are occupied by the United States (59) and Saudi Arabia (60). Yet again, Australia ranked\u00a0among the very low-performing countries in three of the CCPI's categories \u2014 GHG emissions, energy use and climate policy \u2014 and in terms of renewable energy, with experts emphasizing the need to reduce its\u00a02030 emission reduction targets. It placed\u00a0just ahead of the\u00a0USA, which has been in free fall since the climate-denying Trump administration took office nearly two years ago. The US performed poorly to very badly on emissions, renewables and energy efficiency, and hardly surprisingly in terms of climate policy after President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement. Leadership \u2014 also on renewables In view of the regression in climate policy on the part of the United States, the EU must grow into a leadership role, said Stephan Singer of the Climate Action Network,\u00a0a co-publisher of the CCPI report. \"It is very important now that the EU needs to enhance its current climate commitment to show leadership,\" Singer said at the presentation of the report in Katowice.

Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study. But if you start now with the other nine actions, your kids might be able to live in a better world. Author: Irene Banos Ruiz While the scores awarded by the climate policy experts were lower in 2018 than all previous years, renewable energies continue to expand. \"Before Paris, the world was heading to 4-5 degrees of global warming. Now we are still on a path to more than 3 degrees \u2014 still a catastrophic perspective,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, a report co-author from the NewClimate Institute \"But the costs of electricity from wind and solar have dropped by roughly a third since then, so all countries can increase ambition and pace,\" he added.

Without this instrument in particular, Burck warns that Germany's \"cost-efficient transformation will not succeed in time.\" Poland, host of the upcoming COP24 climate conference, has long had a love affair with coal.

{"id": null, "body": "     Poland, host of the upcoming COP24 climate conference, has long had a love affair with coal. Can it say goodbye and commit to renewables? Poland's love affair with coal goes way back. For decades coal was the favorite for energy: mined locally, and cheap. In those days, the environment was pretty low on the agenda. But things are slowly changing. When the Iron Curtain fell in 1989, coal made up almost 100 percent of Poland's energy mix. Nearly 40 years later, in 2018, the country turned to other sources for 20 percent of its power \u2014 now its wind power operators boast that Poland has more installed turbines than Denmark. The official plan is to reduce the share of coal in Poland's energy mix to 60 percent by 2030. For a country that has long relied on coal as the backbone of its economy, that entails a dramatic transformation.\u00a0 Yet, with coal reserves in existing mines running low and most power plants due to retire well before mid-century, environmentalists argue the target is actually a renewed vow of commitment to a relationship long turned sour. Propping up an ailing industry Coal-fired plants in Poland have long relied on subsidies. According to the International Institute for Sustainable Development \u00a0(IISD), low-quality coal and very old power plants \u2014 30 years old, on average \u2014 mean the sector needs help to turn a profit.\u00a0 A\u00a0 2017 report by Warsaw-based think-tank WiseEuropa \u00a0shows that from 1990 to 2016, Poles paid about \u20ac2 billion ($2.28 billion) each year to support the\u00a0coal sector. Adding in costs related to health and climate, it's estimated each citizen paid almost \u20ac450 per year on average. And now, carbon prices \u2014 which tripled over the last year alone \u2014 are starting to make pumping out all that pollution a lot less affordable. Meanwhile, the price of renewables is falling, making them cost-competitive. These days, it's not enough to ensure the power supply is cheap and reliable. Climate protection must be a third, central pillar of energy policy. \"With renewable costs coming down, we can achieve all three of them at the same time,\" Monika Morawiecka, head of strategy for PGE, Poland's largest energy company, said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With COP24 just around the corner, Poland is trying to clean up its image Pressure for change Poles protesting their country's filthy air and climate sins have helped spur this change of focus. And unhappy customers have perhaps done even more. Morawiecka says a PGE buyer that exports energy globally told her: \"You know, clients are asking me politely \u2014 but in few years they will demand that I have my carbon footprint managed. And if not, they will stop buying from me.\" But while energy providers are changing their ways for economic reasons \u2014 and in response to the European Union cracking down on air pollution and piling on the pressure over\u00a0climate targets \u2014 environmentalists say the government needs to act. Anna Ogniewska, an energy expert with Greenpeace Poland, doesn't pull her punches. \"Practically speaking, what Polish government is doing is mainly supporting coal,\" she told DW. Poland makes the right noises about green energy to the EU, Ogniewska says, but back home it's planning new coal mines and power stations, and not doing nearly enough to encourage the growth of renewables. A lingering goodbye Still, Poland might be forced to break up with coal \u2014\u00a0whether it feels ready to say goodbye or not. Because lignite (or brown coal) reserves from operating mines are expected to run out by 2030. Hard coal might last a little longer, but not much. And Polish society is already showing signs of moving on. Once a standard profession, coal mining is not as popular as it used to be. According to Patryk Bialas, energy adviser at the Euro-Centrum technology park in Katowice, Poland's young people now prefer to work in the renewable energy sector. With coal on its way out and energy demand growing 1.2 percent a year, clean energy is a must for the future, and the country needs to plan accordingly. Onshore wind power has nearly doubled since 2013, and power production from gas has already increased by 20 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. Poland's\u00a0draft energy policy for\u00a02040 sets a target of 21 percent of renewable energy sources in final energy consumption by\u00a02030. Yet it ends support for onshore wind power. The search for alternatives Gas is cleaner and more flexible than coal, making it a better partner for fluctuating renewable energy. But because most gas is imported from Russia, Michal Kurtyka \u2014\u00a0president of\u00a0COP24 and secretary of Poland's environment ministry \u2014 says diversifying the energy supply is crucial. \"This is why Poland is partnering with Norway and Denmark,\" he said. The Baltic Pipe Project will allow transport of gas from Norway to the Polish markets. Offshore wind power is also part of this equation. PGE, the largest wind investor in Poland, is developing three offshore wind projects, the first to be ready by 2025. According to the Foundation for Sustainable Energy, Poland's installed offshore wind capacity in the Baltic Sea could reach 4 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2030 and 8 GW by the end of 2035. Solar energy, meanwhile, is new on the Polish scene but could cover summer peaks in energy demand when people across the country switch on the air-con. Yet Greenpeace says there are still restrictions on building wind and solar infrastructure, and not much in the way of policy to support it. Beyond that, a move to renewables is a major political risk. The government is deeply concerned about losing votes from the Silesia mining region, which are among the most decisive for national elections. Nuclear power is supposed to also have a privileged place in the energy mix. In 2040, it should make more than 15\u00a0percent of Poland's electricity generation. But how, remains a mystery. Keeping up with the neighbors Instead of supporting renewables, the government's main strategy is built around carbon neutrality \u2014 achieving a balance between emissions and carbon sequestration, mainly through experimental carbon capture technologies and sustainable forest management.\u00a0 And there is another factor keeping Poland wedded to coal: peer pressure. Poland shares a love of coal with its neighbor Germany. While Poland is typically portrayed as polluting and coal-dependent, its neighbor has long been hailed as a green leader. In fact, Germany has been the pioneer of the Energiewende. But that green image has been tarnished as the country struggles with its own coal phaseout . If Germany keeps using coal, Poles argue, why shouldn't they? Germany and Poland are still the biggest producers of coal-fired power in the EU. But Germany has greatly expanded its renewable energy capacity, and is actively grappling with the social and economic impacts of breaking up with coal. Poland is following this process with interest, Morawiecka said. At least 6,000 people gathered in the heart of western German coal country Saturday to demand an end to coal use. People from around the world joined forces with a local movement that started back in 2012 with a handful of activists trying to stop the expansion of a brown coal mine and save the last 200 hectares of the millennia-old Hambach Forest. The message was clear: Coal is a global problem. The protestors spanned many ages and walks of life. There were young activists dressed in wigs or hazmat suits, but also families and the elderly. People with reduced mobility followed the march at their own pace. A nine-year-old boy was keen to voice his view on the dirty fossil fuel, telling DW he was worried about his future but expected the authorities to do the right thing and give up coal. Demonstrators split up, some continuing the authorized protest while others took direct action to block coal infrastructure. A hundred people tried to stop the diggers at two nearby coal mines; close to 40 people were arrested. Trying to reach the train line, another 1,000 protestors ended up on the nearby A4 highway, resulting in around 250 arrests. Both the diggers and traffic were stopped. A third group was determined to block the railway transporting coal from the Hambach mine to the three power plants where it is destined to be burned. They had their work cut out, with police attempting to block the activists from approaching the railway. In the end they had to change their route several times, running through fields and navigating dense forest to reach their target. On route to the rail lines, there were no major clashes with police but the atmosphere was extremely tense. Police officers on horseback followed protesters up to the edge of the forest, preventing them from changing course. Outbreaks of nerves rippled through activists and horses \u2014 without it being clear who triggered what. Once the protesters entered the forest, the situation became more fraught. They had to walk carefully to avoid tripping over branches while dodging the police \u2014 who physically shoved them as they approached \u2014 or each other as, from time to time, the crowd suddenly surged without warning. In the midst of the chaos, activists called for calm, shouting to one another to stick together and remain peaceful. They held on to each other so no one would fall, get lost, or get caught by the police. Others conferred over the best route to proceed toward the rail line. Eventually, thousands of protesters arrived at the rail lines. Police officers initially tried to prevent them from climbing down on the tracks, but they were outnumbered. Activists had hung guide ropes down the slopes beforehand, but most people simply slid, ran or tumbled down the bank. Within just a few minutes, the railway was engulfed in a crowd of protestors. After an exhausting two-hour scramble, protesters sat down for a rest. The weather was bitingly cold, but there was an air of cheer as the crowd made itself comfortable on the tracks. For now at least, the energy companies couldn't transport coal from mines to their power plants \u2014 a victory celebrated under the watchful eyes of police on the hills above. The police warned that the direct action was illegal, and offered protesters the chance to abandon their blockade without penalties. But most stayed put overnight. Organizers said their protest blocked coal infrastructure for around 24 hours \u2014 which they judged a success. The last 50 to leave the protest had chained themselves to the tracks and had to be forcibly evicted one by one.

The movie was some time in the making - reportedly due to major reshoots following poor reception from test audiences.\u00a0 As the release date finally came into view, real-life catastrophes like hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria filled our screens with images all-too-close to those in the Geostorm trailer. Many commentators have taken a dim view of the film's flippant treatment of climate-related disasters. But can the emerging genre of climate\u00a0fiction \u2013\u00a0or \"cli-fi\" \u2013\u00a0in cinema play a positive role in the fight against climate change? A failure of imagination Most people accept that climate change is real. Two out of three people in Latin America, Africa and Europe think global warming is a very serious problem, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center . Yet\u00a0a threat on this scale can feel disconnected from our personal lives. Most Americans believe global warming will harm people in the United States, but almost all are convinced it won't harm them personally. Most of us continue our high-carbon lifestyles and hope for the best. So why don't we get our butts off the couch and take action? Research suggests it comes\u00a0down to a failure of imagination. Climate change is mostly invisible. We can see the immediate effects such as more regular heatwaves, floods and storms. But we cannot see CO2, or feel changes in\u00a0average global temperature. Accelerated climate change hits Afghanistan in 'Geostorm' So might Hollywood movies about climate change help us \"see\" global warming? Can films and novels inspire us to take action - even as we relax\u00a0on that comfy couch? Researchers say yes \u2013\u00a0and no. The power of storytelling \"There's only so far scientists can go in presenting data and appealing to people's rational intellect,\" Andrew Hoffman, author of \"How Culture Shapes the Climate Change Debate,\" told DW.\u00a0 \"To touch people's hearts, the key is to be able to tell stories \u2013\u00a0stories of what climate change means, how we understand it, what kind of futures are possible.\" But Hoffman doesn't think\u00a0current Hollywood movies are hitting the mark. They tend to frame the issue too negatively, focusing on catastrophe, disaster and dramatic changes happening over night. If audiences defy critics and flock to see \"Geostorm,\" it won't be the first global-warming disaster flick to pull crowds.\u00a0 Back in 2004, \"The Day After Tomorrow\" turned a story of one man's fight to save the world from an accelerated climate catastrophe into a box-office hit.\u00a0 But critics argue these movies' reliance on a heroic individual to save the planet leave most of us feeling powerless.\u00a0 Empowering the people Ed Maibach is director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, located near Washington, DC. He\u00a0researches how to mobilize populations to adopt behavior to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 'The Day After Tomorrow' came under fire for scientific inaccuracy \"I personally haven't seen or read one [movie or novel] yet that I thought would make a difference,\" Maibach told DW.\u00a0He believes that action taken by ordinary people should play a greater role in cli-fi narratives.\u00a0 \"Convince people they can make a difference, make them feel powerful,\" Maibach says. \"Anger can help, too. The combination of anger, hope, and agency has stopped wars, toppled dictatorships, and earned people the right to marry the one they love.\" Still, cli-fi isn't all about disaster movies. In comedy-drama \"Downsizing,\" out later this year, people are shrunk to save resources.\u00a0 And the genre extends to novels. \"Carbon Diaries 2015\" by Saci Lloyd follows a 16-year-old student in London as the government imposes carbon rationing in the wake of climate catastrophes. And in \"Memory of Water\" by Emmi It\u00e4ranta, water has become so scarce that wars are fought over it. Researchers say creative exploration can change how we relate to our planet, turning dry facts into something tangible. \"Accepting the idea that climate change is real is not only an act of the intellect - it has to be personal,\" Hoffman says. \"We will protect what we love; we won't protect a bunch of scientific equations.\" Merging fact and fiction Yet there are inherent dangers in using fiction over scientific fact to energize\u00a0people . Movies like \"The Day After Tomorrow,\" and 1995's \"Waterworld,\" were criticized for scientific inaccuracy. Craig Russell is the author of \"Fragment,\" an eco-thriller about a massive Antarctic ice sheet that floats in the open ocean threatening to destroy all marine life in its path and flood coastal regions.\u00a0 Craig Russell's novel 'Fragment' deals with melting ice in the Antarctica and draws heavily on scientific fact He says it's crucial to be scientifically correct in climate-change storytelling. \"By giving people accurate information, you gain credibility,\" Russell told DW.\u00a0 As a student, Russell worked at an Arctic weather station, and has been fascinated by the poles ever since. When two ice shelfs in the Antarctica collapsed, he started to think \"what if?\" His novel was the result. In it, he provides detailed scientific information about Antarctic\u00a0ice-melt. But he also introduces a whale that can communicate with humans \u2013\u00a0mixing fact with fantasy. Hoffman says that's an approach that can have a real impact.\u00a0 \"Scientific correctness is important and you don't want to be totally misrepresenting the science,\" he said. \"Yet, if you are trying to be evocative or nuanced, you have to let the artist be free. They shouldn't always be worried about giving the audience a lesson of climate science 101.\" \"Let's turn artists loose to touch people's heart on this issue,\" Hoffman added. News of a sixth mass extinction makes for frightening reading. But is it really too late - and can changing how we frame the issue inspire a more harmonious relationship with our planet?

Thousands of bats fell dead out of the trees as Sydney's parched suburbs reached their hottest temperature on record earlier this month:\u00a047 degrees Celsius (117 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0saw parts of the city receiving the dubious honor of being the hottest place on the planet that day. That would be considered an unusually hot day, even in the Sahara Desert.

A total of 87 fires raged across the state of New South Wales at the heat wave's peak in February. For Australia, these heat waves are likely to only get worse. Although it is the developed country already most feeling the effects of climate change , heatwaves that are longer, hotter and more frequent are yet to come, according to a 2016 report from the Climate Council . Professor David Karoly from the University of Melbourne told DW that in the best case scenario, if global greenhouse gas emissions are effectively curbed, Australia would be\u00a0on course to experience heat waves five times as frequently by the end of this century compared with\u00a0the latter part of the 20th century. Sydney's citizens flocked to its beaches to cool down - those living farther inland didn't have that luxury But if emissions remain high -\u00a0which Professor Karoly pointed out as the current track\u00a0in Australia and the rest of the world -\u00a0then heat waves would\u00a0increase in frequency by a factor of 10 by the end of this century in the country.

Skepticism down -\u00a0but far from out In a country revealed as having the highest rates of\u00a0climate skepticism in the world - at the end of the list\u00a0of 14 industrialized countries in a study published in 2015, showing nearly one in five Australians didn't believe climate change was happening - the blistering heat is bringing the realities of climate change to the fore. And with this, a seeming shift in attitudes. Around 60 percent of Australians believe climate change is real and caused by human\u00a0activity, a 6\u00a0percent rise since December 2016, according to a poll carried out by Essential Research and published this week. The proportion of those believing we may just be witnessing a normal fluctuation in the earth's climate fell slightly, by 2\u00a0percent to a total of\u00a025 percent over the same period. An earlier,\u00a0separate survey for the Climate Institute published in September 2016 put the proportion of Australians saying climate change is happening at 77 percent, up from 70 percent in 2015. Adrian Enright, policy manager on climate change for\u00a0 WWF Australia , told DW he believes that Australians witnessing whatvthe devastating effects of higher temperatures are is helping turn the tide. Following a series of smashed heat records, he told DW it's\u00a0\"not surprising that in a recent poll, we saw a jump in people associating global warming with human activities.\" \"The impacts of the recent heatwave, including off-the-scale bushfire risk warnings, have illustrated to Australians the sorts of risks\u00a0we are being exposed to if we fail to curb carbon pollution,\"\u00a0said Enright. Sports fans tried to keep cool while watching tennis at the Sydney Olympic Park in January this year \"Climate change skepticism is overall declining, as both the scientific evidence\u00a0and our first-hand experience of heatwaves and extreme weather events increases.\" The devastating coral bleaching suffered by the Great Barrier Reef \u00a0that reached its peak in 2016 \"brought the reality of climate change home for many Australians,\"\u00a0added Enright. Lobbying fueling climate denial\u00a0flame But although climate change skepticism may be seeing a decline, Professor Karoly thinks it remains worryingly prevalent -\u00a0thanks in no small part to a powerful fossil fuel lobby. \"In Australia 40 years ago, there was consensus on climate change,\"\u00a0he told DW. \"The conservative Australian government of the late 1980s and 1990s was committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\" But he said that as soon as there seemed to be serious government\u00a0plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce\u00a0growth in fossil fuels, the coal industry and a number of media outlets effectively downplayed signs of climate change. Stocking up on water to keep dehydration at bay during the deadly heat Professor Karoly told DW that although heat waves have \"had some impact on the population wanting strong action on climate change,\"\u00a0this is \"being combated by well-funded and well-organized campaigns that have led to a continuing apparent policy debate around\u00a0what action on climate change is needed.\" Australia's poor climate credentials The current government, headed by the conservative Liberal Party and the rural-based National Party, revoked Australia's carbon trading scheme two years ago , Karoly pointed out. \"Since then, emissions have grown for two years, [although they had] fallen during the previous five years,\"\u00a0he said. Australia is the least-active country among the G20 when it comes to climate protection, according to a report by Climate Transparency in 2016, receiving the worst possible rating of \"very poor\"\u00a0for its performance on overall climate policy. And Australians are feeling the repercussions. Simon Bullock, senior campaigner on climate change at Friends of the Earth , told DW: \"Ordinary Australians'\u00a0health, agriculture and nature are all at increasing risk from drought, heat, flood and fires. \"Sadly, people are now seeing and experiencing climate change in their own lives. No amount of media misinformation from climate deniers can alter that.\" An increased risk of floods and droughts, easier spread for infectious diseases, lower crop yields: Europe must better prepare for the consequences of climate change, says the European Environment Agency (EEA).

{"id": null, "body": "     Massive flooding has caused devastation across parts of central Europe, claiming dozens of lives. Scientists say that climate change had a role in it. 'Ordinarily, we only see weather like this in winter,' says an environment official in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia At least 103 people were reported dead and dozens missing Friday in Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands after heavy storms and\u00a0rainfall caused rivers and water reservoirs to burst their banks and flash floods turned streets into raging torrents, sweeping away cars\u00a0and destroying buildings.\u00a0 Over the past several weeks, Germany has experienced a roller coaster ride\u00a0of high temperatures and\u00a0dryness followed by\u00a0episodes of heavy precipitation. On Wednesday and Thursday, that\u00a0phenomenon was punctuated by catastrophic flooding in multiple regions across western Germany and neighboring countries.\u00a0Experts say such extreme weather used to happen once in a\u00a0generation but may happen more frequently in the future\u00a0\u2014 and with more intensity \u2014 a sign\u00a0that climate change is impacting\u00a0our lives. Heavy rainfalls and storms pounded Germany\u2019s western states and caused rivers to burst their banks, inundating towns and villages. Torrential overflow swept away vehicles, destroyed roads and bridges and reduced some houses to rubble. Some survivors were trapped on their rooftops for hours before they were airlifted by helicopters. The flood's damage and death toll\u2014about 200 dead\u2014made it one of the deadliest disasters to hit the country in more than half a century. During the height of the flooding, some 1,300 people were reported missing in just one German district, Ahrweiler. Phone and power lines are still down in some areas, at least two highway roads need fundamental repair. The damage to infrastructure hampered immediate rescue efforts and threatened to leave the affected regions facing a long and difficult road to recovery. At least four firefighters in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia lost their lives during rescue operations since flooding began Wednesday, according to Bernd Schneider, chairman of the NRW Firefighters Association. Dams across the region reached their capacities and threaten to overflow amid the massive rainfall. The flood, damaged water facilities and created a water shortage in some regions. Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the badly-hit town of Schuld, personally surveying the damage and speaking to residents and emergency workers. She described the situation as \"terrifying\" and called for more to be done to tackle climate change in the wake of the floods. Over a thousand soldiers and more than 200 military vehicles have been deployed in western Germany over the last few days, as volunteers line up to help flood victims. As the water begins to recede, questions are emerging over whether residents received timely warnings before the floods. Critics say that if the country was adequately prepared for disaster, the loss would have been much less. \"Ordinarily, we only see weather like this\u00a0in winter,\"\u00a0as Bernd Mehlig, an environment official from the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW)\u00a0\u2014 the region hit hardest by the rains \u2014\u00a0told public broadcaster WDR. \"Something like this, with this intensity, is completely unusual in summer.\" Speaking with WDR Thursday, a spokesperson for the city of Hagen's crisis team predicted that\u00a0water would reach levels not seen more than four times a century, with parts of the city\u00a0reported inaccessible and\u00a0isolated due to high water. \"This is the new normal,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Johannes Quaas, a meteorologist at Leipzig University in eastern Germany.\u00a0\"Climate change is also changing the definition of normal weather. We are slowly approaching a new normal that includes different rainfall patterns.\" Evidence suggests temperatures are increasing at higher rates in the Northern Hemisphere, likely leading to more significant weather changes Rising temperatures make extreme weather events more intense. When air heats up it contains more moisture, a phenomenon scientists discovered back in the 19th century. An increase of 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0in temperature increases air's capacity to hold moisture by 7%. Rising global temperatures are also leading to a more rapid evaporation of water on land and at sea \u2014 subsequently causing more extreme precipitation events and heavier storms.\u00a0 \"The rainfall we've experienced across Europe over the past few days is extreme weather whose intensity is being strengthened by climate change \u2014 and will continue to strengthen further with more warming,\" said Friederike Otto from the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. Germany's National Meteorological Service (DWD) said that heavy rainfall events have gotten stronger as temperatures have risen. But it cautioned that the rise was strongest during winter and \"the picture is still unclear for the summer months\" when heavy storms usually strike.  One attribution study of extreme summer rainfall in 2013 \u2014 which led to sever flooding on the Danube and Elbe rivers \u2014 did not find climate change had played a role. The DWD said it could not answer whether climate change had made the current summer floods stronger without first doing an such a study. Two weeks before the flood, research done by a group of scientists in the United Kingdom found that global warming will increase the likelihood of intense rainstorms across Europe. The study suggests that, due to reduced temperature\u00a0differential between the poles and tropics, storms move slower than they did in past summers. That could lead to heavy rainfall in one particular area, and also raise the risk of flash floods. According to the study, once an uncommon weather event for Europe, slow-moving storms might happen 14 times more frequently across the continent by the end of the century. Storms moving more slowly dump more rain in one particular area \"As an industrial country, Germany is heating up twice as fast as the global warming rate,\" said Quass. \"That means the chances of heavy rainfall are 20% higher\u00a0compared to the 19th century\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and 10% higher than when I was born, about four decades ago.\" When soil and drainage systems cannot absorb water quickly, or factors like urban development prevent rainfall from dissipating, surface runoff can develop into\u00a0torrential flash flooding and cause significant damage. Predicting extreme weather is not difficult\u00a0but it is still almost impossible to accurately predict where exactly a storm will dump immense amounts of rain and what\u00a0areas will be hit hardest, said Quass, adding that this makes it difficult for communities\u00a0to prepare for\u00a0disaster and mitigate losses. Moreover, with the destruction of certain vegetation and other land barriers as a result of changing\u00a0temperature and\u00a0weather patterns, many natural flood zones have disappeared. \"As long as we keep on emitting CO2, we are likely to keep seeing\u00a0such heavy rains,\" said Quass.\u00a0 \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Is climate change fueling floods in Germany?", "article_name": "is-climate-change-fueling-floods-in-germany", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/is-climate-change-fueling-floods-in-germany/a-58282637", "date_published": "2021-07-15 00:00:00", "article_length": 7086, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:00:46.592373"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Many of the technologies needed to stop climate change are still in early stages of development, a study of green tech patents has revealed. Greater action is required to bring them to market in time. A study of patents in green energy technology has revealed that innovation in that sector is slowing down Global climate targets can only be reached with a major acceleration in clean-energy innovation , as many of the technologies required to bring down CO2 emissions are currently only at the prototype or demonstration phase. This is the conclusion of a joint report released Tuesday from the European Patent Office (EPO) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). \"Around half the emissions reductions to get to net zero by 2050 may need to come from technologies that are not yet on the market,\" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol in a press release. The report \"Patents and the energy transition: global trends in clean energy technology innovation\"\u00a0looks at trends in low-carbon energy innovation between 2000 and 2019 in terms of international patent families (IPFs). An IPF represents a unique, high-value invention for which a patent application was filed at two or more patent offices around the globe. Patent applications can be considered an early indicator of future technological trends as they are filed months or years before the products go to market. The report found that the number of patents for inventions related to low-carbon energy technologies has gone up over the past two decades. However, the average annual growth rate of low-carbon energy patents in recent years is only a quarter of what it was a decade ago. Between 2017 and 2019, the number of patents for inventions related to low-carbon energy technologies around the world grew by an average rate of 3.3% per year. The average growth rate from 2000 to 2013, by contrast, was 12.5%. Of the technologies that had\u00a0been patented, some were\u00a0already being used on an industrial scale while others were\u00a0still in the early stages of development, the report said. Since 2000, over 420,000 IPFs have been filed worldwide in the area of low-carbon energy. The study revealed that focus in the field was\u00a0moving away from inventions that addressed renewable energy supply. Today, patents related to end-use and cross-cutting-enabling technologies dominate. For the past five years, end-use technologies \u2014 those that support the use of energy or fuel switching in end-use applications such as transport, buildings or industrial production \u2014 have accounted for the majority (60%) of all low-carbon energy inventions. Cross-cutting enabling technologies, meanwhile, increased from 27% of all low-carbon energy IPFs in 2000 to 34% in 2019 and\u00a0 have had the strongest growth of the three sectors since 2017. Enabling technologies play a role in both the supply and end-use sector, and also help existing infrastructures to improve their reliance on clean energy. Patents in this area include technology for batteries, hydrogen and smart grids as well as carbon capture and utilization . Such technologies are of increasing importance because of their ability to connect a variety of clean energy sources. This creates the opportunity for more flexible energy solutions. Patents for energy supply technologies, including renewables, have fallen since 2012. This, the study concludes, is due to the market maturity of some renewable technologies, like solar PV, and a lack of improvements to others, such as biofuels and ocean energy . Energy supply technologies accounted for only 17% of all low-carbon inventions in 2019. Electric vehicles have been a key driver of clean-energy innovation over the past decade. In the report's\u00a0global ranking of patent applicants, automotive companies and their main battery suppliers accounted for 12 of the top 15 patent applicants over the past 20 years. In terms of geography, European companies and research institutes currently boast the largest number of low-carbon energy inventions, accounting for 28% of patents between 2010 and 2019. Of this, Germany alone registered 12%. Japanese companies , however, are leading in electric vehicle technology, batteries and hydrogen, while the US is leader in aviation, biofuel and carbon capture technologies. \"This report is a clear call for action to step up research and innovation into new low-carbon energy technologies\u00a0and improve existing ones,\" said EPO President Antonio Campinos. \"While it reveals some encouraging trends across countries and industry sectors, including in key cross-cutting technologies, it also highlights the need to further accelerate innovation in clean-energy technologies, some of which are still only emerging.\" \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Tech needed to halt climate change still underdeveloped", "article_name": "tech-needed-to-halt-climate-change-still-underdeveloped", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/tech-needed-to-halt-climate-change-still-underdeveloped/a-57339898", "date_published": "2021-04-27 00:00:00", "article_length": 4804, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:00:47.643451"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Researchers are honing in on a little-studied but significant consequence of climate change: male infertility. Could this potential cause of extinction and biodiversity loss also threaten the human species? Men have long understood the dangers of exposing their reproductive glands to excessive heat. More than a decade ago, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey publicly admitted that all that time near hot stoves ultimately caused him fertility loss and a low sperm count. \"My balls were burning,\" he said, with typical bluntness.\u00a0\u00a0 From sitting too long with a laptop, to boiling saunas\u00a0and hot cellphones in tight jean pockets, burning issues around the midriff have become a pressing fertility enemy for modern men. Recent research is implicating\u00a0rising heat due to climate change as an extinction threat for certain species \u2014 so what about our own? Read more :\u00a0 No help for the infertile in Africa The world warms, births decline While\u00a0day-to-day thermal threats to male reproductivity can be combated with common sense, what happens when there is little escape from a world that is warming due to climate change? Sweltering \u2014 and less fertile? This past July, Alan Barreca, an environmental economist from the University of California in\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0released a study showing that \"temperature shocks\" linked to climate change were reducing birth rates, despite increased sexual activity\u00a0in\u00a0summer months. Derived from 80 years of birth and weather data out of the United States, the study confirmed a higher number of babies being born in August and September (nine months after the depths of winter), while fewer babies were conceived in summer due to higher temperatures. The researchers warned that the higher frequency and severity of heat waves \u2014 which is expected\u00a0as climate change carries on \u2014 will hasten this decline in fertility. \"Climate change projections show dramatic increases in hot weather,\" Barreca told DW. \"This increase in hot weather will harm our reproductive health in the future.\" Damaging the seed of life This human dimension to the problem of decreased fertility in a warming world is just one part of a significantly more far-reaching problem. A study by researchers at the University of East Anglia, published today in Nature Communications , shows \"clear evidence\" that heat-wave stress reduces \"sperm number and viability\" in insects, those most ubiquitous of living creatures. Climate change is affecting reproduction among insects \"In warm-blooded systems, heat is not a good thing for male fertility,\" Matthew Gage, a professor of evolutionary ecology at the University of East Anglia and\u00a0lead researcher on the study, told DW. However, humans and other warm-blooded animals are able to regulate their internal reproductive systems, meaning that their sperm is somewhat protected under heat stress, Gage explained. Yet as heat waves become more frequent, few have looked at \"cold-blooded organisms [such as insects] that comprise the majority of biodiversity on Earth,\" he\u00a0added. Read more:\u00a0 Beetle mania: The planet's most successful creatures? After exposing beetles that\u00a0thrive in tropical environments to heat stress, the research not only confirmed a hunch about fertility loss in the planet's most common species, but also noted \"male reproductive damage\" and \"transgenerational impacts\" that could help clarify increasing species extinction rates. It's the first such study to reveal a link between heat-wave stress and long-lasting genetic or DNA damage \u2014 and the potential for\u00a0heat stress to create permanently sterile males. Read more :\u00a0 Biodiversity collapse imminent in world's tropics, study says This beetle can measure up to 17cm in length, in part thanks to its enormous mandibles - the pair of appendages near its mouth. Also known as the 'sabertooth longhorn beetle' this insect dwells in the rainforests of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, the Guianas and Brazil. There are 11 species of the giant weta in the world, and the largest can be up to 10cm in length - not including their spindly legs or long antennae. They're also known to be rather heavy - with one example recording 70g. The beetles are unique to New Zealand, and all but one species are considered endangered. Among the largest insects on earth, the Goliath beetle can measure up to 11cm and weigh 100 grams in the larval stage (although adults are around half this weight). There are five species of Goliath beetle. They're found in tropical rainforests in Africa, where they mainly eat tree sap and fruit. This butterfly is the largest in the world, with females' wingspans reaching just over 25cm. An endangered species, it is restricted to about 100km of coastal rainforest in the Oro Province in eastern Papua New Guinea. The species was named in 1907 in honor of Alexandra of Denmark. This is what's known as a 'spider wasp' because - yep, you guessed it - it hunts tarantula spiders. They use their sting - one of the most painful insect stings in the world - to paralyze their prey before hauling it to their nest, where they lay a single egg on the victim, which when it hatches to a larva eats the prey alive. At about 5cm long, it's one of the largest wasps in the animal kingdom. This is a species of rhinoceros beetle, known for its feisty behavior. Named after Atlas, a Titan condemned to hold up the sky for eternity in Greek mythology, the male beetles can reach up to 13cm in length. They're found in southern Asia, particularly Indonesia. The giant water bug encompasses a large species of carnivorous freshwater insects, which includes the 'Lethocerus' that can grow to more than 12cm in length. Their large foreleg pincers are used to catch underwater prey like small fish and frogs. In some places they're known as 'toe biters' because of their tendency to deliver a painful nip when disturbed by swimmers that get too close.\u00a0 This insect may have a tiny body, but it's wingspan measures a whopping 25-30cm, and it has a wing surface area of about 400cm squared. It lives in dry rainforests and shrublands throughout South Asia, South East Asia, and East Asia. It doesn't eat - it's only purpose as an adult is to find a mate, which takes around two weeks. Once they breed and the females lay eggs, they die. This exquisite insect is usually between 1.5cm and 16cm long, but can reach lengths of up to 20cm. They are carnivorous and feed mainly on other insects, although females sometimes eat their mate just after, or even during, mating. Formidable predators, the praying mantis can turn its head 180 degrees to observe its surroundings with all five of its eyes. Only officially discovered in 2016, the only recorded spotting of this superbly long stick insect measured it at 62.4cm. Found in the Guangxi Zhuang region of China by Zhao Li, of the Insect Museum of West China, it's the longest insect in the world. Li brought it back to the museum where it laid six eggs - after hatching, even the smallest offspring measured 26cm.  Author: Charli Shield Explaining biodiversity loss \"Could this be one of the reasons why populations decline and go extinct under climate change?\" Gage asked. \"Obviously, if you're not very good at reproducing, that's not going to help your population viability,\" he pointed out. A heat wave will ultimately pass and a creature may\u00a0survive it \u2014 but, added Gage, \"this can't undo the problem of damaged sperm.\" Upon examining insects that had\u00a0suffered a heat wave, \"their offspring showed shortened lifespan and lower reproductive fitness,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Gage, pointing out that this represents a\u00a0transgenerational defect. The significance of this linkage is potentially devastating for biodiversity loss on a warming planet. Read more :\u00a0 Scientists race to name unknown species before biodiversity disappears That could be taken a step further as all living organisms\u00a0ultimately depend on each other for survival.

The study cited \"multiple environmental and lifestyle influences\" that might explain the declining sperm count. These included prenatal endocrine disruption\u00a0caused by exposure to chemicals, or maternal smoking \u2014 while exposure to pesticides could be a prime culprit in adult life.\u00a0 Yet\u00a0conclusive evidence linking declining fertility to any specific environmental problem is lacking. New research on the correlation between increased male infertility and climate change could therefore prove to be especially instructive. Moreover, if this link is contributing to broader biodiversity loss, the consequences will again be devastating for all life. This is why Gage and his team are starting to trace the link between heat stress and loss of male fertility \u2014 and transgeneration DNA defects \u2014 in a host of other insects and cold-blooded animals, including fish that spawn in very cold waters. \"It adds up to a pretty hard time for populations that are already suffering stress from all sorts of other things like habitat loss, or chemicals being put into the system,\" noted Gage of the latest death knell for threatened species across the planet. If further research\u00a0proves that\u00a0a warming\u00a0world is\u00a0impairing the seed of life, the revelation could be the ultimate inspiration to double down on fighting climate change. Read more :\u00a0 To save species, limit global warming Five films on, Jurassic Park still has us captivated by the idea of humans coming face-to-face with our planet's most terrifying former inhabitants. But the fantasy of resurrecting a dinosaur from DNA in the belly of an amber-trapped mosquito is a long way from reality. Leading de-extinction scientists say making use of genetic material more than a million years old won't be possible. Since the last male northern white rhino \u2014\u00a0a 45-year-old called Sudan \u2014\u00a0died earlier in 2018, elderly females Najon and Fatu are the last of their kind. But scientists hope that embryos in deep freeze could bring the \"functionally extinct\" species back from the edge. They were created in vitro from the sperm of a deceased male northern white and the eggs of the closely related southern white. When the dodo \u2014 a fatally trusting and tasty bird \u2014 disappered from Mauritius in the 17th century, few believed mankind could extinguish the life of an entire species. Only after 19th century naturalist Georges Cuvier proved extinction was possible did the dodo became a symbol of that destructive power. Now, the hunt is on for dodo DNA, in the hope we may also prove our power to resurrect. By the time the last Pyrenean ibex Celia died in 2000, scientists had already gathered and frozen her tissue cells. Three years later, a goat gave birth to Celia's clone, created by injecting her DNA into a goat's egg. In fact, dozens of hybrid eggs were implanted. Only seven animals became pregnant, and one carried to full term \u2014 and the resurrected ibex survived only a few minutes after birth. This is Martha, the last passenger pigeon, who died in 1914. The plump North American birds were a favorite for the plate, and hunting combined with deforestation wiped them out even as conservationists warned of their senseless demise. Revive & Restore, an organization that promotes \"de-extinction,\" sees the passenger pigeon as the perfect model project to show resurrection science's potential. European colonists in Australia put a bounty on the head of the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, a marsupial apex predator. The last known member of the species died in Hobart Zoo in 1936. Now, scientists have decoded the animal's entire genome from a joey preserved in ethanol, and hope to insert its genes into the DNA of its closest surviving relative, a diminutive marsupial called the numbat. The most impressive species with any chance of making a comeback is the woolly mammoth, whose closest living relative is the Asian elephant. Scientists at Harvard University say the ice-age giants could play a role in slowing permafrost melt and, therefore, climate change. But their \"Pleistocene Park\" concept would need 80,000 animals to have any real impact \u2014 pure science fiction, say critics. The auroch once roamed the length and breadth of Eurasia, but hunting and habitat loss wiped them out close to 400 years ago. Yet their descendents \u2014 domesticated cattle \u2014 live on, and \"back-breeding\" programs have tried to resurrect the auroch by selecting for characteristics of the wild ancestor. An early German attempt resulted in Heck cattle, which have been reintroduced to parts of Europe. We once shared the planet with other human species, like the Neanderthal, with whom we even interbred. Many of us still carry Neanderthal DNA. But we are also prime suspects in their extermination. What would it be like to confront the relations we once wiped out? Scientists are growing homo sapiens-Neanderthal hybrid brain matter in the lab to examine the differences between them and us.

But what about the emotional toll it takes on us? Psychologist Susie Burke tells the story of a woman who came to her for counselling after having her first child. Not because she was suffering from post-natal depression, but because she was \"struggling with the enormity of what she had done.\" She felt she had brought her child into a \"world she knew was going to be a lot harsher and a lot less safe,\" Burke told DW. \"She came to me when she was overwhelmed by this distress; questioning whether she had done the right thing. The fear she had for his future was really huge.\" Burke is an Australian psychologist and academic who specializes in eco-psychology.\u00a0She treats people suffering mental illness as a result of climate change, and also recently set up a free hotline called the \"Climate Change Psychological Support Network,\" where Australians can call a qualified psychologist to talk through their feelings about environmental change. \"One of the very first things people need to do to engage properly with climate change is to acknowledge how they feel about it and talk about it,\" Burke said. Eco-anxiety, grief and guilt A sense of pervasive loss, devastation and change are endemic to a world afflicted by climate change. Polar ice caps are melting, many animal species are going extinct; the weather is unpredictable and often extreme. We are increasingly aware of the impacts these changes are having on our physiological health - whether it be as stark as death and injury from extreme weather events, or more insidious harm from the worsening quality of water,\u00a0air and food. But as the emerging field of eco-psychology is revealing,\u00a0climate change is taking a significant toll on our mental health too. Read more: \u00a0 Climate change threatens crop nutrition, puts millions at risk Susie Burke says many people cope with negative emotions around climate change by ignoring them \"For people who are hearing and paying attention to what is happening to the climate, it is a huge weight and anxiety and fear,\" Burke said. Having worked in the field for nearly a decade, the psychologist describes observing people with \"anxiety and depression, flat moods, helplessness and hopelessness, and anger,\" as well as \"guilt and shame.\" She said this latter feeling is common among people who might not have endured direct trauma and loss as a result of climate change, but who experience vicarious distress\u00a0and are conscious of their part in the problem. \"They're aware these things are happening and it's not directly impacting them, but they know it's going to have a bigger impact on their children in the future or people in other parts of the world.\" Climate change differs from other global problems in that most people can relate their own behaviour to it, Burke added, in terms of causing CO2 emissions:\u00a0\"We can't do that with other big global problems like genocide\u00a0and conflict in the Middle East.\" Read more: \u00a0 How can cities adapt to a hotter climate? 13 years after Hurricane Katrina, many people live with lingering mental health affects A little-known problem Although it might seem self-evident that extreme changes resonate with people on an emotional level,\u00a0it is not something often talked about. The health of millions of people around the world is already being compromised by global warming. Scientists are now saying it is the major threat of the 21st century . But there is little emphasis on mental health. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge gap in the literature,\u201d Ashlee Cunsolo, researcher and director of an institute geared toward sustaining Indigenous culture in Labrador, Canada, told DW. In order for the globe to comprehensively tackle the health challenges that are arising out of climate change, Cunsolo argues that the mental health dimension of the problem must inform policymaking. This, she said, requires \"a mass system-wide societal shift\" in how climate change is thought about and what the potential long term impacts might be. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change includes a section that details the loss and damages from\u00a0climate change. Consolo notes that it\u00a0intitially conceptualised loss and damage in terms of \"infrastructure and the market\" when it was written in the 1990s. But now it\u00a0has been adjusted to account for \"intangible losses,\" such as \"cultural knowledge, language, and place,\" she said. Read more: \u00a0 The frozen tears of New Zealand's melting glaciers A loss of sea ice impacts Inuit communities' ability to hunt, travel and pass down their cultural traditions Inuit on thin ice Cunsolo first observed this aspect of climate change while working in public health in Eastern Canada with Inuit populations indigenous to the area. After having witnessed rapid changes\u00a0in their environment \u2013 such as melting sea ice and unpredictable weather - these communities, Cunsolo said, expressed a profound sense of \"grief associated with loss of place, loss of sea ice, loss of livelihoods.\" It was this research that prompted Cunsolo and her colleague, Neville Ellis, who works closely with farmers suffering drought in Western Australia, to create a new category of emotional trauma called \"ecological grief.\" Cunsolo describes this as \"the responding mental and emotional pain,\u00a0stress and sadness\u201d that arises from environmental change. \"The word 'Inuit' literally means 'people of the sea ice' \u2013 so this is a very deep, existential questioning of humanity\", the researcher said.\" People are really having their foundations impacted by these changes.\" Although climate scientists are warning that a 1 to 2 degree Celsius\u00a0temperature increase globally will have devastating effects around the globe \u2013 even making some parts of the world inhospitable \u2013 evidence has shown that Laborador has already surpassed this threshold and is instead looking at a temperature increase of 6 to 8 degrees Celsius. The unprecedented loss of sea ice that has already occurred has had an enormous impact on the Inuit communities' ability to hunt, travel, and practise their culture, Cunsolo said. \"There's a lot of concern for what it means for the future \u2013 a lot of anticipatory grief.\" \"Ecological grief\" has been seen in communities as disparate as farmers in Western Australia and Inuit in Canada Global reverberations But it isn\u2019t only those in the front line of environmental change who experience profound emotional responses and mental health impacts. For many people it is daunting\u00a0to grasp the full implications of climate change, including coming to terms with their own role in it and how they can help as individuals. Whether or not people are experiencing or observing firsthand rapid environmental changes, Cunsolo speaks of a \"pervasive sense of dread and doom and anxiety.\" \"I think ecological grief has emerged most prominently from people at the frontline, but I don\u2019t think we can say with certainty that they're experiencing it more than others.\" Often, she added, people who don\u2019t bear the burden of global warming's direct impacts, feel a sense of guilt\u00a0that they're \"stuck in a system that perpetuates climate change, but [they] can't get out of it.\"\u00a0 Many people become depressed and immobile, or \"rationalize the problem away,\" according to Burke.\u00a0 For this reason, the psychologist \u00a0has authored a handy guide - 'The Climate Change Empowerment Handbook' \u00a0\u00a0 which, she says, is designed to help people to see how they can effectively engage with the problem on a day-to-day basis.\u00a0 \"What we can't afford is for people to give up,\" Burke said. \"It's too big a problem. There is still time to turn the tide. We just need to have the will to do it - and the will comes from the people .\" Once, only explorers in search of adventure or scientific discovery braved the icy heart of the Arctic. But the ice is vanishing. August 29, 2008 marked a turning point: For the first time, merchant ships could navigate both the Northeast Passage and Northwest Passage, without icebreakers. This ship-friendly period in summer has been getting longer and longer ever since. The 6,500-kilometer-long (4,000-mile) Northeast Passage leads from Asia, past Russia and Norway, and connects the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean. The slightly shorter Northwest Passage runs past Canada toward New York. Both routes cross the Bering Strait and the Arctic Ocean. This is only possible if ice cover does not block the way. To get from Rotterdam to Tokyo, ships currently pass India and go through the Suez Canal in Egypt. That's about 6,000 kilometers longer than the route through the Northeast Passage. Ships travel to the US East Coast from Asia via the Pacific and through the Panama Canal. Here, too, taking the Northwest Passage cuts over 4,000 kilometers off the journey. In 2009, the Bremen-based Beluga shipping company sent two German heavy-lift carriers through the Northeast Passage for the first time. Since then, shipping traffic in the region has increased. Still, Burkhard Lemper of the Institute of Shipping Economics and Logistics in Bremen says the Arctic Ocean is not (yet) heavily frequented \u2014 if only because the route is only open at certain times of year. No climate scientist can say for sure how global warming will progress around the North Pole. But, \"Everyone agrees the Arctic will be ice-free within the next 30 to 50 years,\" says sea-ice expert Christian Haas of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. Researchers describe the Arctic as ice-free when ice cover falls below 1 million square kilometers in summer. Biologists fear for the unique wildlife in the Arctic as shipping traffic increases. Beluga whales, Greenland whales and walruses, for example, could be a risk, US researchers say in a study published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They studied 80 populations of marine mammals and found that more than half are resident along the Northeast or Northwest Passage. Scientists fear that narwhals in particular could suffer from shipping traffic in the Arctic Ocean. The marine mammals stay close to coastal pack ice. The males are easily recognizable by their helical tusk, which can become up to three meters long. This is a life-size replica in the Ozeanum Oceanographic Museum in Stralsund, Germany. Researchers and environmentalists are calling for guidelines on Arctic shipping. For example, ships should avoid the whales' main hunting grounds, fit sailing schedules around their migration, and keep noise and speed in check. \"This does not yet exist in the Arctic \u2014 that's the big difference from Antarctica,\" Greenpeace biologist Christian Bussau says. According to Greenpeace expert Bussau, only 50 ships pass through the Northeast and Northwest Passage each year. The German Shipowners' Association says the figure is in the double-digit range. But Bussau says time is of the essence: \"In the long run, there will be a lot going on in the Arctic.\" So far, there are no environmental regulations for shipping in the region. Author: Brigitte Osterath (hf) In 2017, parts of Europe, Canada and the US were ravaged by wildfires on an unprecedented scale. In 2018, new records are being set around the world as hot, dry temperatures and fires become the new normal.

{"id": null, "body": "     The United States and several other nations have pledged to cut carbon emissions faster, putting pressure on other big polluters to clean up their acts. Climate activists and scientists are calling on world leaders to fulfil their pledges to limit global heating US President Joe Biden promised to halve his\u00a0country's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels at a global climate summit to pressure other polluters to bring their emissions in line with international agreements. \"The cost of inaction keeps mounting. The United States isn't waiting,\" he said on Thursday in the opening address of the two-day summit hosted virtually by the White House. He also pledged\u00a0to double US contributions to global climate finance by 2024 and triple funding for adapting to its effects. \"No nation can solve this crisis on its own, and this summit is a step on a path to a secure, prosperous, and sustainable\u00a0future,\" he said. Several other countries also upped their pledges. Japan announced\u00a0plans to cut emissions 46% below 2013 levels by 2030. Canada said it would aim to slash emissions 40%-45% by 2030 below 2005 levels.\u00a0China's President Xi Jinping reiterated\u00a0his country's goal to\u00a0peak CO2\u00a0output before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, adding that coal use would gradually decrease in the second half of this decade. Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro pledged to go climate neutral by 2050, bringing his country's\u00a0goal forward by 10 years, and end illegal deforestation, which has spiked under his leadership, by 2030. The pledges were met with protests from climate strikers across the world demanding immediate action instead of \"empty promises.\" \"You need to accept that the era of fossil fuels is over,\"\u00a0said Xiye Bastida, a youth climate activist from Mexico, addressing the\u00a0leaders on Thursday. \"We demand that you stop systematically targeting the Global South \u2014 and Black, brown and indigenous communities \u2014 through environmental plunder.\" The US has dirtied the atmosphere with carbon dioxide more than any other economy and its citizens have some of the highest carbon footprints in the world today. Though the 50% target announced on Thursday\u00a0is not binding, it raises the US\u00a0commitment to cutting emissions by about a third. World leaders in 2015 promised to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures in a bid to hold off the worst effects of climate change. But as recently as November, a United Nations report found their official plans to achieve this were \" woefully inadequate .\" \"More would be needed to meet the 1.5-degree limit,\" said NewClimate Institute director Niklas H\u00f6hne, referring to the new US emissions goal. While more ambitious climate targets are \"very encouraging indeed,\" said Prakash Kashwan, a professor of political science\u00a0who researches climate justice at the University of Connecticut. Big emitters like the US and EU should explicitly recognize the carbon debt they owe the rest of the world instead of using their domestic actions to cajole other countries. \"Lead from the front by delivering actual emission reductions.\" The 40 world leaders who met virtually for Biden's two-day summit are responsible for 80% of the yearly greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet and wreaking havoc in the form of worse droughts, cyclones, floods, heatwaves and wildfires. As well as the big polluters, leaders from some of the countries least responsible but most vulnerable to climatic shifts also attended, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jamaica and Bangladesh. Some countries announced steeper cuts in the run-up to the meeting, which is seen as a critical milestone on the road to the COP26 UN climate summit to be held in Glasgow, UK, in November. Climate change is making wildfires more intense in rich, polluting countries like the US and Australia Increasingly heavy floods in Bangladesh put one-third of the country under water last year On Tuesday, the UK set the world's most ambitious target with a law binding the country to cut greenhouse gas emissions 78% by 2035 from 1990 levels. The goal includes emissions from ships and flights abroad that have traditionally been ignored by domestic governments. Later that evening, EU lawmakers reached a legally binding deal to make the bloc's climate goal \u2014 to cut net greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels.\u00a0The target is less ambitious than the 60% the European Parliament had previously voted for. US climate envoy John Kerry met his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua in Shanghai last week as part of a renewed push in US climate diplomacy . But while they agreed to discuss concrete actions this decade to cut carbon pollution, they did not announce more ambitious pledges. \"For low- middle-income countries, we need to see both China and the US are committing,\" said Marcelo Mena-Carrasco, director of the Climate Action Center at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso and a former Chilean environment minister. \"That's a way to see the global burden of emissions is taken care of.\" A similar trip to India also failed to yield stronger commitments. During the meeting, the Indian Foreign Ministry stressed the need for rich countries to fulfill their unmet pledge to send $100 billion (\u20ac120 billion) a year in climate finance to poorer countries by 2020. The call was repeated by several world leaders at the summit. The transition from coal to wind and solar energy has been slowed by lobby groups and subsidies to fossil fuel companies As part of an executive order in his first days in office, Biden announced a new climate plan \u2014 released during the summit \u2014 on how the United States will work with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to help poorer countries cut their emissions and protect ecosystems. But even delivering on that promise may not be enough to convince poorer countries to give up fossil fuels their economies so heavily rely on. \"Climate finance is such a small bucket it doesn't support transformational changes,\" said Jennifer Tollmann, a senior policy advisor at Berlin-based climate think tank E3G.\u00a0 Speaking on the second day of the summit, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called on governments and businesses to adopt policies that will make it faster and cheaper to transition away from fossil fuels. \"Leaders will need to reward those that take difficult steps.\" Biden also used\u00a0the summit to portray the US as a global leader in the fight against climate change. Its reputation had suffered under the administration of his predecessor Donald Trump, who in addition to taking the US out of the international Paris Agreement also rolled back environmental laws while promoting coal, oil and gas. The US \"has offered nothing on how it plans to make up for the lost four years,\" said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian at a press conference on Friday. \"Its return is by no means a glorious comeback but rather the student playing truant getting back to class.\" Chinese Premier Xi Jinping surprised the world in September by announcing that China would peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2060. But it has since continued to invest in fossil fuel projects, particularly to build coal-fired power plants across Asia. South Korea, meanwhile,\u00a0announced at the summit that it\u00a0will stop funding coal plants overseas. As well as finances and emissions, the summit also hosted sessions on jobs, climate security, adaptation and nature-based solutions that include further efforts to stop deforestation. A report published Tuesday by the Rainforest Foundation Norway found that none of the five countries with the biggest rainforests \u2014 Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Peru, and Colombia \u2014 have committed in their emissions plans to end deforestation by 2030, despite\u00a0having agreed to do so. A common frustration among activists and scientists watching the talks was the lack of commitment to immediate action. \"We have been having the same song with other leaders, so we are tired of empty promises,\" said Kevin Mtai, a climate activist with student protest group Fridays for Future in Kenya, adding that Biden should immediately stop US-headquartered fossil fuel companies causing environmental problems in the Global South. \"We need action not later but right now, because the planet is dying.\" The protesters' symbol was a clock to signal to those meeting at the United Nations climate change conference (COP24) that time is running out if the world is to limit global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Negotiations at the COP have been tough, with disagreements on financing for developing countries and on how states should report their emissions cuts. Some marchers made giant puppets, including of Brazil's president elect, Jair Messias Bolsonaro, to protest the leader's climate policies. Bolsonaro has threatened to follow US President Donald Trump and withdraw his country from the Paris climate agreement. Bolsonaro has also talked about loosening protections for the Amazon rainforest \u2014 the Earth's green lungs. About seven million people worldwide die prematurely due to air pollution every year. Poland's air quality is particularly bad because of the country's dependence on coal for electricity and heating. Some protesters decorated pollution masks to make a statement about Poland's coal policy. During the COP, the country's president said there was no intention to phase out coal. Some groups, like the International Atomic Energy Agency, are promoting nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. It would provide a stable and greenhouse gas-emission-free energy source, says the IAEA. A number of protesters turned up to advocate against nuclear, because there is no good way to deal with the radioactive waste it produces and because it is potentially unsafe, they say. Sustaina Claus arrived at the climate march with his Christmas elves to preach the message of sustainability. The environmental activist says we need to stop overconsumption if we are to stop climate change and protect the planet's resources. Instead of buying mountains of gifts for your loved ones at Christmas, \"you should give the gift of you.\" NGOs said a number of environmental campaigners were refused entry at the Polish border or deported from the country, having been deemed a \"threat\" to national security. Climate Action Network, an umbrella group of climate groups, called the actions worrying. A spokeswoman for Poland's border guards said she could not say whether the refusals were connected to the COP, according to Reuters. Climate activist Lander Wantens cycled over 1,000 kilometers from Belgium to Katowice for the protest and to deliver a message to delegates to do more to combat climate change. He hopes that if the negotiators see \"four guys from Belgium are crazy enough to bike to the climate summit in Poland in winter, maybe that's a signal that they have to work on an ambitious climate agreement.\" Author: Jennifer Collins, Louise Osborne This article was\u00a0updated throughout the summit. \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Biden climate summit: New pledges to cut emissions still fall short", "article_name": "new-climate-pledges-to-cut-emissions-still-fall-short", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/new-climate-pledges-to-cut-emissions-still-fall-short/a-57284816", "date_published": "2021-04-23 00:00:00", "article_length": 11244, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:00:50.124643"}

Despite the fact most of us are in the high-risk category, 75 new [Omas for Future] groups were founded around Germany during the pandemic. These are women that go every week onto the streets. They don't meet to drink coffee, they plan campaigns, network, think about how to reach and inform people.

This gives courage to the children, too.\"\u00a0 Cordula Weimann, founder of Omas for Future (Grannies for Future) Law is a mechanism to channel frustration, says academic Joana Setzer \"If you have the science telling you what the problem is, but you also see inconsistency or insufficient action from those who have the power to address it, then the law is a mechanism to channel that frustration. It has been really interesting to witness the several ways in which the law is being used: countries across the world passing climate laws, many with measurable mitigation and adaptation targets, and courts enforcing those laws and telling governments and corporations that they have a duty of care \u2014 as in the lawsuit filed by [Dutch non-profit] Urgenda against the Dutch government and the lawsuit filed by Friends of the Earth Netherlands against Shell.\"\u00a0 Joana Setzer, assistant professor\u00a0at the Grantham Research Institute\u00a0specializing in climate litigation and global environmental governance 'We can unite and build better systems,' says Leah Thomas, an intersectional environmentalist \" Gen Z gives me a lot of hope \u2014 seeing the younger generation just get it across political lines. In the US, even younger conservatives understand that climate is an important issue and I think that there's now so many conversations about identity and how that intersects with environmentalism.

There's so many people talking about this internationally and this gives me hope: People believe that what happens in Africa will not only stay in Africa. I am part of a group fighting for the protection of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. I have never been there, but I know it is responsible for regulating temperatures on the planet.

For Germany, that meant an estimated 3,500 tons of plastic waste saved. In Amsterdam, the taboo on home pyrotechnics looks set to endure, with the city organizing public displays instead. Europe and North America saw plunging temperatures, with many regions blanketed in deep snow. Arctic warming caused dips in the polar vortex and a weaker jet stream, conspiring to send chilly Arctic air south. Disruption of the jet stream can also have the reverse effect, sending warm air up from the tropics. We're yet to see which trend will dominate as the planet continues to heat up. Thousands of people had to leave their homes after heavy rain flooded towns in eastern Australia. Gladys Berejiklian, then the premier of New South Wales, a state that was particularly affected, called the inundation a \"one-in-100-year event.\" Some commentators argued that this kind of flooding is in fact becoming the new normal. Europe's biggest economy was given a reality check by its Constitutional Court, which declared the German Climate Protection Act unconstitutional for failing to include climate targets beyond 2030. The court said this would place too great a burden on future generations. The Bundestag toughened up the legislation with a commitment to go climate-neutral by 2045. In another landmark ruling, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered Shell to cut its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was the first time a private company has been legally forced to comply with the global agreement. \"This applies to the entire world, so also to Shell,\" the judge said. More than 230 people died during a heat wave in Canada, with record temperatures of nearly 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) recorded in Lytton, British Columbia. The following day, forest fires reduced much of the village to ash. This was also a summer of devastating blazes for California, Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey, and Siberia and the Amazon. In Central Europe, catastrophic heavy rain turned streams into raging rivers that inundated towns and villages as they burst their banks. In Germany's Rhineland, more than 180 people lost their lives. Parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also suffered extreme floods. Property damage in Germany alone was estimated at several billion euros. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report with an unequivocal message: The climate crisis is worse than we thought and humans are definitely to blame. The IPCC's assessment reports are the most detailed and comprehensive on the topic, in this case drawing on more than 14,000 peer-reviewed studies. At the UN General Assembly, Premier Xi Jinping announced that China would no longer build coal-fired power plants abroad \u2014 putting an end to a construction spree that has already seen hundreds of Chinese-backed coal power projects go up as part of its Belt and Road Initiative through Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. But Beijing continues to build new coal power plants at home. Concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere reached a new record in 2020. According to the report by the World Meteorological Organization, the year-on-year increase was higher than the average increase over the past decade, despite the economic fallout of the pandemic. The WMO announced the figures with the warning that \"we are way off track\" for the Paris Agreement targets. After a pandemic hiatus, the UN Climate Change Conference was back in 2021, but it struggled to decide the details of the Glasgow Climate Pact. With India and China resisting a commitment to phase out coal, the final text agreed only to a \"phasedown.\" For many, this was hugely disappointing, though not necessarily surprising. Greta Thunberg had already declared COP26 \"a global greenwash festival.\" With the year drawing to a close, the US was hit by more extreme weather as 36 tornadoes swept through six states and left devastation in their wake. Homes and businesses were demolished, while dozens of people were killed. President Biden announced an investigation into global heating's impact on the tornadoes. Soonafter, nearly 400 people died in the Philippines after Typhoon Rai hit. Author: Jeannette Cwienk Ice is melting around the world, with drastic consequences for humanity.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change has made the biggest jump towards the top of a monthly survey of German sentiment. Despite a 16 percentage point drop, asylum policy remained the chief concern for most Germans, according to the poll. Asylum policy and climate change are the top concerns for Germans, according to the DeutschlandTrend poll published on Thursday. Nearly a third of all respondents said immigration was the most pressing issue for Germany, marking a 16 percentage point drop. Meanwhile, climate change shot up the list, rising 18 percentage points to 27% of respondents. Climate protests such as the youth-driven Fridays for Future\u00a0have prompted greater focus on the man-made destabilization of Earth's climate . Other concerns included education, social injustice and mobility. Security, crime and terrorism were at the bottom of the list with 6% of respondents describing them as pressing issues.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, remained at the top of the list with 27%, marking an increase of two percentage points. The Green Party was in second with 23% of respondents saying they would back them if polls were held on Sunday. The far-right Alternative for Germany came in third with a percentage point drop to 14%. The center-left Social Democrats, junior coalition partners once considered the main opposition party in Germany, have remained unchanged with 13% support.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change denial has been rampant in conservative America, but something is shifting. A growing movement is advocating for climate action \u2014 in its own fossil fuel-friendly way. American Conservation Coalition activists took part in a recent cleanup in Florida In February, 25 Republican lawmakers got together in Utah, to meet youth party members and environmental groups and brainstorm a conservative approach to tackling the climate crisis. But it was something of a clandestine meeting,with some politicians only attending\u00a0after organizers promised they would stay anonymous.\u00a0 That's how sensitive this subject still is in the Republican Party post-Trump. The former president called human-caused\u00a0climate change \"a hoax,\" withdrew from the Paris Agreement and railed against water-conserving showerheads that failed\u00a0to keep his hair perfect.\u00a0 Donald Trump was more worried about his hairdo than climate change But as younger voters in particular demand a response to the crisis, things are changing, said\u00a0Chris Barnard of the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), a group of young conservatives that helped organize the gathering in Salt Lake City. \"If they want to stay relevant, they need our vote,\" said the 23-year-old.\u00a0 When John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, formed a Conservative Climate Caucus in June, almost a third of his fellow party House members signed up. In the midst of a summer of extreme heat and wildfires , they declared that the \"climate is changing,\" acknowledging that the prosperity of industrialization has come at a price. Too often, Republicans simply have opposed climate solutions without putting forward any ideas of their own, Curtis told reporters. \"We, too, want to leave this Earth better than we found it.\"\u00a0 Right before Earth Day in April, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican,\u00a0presented a plan to capture carbon , plant trees and expand nuclear energy. A few weeks later, he created a Republican task force to develop a climate and energy agenda.\u00a0 Among Republicans younger than 40, a majority is concerned about the changing climate, opinion polls show . By contrast, 65% of Republican baby boomers have said climate change was not an important concern to them.\u00a0 This age gap was illustrated in Miami in June, when the ACC held a rally dubbed \"the first conservative climate protest in the US.\" Speakers had to shout over heckling by a group of older men who waved signs reading: \"There is no climate crisis.\" ACC head Benji Backer (right) met with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez at the 'first-ever conservative climate rally' in June Staunch climate denial is still seen in the rhetoric of Republican lawmakers, too. When large parts of Texas lost power in frigid weather last winter , Republican Governor Greg Abbott falsely blamed solar and wind energy. And when President Joe Biden announced his goal of cutting greenhouse emissions in half at a climate summit earlier this year, some Republicans and right-wing media stoked resistance by spreading misinformation suggesting the president planned to restrict meat consumption. But if the thought of giving up burgers is a turnoff for many Americans, the ACC believes there are ways to frame climate action more positively for the GOP's supporters.\u00a0 Barnard points to the promises of innovation and emphasizing conservation of wildlife and natural resources,\u00a0a long-time interest of many farmers and hunters in rural America. \"A lot of Americans want to be positive. They don't want to feel guilty for the collapse of the planet,\" he said. Most climate-conscious conservatives emphasize investment in new technology to reduce emissions, regulatory reform to allow easier development of clean energy projects\u00a0and so-called natural climate solutions \u2014 using soil, trees and grassland to capture and store carbon. \"We need to empower market action, scientists and entrepreneurs, rather than expect the government to throw money at the problem,\" Barnard said. Younger conservatives, like those who make up The Conservation Coalition, can't ignore the climate crisis Some Republicans have said they support carbon pricing and many favor\u00a0nuclear energy. But most insist fossil fuels still have a role to play in the energy system. Curtis wants the United States to export gas to China to replace coal, which is heavier on carbon emissions. \"Reducing emissions is the goal, not reducing energy choices,\" he proclaimed\u00a0in the founding statement of his caucus.\u00a0 On the other side the aisle, some Democrats suspect their Republican colleagues of \"greenwashing,\" \u00a0of\u00a0promoting\u00a0solutions as good for the environment when they really aren't.\u00a0Although both parties receive campaign contributions from the oil and gas sector, \"the vast majority\" of this funding goes to Republicans , according to researchers at Open Secrets, a research and government transparency group. Republicans in Congress are against\u00a0Biden's climate plan to phase out fossil fuels. And many climate scientists are also skeptical about the solutions conservatives have proposed. Planting trees and carbon sequestration will not be enough, according to Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"There are limits to how much we can rely on these natural carbon sinks,\" she said. \"That's why we have to get to the core of the problem, which is fossil fuel dependence. We cannot get distracted.\"\u00a0 Scientists also point out that purely market-based efforts to cut emissions have often failed to make an impact. \"The US is making some significant progress in the direction of cutting emissions. Almost all that progress is not coming from the market, but from mechanisms that are in place through regulation,\" said David Victor, director of the Deep Decarbonization Initiative at the University of California San Diego.\u00a0 And Cleetus isn't impressed by comparisons with China. \"I think this is not a moment where responsible nations can point at each other and try to evade responsibility,\" she said.\u00a0 Barnard said there is no \"perfect silver bullet\" to fight climate change. \"One of the frustrations we have is that a lot of the young people with the progressive climate movement make the perfect the enemy of the good.\" Rather than disparaging policies that don't rapidly eliminate fossil fuels, he\u00a0said we should welcome steps in the right direction. Could ever-more frequent wildfires \u2014 like those in California this summer \u2014 put climate change beyond party politics? In Coral Gables, Florida, 43-year-old Republican Mayor Vince Lago is showing what such steps might look like. He passed legislation requiring new buildings to be energy efficient and expedited the approval process for solar panel permits.\u00a0 His city of 51,000 residents employs one of Florida's largest electric car fleets, and Lago himself lives in a home that runs on solar energy. He also\u00a0drives an electric BMW i3 subcompact car \u2014 \"bought used,\" he stressed\u00a0\u2014 charged by his own solar panels. The mayor said he often invites residents to his home to answer questions about solar energy. His close-to-zero electricity bill proves environmental policies can be financially savvy, too, he said. \"When we elected officials lead by example, when you're showing that you're walking the walk, not just talking, people have more faith in their government.\" Another thing that might improve public perception of politicians' handling of the crisis would be an end to partisan bickering.\u00a0 \"As you talk about sea-level rise, global warming, deforestation and the destruction of our fish hatcheries and our water quality, I think eventually this is no longer going to be party politics as usual,\" Lago predicts. \"This is not really an issue about conservatives or liberals, Democrats or Republicans. This is an issue about our future.\" Many regions in Russia have been burning for weeks, with the area around Yakutia in the far northeast having been hit particularly hard. The authorities have counted more than 250 fires currently burning across Russia, covering a total area of more than 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres). But it's not just the fires that are causing problems for locals. Dense smoke has been drifting across populated areas, for example the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. This is especially hard for the elderly and children, as it's nearly impossible to breathe outside. Evacuees on a ferry at the port of Pefki, Euboea \u2014 they are embarking on a journey into the unknown, as their homes and belongings will probably be destroyed by the time they return. For the first time since the forest fires started on the Greek island of Euboea at the beginning of last week, massive air missions are now being flown to fight the fires. Eyewitnesses report apocalyptic scenes. But not everyone is fleeing \u2014 many local residents want to support the firefighters. At times, that can include desperate acts \u2014 such as with this man, who\u2019s trying to beat out flames with a tree branch. Such autonomous actions are causing a major problem for the authorities, as through them, many people are placing themselves in grave danger. Besides Greece and Italy, Turkey is also struggling with devastating fires. Walls of fire are spreading from the forests to residential areas. On this photo, Turkish firefighters are trying to stop a blaze near Cokertme that threatens to spread into buildings. More than 150,000 hectares \u2014 including entire villages \u2014 have already fallen victim to the flames in Turkey. More than 5,700 fires are currently raging in the West Coast state of California \u2014 and the typical wildfire season there has not even started yet. The Dixie Fire is now the second-largest in the state's history, and completely destroyed the town of Greenville. In this photo, a fire crew member keeps an eye out for spot fires to slow the wildfire near the town of Westwood. In California, whirlwinds of ash and embers, such as this one that meandered through the Santa Barbara hills, are complicating matters. West Coast fires have even been creating their own weather. With the situation more devastating than in previous years, governors of affected states have turned to Washington for help \u2014 they are urgently seeking more emergency staff and firefighting aircraft.

{"id": null, "body": "     The UN climate panel has issued its strongest ever warning about global warning. The German government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead. Drought will become more likely as climate change accelerates The German government has announced a 255 million euro ($330.7 million) boost for research into preventing climate change. This comes as the UN climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released in Paris on Friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. It also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters (11 to 17 inches). German Research Minister Annette Schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years. It will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the German climate change calculation center. Technological solutions The melting of ice in the Arctic is set to accelerate, endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding Schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming. \"To keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed,\" she said. The minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs. \"This program will be forward-looking in that it offers technological solutions for the growing economies of our world,\" Schavan said. \"We will also open up new markets for our economy.\" More heat waves and violent cyclones Other projections made by the IPCC report include the increasing likelihood of heat waves and violent tropical cyclones, as well as the melting of the Artic sea ice in summer by 2100. The document was much more forceful than its last report in judging whether humans were to blame for climate change. It said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years. In 2001, it said the link was 66 percent probable. \"If you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system, the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light, because you can see what the costs of inaction are,\" IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri told delegates in Paris. Humans to blame The UN wants governments to cut down on the use of fossil fuels The head of the UN Environment Program Achim Steiner said Friday would be remembered as the day when the question mark was removed from whether people are to blame for climate change. Steiner, whose agency oversees the operation of the Kyoto protocol, urged governments to put more effort into getting stalled talks on long-term cuts in carbon dioxide emissions back on track. No post-2012 targets have yet been set. It is hoped that the United States, the world's top emitter of greenhouse gases, will, in particular, do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants, factories and cars. The US pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy. US President George W. Bush was also critical of the decision to exclude developing nations from the targets during the first phase of the agreement. China's booming industry is not bound by Kyoto. EU vow to cut emissions Cars are also a contributor to rising carbon dioxide emissions Germany has already vowed to make cutting emissions a central aim during its six-month EU presidency. The German environmental ministry also responded to the news of today's report saying the European Union should continue to push for industrialized nations, including the EU, to agree to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to1990 levels. \"Climate change is a reality that can't be challenged,\" said German Deputy Environment Minister Michael M\u00fcller. \"It is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps. The report confirms the necessity of an ambitious climate policy.\" Chancellor Angela Merkel has, however, recently come under fire for apparently backtracking on her pledge to tackle global warming and speaking out against blanket emission levels for new cars. German Chancellor Merkel said she would resist attempts from the EU Commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc. (29.01.2007)\n\u00a0 Europe needs to take the lead on tackling climate change and develop a unified strategy for when the Kyoto Protocol expires, German Chancellor Merkel after a meeting with British Prime Minister Blair. (04.11.2006)\n\u00a0 Germany will take the reins of both the G8 and the European Union next year and Angela Merkel has made battling climate change her top priority. But the chancellor will face the tough task of bringing the US in line.

{"id": null, "body": "     Amid dire warnings that time is quickly running out, delegates in Glasgow are set to make further binding pledges to radically reduce emissions. But without the funds to help countries adapt, they won't be much use. Climate protesters have not let up in their demands for change Climate experts have stressed that the upcoming UN climate conference, COP26, is the \"last, best chance\" for the world to come through with a plan to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) and help countries move to net-zero \u00a0emissions. Managing the green transition and heading off the worst effects of climate change won't be an easy task, neither in terms of policy, nor coming up with the necessary funds to make sure these promises have a chance of success. \"Finance is essential to accelerating the transition to net-zero and achieving the full ambition of the Paris Agreement,\" said Mark Carney, the COP26 finance adviser to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in the lead-up to the pivotal summit. The COP26 website lays it out in stark terms : \"To achieve our climate goals, every company, every financial firm, every bank, insurer and investor will need to change.\" Developing nations trying to transform their carbon-based economies and find ways to adapt will be looking for the world's richest nations, which\u00a0are responsible for most of the global carbon dioxide emissions, to make good on an overdue promise of $100 billion (roughly \u20ac86.2 billion) a year to help them fund\u00a0climate finance. And that's just the tip of the rapidly melting iceberg. Negotiations at COP26 will be focusing on raising even more money after 2025 because $100 billion isn't nearly enough,\u00a0according to Pablo Vieira, global director of the NDC Partnership , which helps countries achieve their national climate commitments. \"It needs to be considerably more. How are we going to get there if we can't deliver on the easier pledge that has been around for a long time?\" But as\u00a0of 2019, the last year for which data is available, wealthy nations had yet to even meet their original goal, contributing just under $80 billion according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Estimates from the UN, World Bank and the OECD have shown\u00a0 it will take $6.9 trillion every year until 2030 to meet the world's climate and development objectives. And that was published in 2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Vieira said even though the original $100 billion isn't enough, it's still crucial that it be met because it will help developing countries unlock additional funds from other sources like international climate funds, development banks and the private sector. \"The $100 billion is almost symbolic, and even being symbolic, it's not being met,\" said Maria Laura Rojas, executive director of the Bogota-based environment nonprofit Transforma and part of\u00a0 ACT2025 , a global group aiming to inform the UN climate talks. \"So, you start to see how that gets really frustrating for developing countries.\" \" Climate finance is going to be one of the big issues [at COP26], because it's about confidence building,\" said Simon Wilson, head spokesperson for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) . He said a failure to come through with the funding pledges would \"undermine trust\" in the rest of the negotiations. \"The whole idea of the Paris Agreement was to have this mutual agreement that everyone would make these commitments and ramp up their ambition over time. But to get developing countries to do that, they need to have the confidence that there will be support for them.\" The Philippines , for example, is aiming for a 75% emissions cut by 2030 \u2014 but its national climate plan has said the country can\u00a0only achieve about 3 percentage points of that commitment on its own. And at a meeting with international climate envoys in Johannesburg at the end of September, South Africa said it would need billions of dollars to replace its polluting coal power plants \u00a0\u2014\u00a0which produce 80% of the country's power\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with clean energy. \"While South Africa is committed to a just transition, we need certainty and predictability [of financing] \u2026 to accelerate this transition,\" said the environment department. \"We do need an irrevocable agreement that we can sign at COP26 where our commitments, as all parties, are clear.\" As Mining and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe pointed out at a mining conference a few days later, \"We are not a developed economy:\u00a0We don't have all alternative sources.\" Coal power plants still account for 80% of South Africa's power \"It's difficult to make those long-term plans unless you have some idea of what's going to be available to you in terms of in terms of finance,\" said Wilson. He said the GCF has also increasingly focused on making sure adaptation efforts in the least-developed regions in Africa, or island nations in the Pacific and Caribbean, are getting their fair share of cash. For its part, the GCF has allocated over half its funding for adaptation projects, among them sustainable agriculture in Thailand and water security for communities in Kenya. At an emergency summit in Milan , Italy, at the end of September, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0stressed the need for predictable funding for developing nations, 50% of which would be earmarked for\u00a0\"adaptation and resilience\" to the climate crisis. \"Adaptation needs are increasing every year,\" he said. \"Developing countries already need $70 billion for adaptation, and that figure could more than quadruple to $300 billion a year by the end of this decade.\" For the most part, he said, those funds should come from grants, which do not have to be paid back. Recent data from the OECD\u00a0showed that just a quarter of the nearly $80 billion committed in 2019 was for adaptation, with Asia and Africa benefiting from more than two-thirds of the funds. Most of the remaining\u00a0funds went toward mitigation efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \"Adaptation activities will require grant funding because they will not generate revenue,\" said GCF spokesperson Wilson. \"They're about protecting people from the devastating impacts of extreme weather, or climate change leading to sea level rise, or flooding and drought. And it will always be difficult to do that.\" Locusts, boosted by drought, heavy rains and warm temperatures, have devastated crops in East Africa. Pesticides can help, though they're not exactly environmentally friendly. Scientists in Nairobi have experimented with fungi and other microbes to make safer poisons. They've also used the locusts' unique smell, which changes as they mature, to break up swarms and even drive them to cannibalism. Wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity worldwide, and Africa is no exception. In Botswana, firefighters are learning the age-old techniques of Australia's northern Indigenous people. They prevent bigger fires by preemptively burning away grass and dry leaves, preserving biodiversity and reducing CO2 emissions. Angola, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique could also benefit. People in Zimbabwe are also looking to the past to plan for the future. Faced with flooding linked to climate change, some are reviving ngazi, traditional thatched homes on stilts. These elevated structures, about 2 meters (6.5 feet) above the ground, are making a comeback along the Zambezi River. They protect inhabitants from floods while keeping them cooler than brick homes. Namibia is one of southern Africa's most arid countries, and it's expecting longer, more intense droughts in the future. Windhoek, with more than 400,000 people, has already anticipated that problem. Back in 1968, the city installed the word's first water recycling plant, reclaiming sewage for drinking water in a 10-step process. Expanded in 2002, it continues to deliver a reliable water supply. Maps are crucial for helping communities prepare for increased risks of flooding, landslides and storms linked to climate change. And, yet, many African maps are rarely updated \u2014 even in urban areas, where rapid unplanned growth can stay hidden for years. Drones can help planners get an updated view, while machine learning uses satellite data to develop risk maps for cities and agricultural areas. Hydroponics, raising plants without soil, has allowed some farmers to grow crops with very little water or space. It's a great option for Africa's arid regions, but such setups require a constant supply of electricity \u2014 not ideal in places with frequent power outages. Two mechanical engineering students in South Africa have designed a new pipe system that only requires power for four hours a day. Farms in low-lying areas such as Egypt's Nile Delta are threatened by rising seas and salty water. Some people have begun to look to China (above) for ideas on how to raise fish and grow plants in the same space. Aquaponics helps preserve scarce fresh water, and crops benefit from fish waste fertilizer. To adapt, researchers are looking for plants and fish species more suited to brackish water. Author: Martin Kuebler Ahead of\u00a0COP26, NDC Partnership,\u00a0with the support of the German government, has helped 67 countries update their long-term goals to reduce emissions known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Global director Vieira said they've noticed a substantial shift in the focus on adaptation. He added, however, that funding adaptation projects was more challenging, as it wasn't so easy for potential investors to see the end goal, as compared with lowering emissions. \"It's clear that the majority of [global] funding is going to renewables projects rather than going to adaptation,\" said Wilson, pointing out that it's easier to attract investors with single large-scale projects like solar plants, for example, which can guarantee a profit, rather than efforts to plan for the wide-ranging health impacts of a climate change. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has proposed a Resilience and Sustainability Trust that will offer up to $50 billion in funding to help low-income countries \"build economic resilience and sustainability\" in the face of both climate change and pandemics. The goal is to \"help countries transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient, smart, inclusive economies,\" said IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, adding that\u00a0climate\u00a0will be more fully integrated into IMF lending programs.\u00a0 Wilson, Vieira and Rojas were cautiously optimistic about recent moves by the Biden administration and other world leaders to increase their funding pledges . But they stressed that much more needed to be done \u2014 including bringing in the private sector and making funds easier to access for smaller players on the regional and local level.\u00a0 Rojas said there was still \"a lot of work\" ahead,\u00a0not just in terms of providing climate finance\u00a0but also in making sure governments and investors move away from supporting fossil fuel. \"When you look at how much money is flowing into climate action, you might get a little bit hopeful. But then when you look at what's still flowing to fossil fuels and exploration and extraction, that really needs to change or else we're not doing what needs to be done.\" A wildfire that burned through at least 7,780 hectares (30 square miles) in about a week and devastated forests in southern Spain was brought under control thanks to steady rains. The downpour helped the firefighters, who were backed by some 50 aircrafts. The blaze was one of the most difficult to combat in recent times in Spain. Some 2,600 people were forced to flee their homes. Unprecedented flooding \u2014 caused by two months' worth of rainfall in two days \u2014 has resulted in devastating damage in central Europe, leaving at least 226 people dead in Germany and Belgium. Narrow valley streams swelled into raging floods in the space of hours, wiping out centuries-old communities. Rebuilding the ruined homes, businesses and infrastructure is expected to cost billions of euros. While half of Europe is drowning, elsewhere areas are going up in flames: Large fires raged, particularly in Greece, Italy and Turkey. They have caused unforeseeable monetary damage, while thousands of people in Europe have lost their homes and their belongings. In addition to deadly wildfires, Italy also battled record heat temperatures, with the Italian Health Ministry issuing the maximum possible heat warning level for many cities. On the island of Sicily, 48.8 degrees Celsius (almost 120 degrees Fahrenheit) was measured on August 11 \u2014 a new European heat record. The heat could make existing fires worse, or lead to new ones. Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire continues smoldering in California. It's California's largest fire on record, and among the most destructive in the state's history \u2014 it wiped the town of Greenville off the map. Although it's about 60% contained, the fire continues to burn two months in. Meanwhile, hot and dry conditions continue in the region, spreading fears of more fire. Earlier this summer, record floods also hit parts of India and central China, overwhelming dams and drains and flooding streets. The downpours have been particularly heavy, even for the rainy season. Scientists have predicted that climate change will lead to more frequent and intense rainfall \u2014 warmer air holds more water, creating more rain. As nations flood in northern Europe, Mediterranean countries like Greece were in the grip of several heat waves. In the first week of July, temperatures soared to 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit). Tourism hot spots like the Acropolis were forced to shut during the day, while the extreme heat also sparked forest fires outside Thessaloniki, which helicopters tried to douse. \"It is an unprecedented reality in Sardinia\u2019s history,\" said Sardinia's Governor Christian Salinas of the ongoing wildfires that have scorched the historic central western area of Montiferru. \"So far, 20,000 hectares of forest that represent centuries of environmental history of our island have gone up in ashes.\" Around 1,500 people were evacuated from the island by the end of July. Intense heat is becoming more common, as seen in late June in the US states of Washington and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Scorching temperatures under a \"heat dome,\" hot air trapped for days by high pressure fronts, caused hundreds of heat-related deaths. The village of Lytton recorded a high of 49.6 Celsius (121 Fahrenheit) \u2014 and burned to the ground the next day. Heat and drought are fueling one of the most intense wildfire seasons in the West Coast and Pacific Northwest regions. Oregon's Bootleg Fire, which burned an area the size of Los Angeles in just two weeks, was so big it created its own weather and sent smoke all the way to New York City. A recent study said the weather conditions would have been \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. To the south, central Brazil is suffering its worst drought 100 years, increasing the risk of fires and further deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Researchers recently reported that a large swath of the southeastern Amazon has flipped from absorbing to emitting planet-warming CO2 emissions, pushing the rainforest closer to a \"tipping point.\" After years of unrelenting drought, more than 1.14 million people in Madagascar are food-insecure, with some now forced to eat raw cactus, wild leaves and roots, and locusts in famine-like conditions. With the absence of natural disaster, crop failure or political conflict, the dire situation in the African nation is said to be first famine in modern history caused solely by climate change. The number of people fleeing conflict and natural disasters hit a 10-year high in 2020, with a record 55 million people relocating within their own country. That's in addition to some 26 million people who fled across borders. A joint report released by refugee monitors in May found that three-quarters of the internally displaced were victims of extreme weather \u2014 and that number is likely to grow.

{"id": null, "body": "     The death toll following the devastating flooding in western Germany has risen above 150. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany will \"stand up to this force of nature.\" This article was last updated at 22:22\u00a0UTC Hannah Cloke, hydrology expert and professor at Reading University, told public broadcaster ZDF that there had been warnings about the extreme rains days before they hit.\u00a0 But the warning chain \"broke\" somewhere along the way and the warnings did not reach everyone. A spokesperson for the German Meteorological Service (DWD) defended its role saying the agency had \"done what it was supposed to do.\" The DWD warned local authorities of the expected weather pattern, but often these messages were not passed on, the spokesperson told ZDF. In Germany, local districts are responsible for deciding relevant measures, not the DWD. Cloke said that a unified, national approach was necessary, adding that local authorities often lack the necessary resources to properly deal with such issues. The city hall of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv lit up in the colors of the German flag\u00a0\u2014 black, red and gold\u00a0\u2014 on Sunday to show support for those \"affected by the devastating floods.\" The mayor of the city shared a photo of the building over Twitter. Police detained three people in the town of Eschweiler near the western German city of Aachen. They were charged with looting in one of the areas badly hit by the flooding. Armin Laschet, State Premier of North Rhine-Westphalia where the town is located, said on Sunday that he was \"furious\" to hear \"that people are returning to their devastated homes to find that looters have stolen what little they have left.\" His comments came during an interview with public broadcaster WDR. Armin Laschet, the State Premier of North Rhine-Westphalia and the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) told public broadcaster Westdeutscher Rundfunk on Sunday that \"a catastrophe on a national scale requires a swift national response.\" He said that he was working with colleagues on the state and national level to work out exactly what that response would be. But he also warned that the \"rebuilding will take months, if not years.\" Laschet hopes to\u00a0replace Angela Merkel as chancellor in September. During the interview, he\u00a0laid out what he considers necessary to avoid a repeat of the catastrophic flooding. \"We have to build dams, retention basins, reservoirs, to renaturalize land\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 protection not just along the Rhine, but also on the large and many small rivers all over the country,\" he told the broadcaster. Cologne police said in a statement on Sunday that they had managed to reach 700 people who had been declared missing. There are now just 150 people who they have not yet been able to get hold of in the regions around Cologne and Bonn. While looters had not proved to be a problem in the wake of the flooding, the police statement called for \"catastrophe tourists\" and onlookers to avoid the affected areas, saying that they were hindering rescue efforts. The police also found another body in the Rheinbach district, the statement said. With the cleanup effort underway, many survivors still do not know if they will ever be able to return to their homes. Flood survivor Vera David told DW that she spent over 24 hours waiting for the rescuers on the top floor of her now ruined home. When firefighters reached her group, they told them they would \"have to manage\" on their own. \"There are so many dead. It is unbelievable,\" she told DW. The German Meteorological Service (DWD) warned of continued heavy rains in southeastern Bavaria for Sunday evening into Monday morning. Although the rain is expected to die down, the service said it could not rule out flooding in some local areas. The DWD expected water levels to rise in the city of Passau on the Austrian border, where the Inn and Ilz rivers feed into the Danube. The rivers in Passau have already burst their banks putting some of the city's streets under water Local radio broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk also reported flood risk warnings for the Bavarian capital Munich and the surrounding areas. Germany's Finance Minister Olaf Scholz pledged immediate federal support of around \u20ac400 million ($472 million), based on the amount provided during previous floods. \"We're ready to do our part,\" he said, according to public broadcaster ARD. He had already said that more than \u20ac300 million would be needed immediately for people affected by the flooding in western Germany. The long-term costs could reach billions, he added. He also highlighted the importance of developing a climate neutral industry in Germany to avoid a repeat of the catastrophe. The full-scale of the damage caused by the flooding in Bavaria on Saturday is not yet known. Floods affected the southern state of Bavaria somewhat less than Germany's northwest German rail carrier Deutsche Bahn (DB) has said over 600 kilometers of tracks were damaged and 80 stops in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Rhineland-Palatinate have also been affected by water, mud and debris. Around 2,000 DB employees in the region have been working around the clock since Wednesday, the report added. DB said it expects long-distance services to return to normal for destinations in NRW at the start of the new week, but warned that commuters must still prepare for considerable restrictions. Bavarian Premier Markus S\u00f6der tweeted pictures during his visit to the region of Berchtesgadener Land. The conservative politician made the visit alongside the chancellor candidate for the German socialist party (SPD), Olaf Scholz. \"Within a few seconds people lost everything \u2014 first in the west and now here. Rapid help is needed in this crisis. Many thanks to all the rescue crews, you've done superhuman work,\" S\u00f6der wrote in his tweet. Premier S\u00f6der pledged to provide support for those affected by the flooding in the southeastern part of the state during a visit to the affected area on Sunday afternoon. Speaking in the town of Sch\u00f6nau am K\u00f6nigssee, S\u00f6der told reporters that the situation in Bavaria was \"very, very bad\" albeit not on the same scale as the \"catastrophe\" in western Germany. \"We won't leave anyone behind,\" he promised. The leader of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) also warned that Germany must accelerate its program of climate protection and adaptation. While such steps may be expensive, \"in the end of the costs of not doing anything, are much higher,\" S\u00f6der said. After arriving the town of Schuld, German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the situation in the flooded regions as \"surreal\" and \"terrifying.\" She pledged quick financial aid. \"Germany is a strong country,\" Merkel continued. \"We will stand up to this force of nature,\u00a0in the short term, but also in the medium and long term.\" \"We have to hurry up, we have to speed up the fight against climate change,\" Merkel said. What is needed is a policy \"that takes nature and the climate more into consideration than we have have done in recent years,\" she said. The chancellor also called on citizens for monetary donations for the affected communities. While rescuers still look for survivors, both local residents and volunteers from other parts of Germany are taking part in the cleanup process. Around 200 football fans from Cologne traveled to the region over the weekend to help clear the rubble, says DW's Kate Brady.\u00a0 Merkel and the Rhineland-Palatinate State Premier Malu Dreyer have vowed\u00a0close coordination between Germany's\u00a0federal and state governments.\u00a0 \"Because we can't do this alone,\" Dreyer said in a joint conversation with relief workers in Schuld.\u00a0\"It is quite great that the German chancellor is here today.\" The willingness of the local\u00a0population to help is very great, she added. Earlier, Merkel also visited the flood-hit region of Ahrweiler for the first time after returning from her final official visit to the United States. DW's Giulia Saudelli reports that some locals opted to make sandwiches for volunteers rather than watch the chancellor's walkabout. The chancellor went on a walkabout talking to locals upon her arrival in Schuld \"There is also a bit of skepticism here,\" our correspondent says. \"Some people I spoke to said they think it's more of a picture opportunity for the election campaign, rather than a visit that will actually bring something.\" \"Others are happy for this support. But what everyone tells me is that they want this support to last in the long term.\" The German Olympic team, made up of 80 athletes, held a minute of silence on Sunday to remember those who lost their lives in \u00a0the flooding disaster at their base in Tokyo. The German Olympics Sports Confederation, known by its German acronym DOSB, has already earmarked\u00a0\u00a0\u20ac100,000 ($118,000) in emergency funding. \"The floods are also significantly hurting sports clubs in the affected areas,\" said DOSB President Alfons H\u00f6rmann on Friday. The DOSB has launched an appeal to try and raise more money for the victims. The pope\u00a0appeared at St Peter's Square to bless Sunday worshippers for the first time since recovering from colon surgery two weeks ago.  The 84-year-old pontiff used his 14-minute address to pray for the people of Germany, Belgium\u00a0and the Netherlands who were\u00a0hit hardest. \"May the Lord receive the deceased and comfort the families,\" the Catholic leader told a crowd of hundreds of faithful outside the Vatican. One of Belgium's most famous chocolate factories is out of action. The Galler plant in Vaux-sous-Chevremont just outside Liege supplies the royal court of Philippe, the King of the Belgians. It has ground to a halt after a week of torrential rains swept through production lines, damaging machines and destroying ingredients. \"The priority now is to secure the factory and to get the electricity back on,\" said Valerie Stefenatto, the 32-year-old communications manager. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Galler pumped out 1,700 tonnes of chocolate every year. Germany's insurance industry has called on the country's politicians to re-examine\u00a0their policies on climate change after the devastating floods. \"In many places, adaptation to the consequences of climate change is being neglected,\" Joerg Asmussen, managing director of the German Insurance Association (GDV), told the Die Welt am Sonntag newspaper. Asmussen said buildings are still being erected in high-risk areas and there is a lack of investment in preventative measures. \"We have to change course here, otherwise a spiral of further catastrophes and increasing damage will be set in motion, which will first become expensive and then at some point unaffordable,\" he was quoted by the weekly newspaper as saying. New Israeli president Issac Herzog has written to his German counterpart, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to express \"our friendship and support of the German people in this time of destruction and loss.\" Aides to President Herzog said he told Steinmeier that \"Israel is a partner in any effort or initiative aimed at addressing this urgent challenge (of climate change).\" The colossal North Sea flood of February 1962 killed over 300 people and left tens of thousands in Germany's port city of Hamburg without shelter. It was a crucial turning point in the career of future Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, then interior minister of the city state. His handling of the crisis, particularly his decision to draft in soldiers to help, gained him nationwide popularity. The \"eternal chancellor\" was in the final phase of his tenure when he visited the eastern state of Brandenburg in 1997 after massive flooding along the River Oder. Sometimes dubbed the Einheitsflut, \"unity flood\", the disaster is often considered the first national crisis to test the solidarity between the newly reunified East and West Germanys. The fortunes of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der turned round when the rains fell in Saxony in the summer of 2002, when deadly floods affected Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. With his election campaign ailing, the Social Democrat chancellor donned wellington boots and portrayed himself as a crisis manager in the small eastern town of Grimma. He won the election by the barest of margins a month later.\u00a0 His opponent, Edmund Stoiber, chancellor candidate for the CDU/CSU, was caught cold by Schr\u00f6der's trip \u2013 he was actually on holiday in northern Germany when the disaster struck. He only arrived in the affected area a few days later, and complained bitterly of his competitor's \"flood tourism.\" Angela Merkel visited flood regions several times during her chancellorship. The first major flood of her tenure came in March and April 2006, again around the River Elbe in Saxony. The disaster struck just a few months after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in the US, when George W. Bush came under attack for failing to organize an adequate response. Merkel made sure to avoid the same criticism. Eastern and southern Germany were hit again by extreme floods in the summer of 2013, this time a few months before an election. The historic center of Dresden was threatened as the Elbe burst its banks in widespread flooding that hit much of Central Europe. Merkel visited affected regions in Saxony and Bavaria, promising federal aid.\u00a0 CDU chancellor candidate and premier of North Rhine-Westphalia cancelled all other appointments to visit the badly affected city of Hagen in his state. The political stakes are high, as the deadly floods are being linked to climate change, and Laschet has a reputation as a protector of the state's coal industry, which could potentially damage his campaign.\u00a0 The Social Democrat candidate Olaf Scholz also appeared in the neighboring state of Rhineland-Palatinate after the floods hit, alongside state premier and party colleague Malu Dreyer (SPD). Though his party is trailing in the polls a long way behind Armin Laschet's CDU, Scholz, as the current German finance minister, was able to promise immediate federal aid for the flood-stricken regions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the hard-hit village of Schuld in western Germany's Eifel region on July 18. She assured locals of her support and said she would visit again in August, ahead of the country's federal elections in September. Author: Ben Knight The town of Erftstadt, west of Cologne, remains closed off after some of the worst floods in living memory .  Several residents are still waiting for news of\u00a0their loved ones as authorities report that 59 people are still unaccounted for.  A spokesman for the Rhine-Erft district told the WDR broadcaster on Sunday that the breakdown of the local telephone network may explain why some people have been unable to be contacted. As many as 130 people were evacuated from their homes in the Bavarian district of Berchtesgadener Land close to the Austrian border in southern Germany. Officials told 80 people from Sch\u00f6nau am K\u00f6nigssee to leave their houses. District administrator Berhard Kern said the order was given due to \"geological problems\", but the Christian Social Union politician gave no further details. He added that roads in and around the area are \"extremely badly affected\" by the rising water levels.\u00a0 DW's Giulia Saudelli is reporting on the ground in the flood-hit village of Schuld, which has seen large areas destroyed by the extreme weather. \"One can see the devastation and destruction that the water has brought through the town,\" our correspondent says. \"Some of the houses that were closer to the river have been completely swept away. Houses futher back away from the water are destroyed up to the second floor; some are completely gutted and filled with mud and debris,\" she reports. Schuld, which has a population of just over 700 people, is in Germany's Eifel region close to the border with Belgium. At the center of the floods is the Eifel region , a low mountain range that stretches across eastern Belgium and western Germany, bordering the Rhine and Mosel rivers. In Germany, the Eifel lies in both federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. The area is home to usually gentle, picturesque rivers that run through the towns. These are the rivers that burst their banks, flooding and laying to waste entire villages. Heavy rain in such mountainous terrain is particularly dangerous because water collects in the valleys instead of spreading evenly across other surfaces. This is what happened in the Ahr region, a particularly narrow valley, where a sudden rise in water levels would leave residents with little chance to escape the flood. The small towns affected in the Eifel area benefit mainly from tourist economic activity, which had slowed down significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The floods are likely to be a terrible setback for the region. Before and after footage of the Ahr valley show just how much water was carried by the small river, spilling into the entire town and the dramatic devastation that followed.

Germany's oldest Grand Prix race track has been turned into a provisional center to help the victims of the recent floods.\u00a0 Thousands of motor sports fans had marked July 15 to 17 in their diaries for the ADAC Truck Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ferry, a Dutchman who has worked at the event as an attendant in recent years, decided to stay on to help when the floods struck.\u00a0 Oliver Pieper reports from the scene . Opposition parties have hit out at Armin Laschet, the state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia , who hopes to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor in September's election. The Christian Democratic (CDU) candidate was filmed making a joke with aides during his visit to flood-hit areas of western Germany, sparking fierce criticism. \"The way Armin Laschet is joking around in the background while President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is speaking to victims is without decency and outrageous,\" Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the Social Democrats (SPD), told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. \"They say that in times of crisis, one's true character reveals itself,\" he said, concluding that Laschet had \"disqualified himself.\" The Social Democrats are currently in coalition with the conservative CDU, but running against them in the September 26 poll. The economic liberal Free Democrat (FDP) party also attacked Laschet in the same paper, with deputy parliamentary leader Michael Theurer saying that \"fooling around without a mask while the president remembers the victims does not do justice to the seriousness of the situation.\" Laschet apologized on Saturday evening, calling his conduct\u00a0\"inappropriate.\" Germany's Association of Cities and Municipalities (DGsTB), a group that represents the interests of local authorities, has said there needs to be fundamental reform when it comes to protection from\u00a0potential natural disasters. \"The disaster shows once again that we need to reorganize civil protection in a new, better and more sustainable way,\" said DStGB chief executive Gerd Landsberg in an interview with the Funke Mediengruppe. The Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance must be strengthened and early warning systems improved, he said. The number of people who have died in the extreme flooding in Germany has risen to 156, authorities say. Koblenz police said on Sunday that another 12 bodies had been found in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate overnight, bringing the number of fatalities there to 110. Officials in the neighboring state of North Rhine-Westphalia reported 45 deaths by late Saturday evening. At least one person is now known to have died in floods in the Bavarian district of Berchtesgadener Land, close to the border with Austria and the city of Salzburg. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz praised the country's emergency services after it, too, was hit by extreme weather. \"Heavy rains and storms are unfortunately causing severe damage in many places in Austria,\" Kurz wrote on Twitter. \"I would like to thank all the emergency services and volunteers who are doing everything to help! We will not leave those affected alone and support them in rebuilding,\" he said. A flash flood swept through the town of Hallein, near the German border, late Saturday. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, along with Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, has\u00a0promised help to victims of the flooding, according to the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. Scholz told the newspaper he will propose several assistance measures to other cabinet members next week. He said an amount \"significantly higher\" than \u20ac300 million ($354 million) in emergency aid would be needed for the victims of the flooding. The floods are hitting not only western Germany, but also other parts of the country.\u00a0 Hard rainfall in the eastern German state of Saxony has caused flooding in a region called Saxon Switzerland, which is located southeast of the major city of Dresden. The hilly area around the Elbe valley is a popular tourist destination. The Berchtesgadener Land district of Germany's Upper Bavaria on Saturday night declared a disaster situation due to flooding.\u00a0 Two deaths were reported although it was initially unclear whether these\u00a0were related to the floods, a\u00a0spokesperson said. \n At DW, we are constantly striving to improve our service to you.

{"id": null, "body": "     A warm winter and autumn have made the previous year the hottest ever recorded, the EU's climate change service has found. The Arctic continues to warm more quickly than the planet as a whole. The last decade was the hottest on record globally Last year was the hottest year on record , tying with 2016, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service said on Friday. Average global temperatures in 2020 stood at 1.25 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) higher than pre-industrial levels, according to the service. The years from 2014 to 2020 were the hottest on record with both 2020 and 2016 hitting the record for the single hottest year. Scientists urged governments and corporations to drastically slash their emissions in order to have any chance of achieving the 2015 Paris Agreement and to avoid a catastrophic climate change crisis. \"The extraordinary climate events of 2020 and the data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service show us that we have no time to lose,\" said Matthias Petschke, Director for Space in the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. Europe had an even hotter year with an increase of 0.4 degrees\u00a0over the record from 2019, while Germany saw its second-hottest year on record, according to the German Metereological Service. 2020 saw an increase of 0.6 degrees over the average temperatures between 1981 and 2010. The biggest jump was seen in the Arctic Ocean and the north of Siberia , where temperatures soared to an unprecedented six degrees above the former average. The report also revealed that carbon dioxide emissions continued to rise, reaching a new high of 431 parts per million by the end of the year. The figures are\u00a0particularly alarming because, unlike in 2016,\u00a0they were reached without the help of the El Nino weather event which added up to two tenths of a degree to the record four years ago, according to NASA and the UK's Met Office. The increase in temperature has brought with it other extreme climate events such as droughts, heatwaves and floods. In 2020 the world was also hit by a record number of hurricanes in the Atlantic, to the extent that the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ran out of letters to name them. In 2015, the world agreed to keep global temperature increases \"well below\" two degrees and below 1.5 if possible. A report by the UN's climate advisory panel, the IPCC, left no doubt that an increase of 1.5 would be disastrous. The\u00a02020 record came despite global lockdowns which led to a dramatic 7% drop in emissions. \"Since CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere like water in a bathtub, if we turn down the tap by 7%, the CO2 level just rises a bit more slowly,\" Stefan Rahmstorf, head of Earth system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told AFP. \"We need to shut off the tap to get a stable climate again.\" However, emissions followed an upward trend during 2019 and the desire of governments around the world to return to \"business as usual\" does not bode well. Even if every country were to stick to their pledges from the Paris Agreement, global temperatures would still reach an increase of 3 degrees C by the end of the century. \"The world has been warming at a steady rate of around 0.2C per decade since the 1970s due to human emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases,\"\u00a0Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute in Oakland, California, told AFP.\u00a0 \"If we continue at our current rate we will pass 1.5C in the mid-2030s.\" \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate change: 2020 ties 2016 as hottest year on record", "article_name": "climate-change-2020-ties-2016-as-hottest-year-on-record", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-2020-ties-2016-as-hottest-year-on-record/a-56166308", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 3581, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:00:54.628014"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Proof of humans' impact on warming the earth's atmosphere is unequivocal, and the world faces a moral obligation to fight climate change, according to the final report by the United Nations' leading climate council. The IPCC report said global warming is manmade and already taking place The worst-case scenario envisaged by the report was as terrifying as created in doomsday films, said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \"These scenes are as frightening as a science fiction movie,\" he said. \"But they are even more terrifying, because they are real.\" The 23-page document by the UN-backed panel of scientists, issued Saturday, Nov. 17, contained the strongest warnings yet on climate change and \"answered many of our questions on climate change,\" the secretary general said. New ethic required IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri pointed out several findings, including the threat rising sea levels posed to small island nations and hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying deltas as well as more infectious diseases and the destruction of coral reefs. Ban Ki-moon Had recently been on a trip to see ice shelves breaking up in Antarctica \"We need a new ethic by which every human being realizes the importance of the challenge we are facing and starts to take action through changes in lifestyle and attitude,\" he said. \"Every country in the world has to be committed to a shared vision and a set of common goals and actions that will help us move toward a much lower level of emissions.\" Ban added that the international community would now have to \"transform\" its way of doing things in order to save the \"treasure of our planet.\" The final report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is essentially a summary of three reports compiled by more than 2,000 scientists and issued by the IPCC earlier this year. EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said the report was \"a milestone in our scientific knowledge about climate change and the grave threats global warming poses to the planet.\" \"The report's findings amount to a stark warning that the world must act fast to slash greenhouse gas emissions if we are to prevent climate change from reaching devastating levels,\" he said in a statement. \"The good news is that it also shows that deep emission cuts are both technologically feasible and economically affordable.\" Basis for Bali conference Climate change won't spare any regions of the world, the IPCC report said Governments haggled for five days over the wording of this final IPCC document, which environmentalists say will serve as a manual on how to tackle global warming and set the tone for a crucial UN climate conference in Bali, Indonesia next month. \"We cannot afford to leave Bali without such a breakthrough,\" Ban said, referring to a conference running on the Indonesian island from Dec. 3-14, tasked with setting a strategy for deepening cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions. Government representatives at the Bali conference are expected to negotiate a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to make targeted commitments on curbing their greenhouse gases and expires in 2012. The new IPCC report makes clear that global warming is a man-made phenomenon and is already taking place. It warns of catastrophic and unavoidable consequences if the atmosphere warms by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F). Global temperatures have already risen about 0.7 degrees Celsius over the last 100 years. Global warming can only be slowed The UN council said greenhouse gas emissions needed to drop by at least 50 percent by 2050 To prevent that, the level of carbon dioxide in the world's atmosphere must start dropping by 2020. By 2050, global emissions must be 50 percent to 65 percent below 2000 levels. The IPCC has already said global warming cannot be stopped, only slowed. Melting glaciers and loss of snow in Alpine regions as well as thinning Arctic summer sea ice and thawing permafrost shows that climate change is already on the march, the IPCC report said. Some of the newer elements of the report include one combined graphic that at a glance lays out specifically what levels of greenhouse gases lead to what rises in temperatures -- and what consequences each temperature rise could have on society. Environmental groups pleased Representatives from environmental protection groups appeared pleased with the study's results. \"The strong message of the IPCC can't be watered down -- the science is crystal clear,\" said Hans Verolme, director of environmental group WWF's Global Climate Change Program. \"The hard fact is we have caused climate change, and it's also clear that we hold the solution to stop global warming in our hands,\" The IPCC was last month awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with former US Vice President Al Gore, for raising awareness of the threat of climate change. German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel said a government package of energy saving measures would dramatically benefit both the environment and the economy, with cost savings of up to five billions euros.

{"id": null, "body": "     Australia, a major coal exporter and one of the worst per capita emitters, goes to the polls Saturday. The result could be decisive for global climate goals, as voters demand lawmakers do more to cut emissions. Australians are already dealing with hellish wildfires, worsened by climate change The results of the Australian election this Saturday will set the climate agenda for one of the planet's worst per-capita CO2 emitters. It comes\u00a0as the world faces a rapidly closing window to stop the most severe impacts\u00a0of climate change. The country, dubbed a \"wrecker\" at climate change negotiations,\u00a0is a major exporter of fossil fuels, largely to East Asia and India. It\u00a0has been criticized\u00a0for grossly insufficient climate targets by the UK and US as well as its neighboring Pacific nations who could see their homes disappear as sea levels rise. Australians want action on climate change, but major parties have hardly mentioned the issue in their election campaigns At the same time, polls clearly show voters back stronger climate action in the \"sunburned land,\" having already experienced deadly and costly flooding and wildfires linked to climate change in recent years. Some big businesses, once against emissions cuts,\u00a0have also done a U-turn on climate policy. The country is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. \"Australians are feeling and seeing climate damage now and that's why most Australians are very worried about climate change and want the government to do a lot more than they are,\" said Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF). Despite public support, the major parties vying for votes in the tight election have barely mentioned the issue in their campaigns, said Peter Christoff, senior research fellow with Melbourne Climate Futures, which is part of the University of Melbourne. \"And that's really quite concerning and worrying,\" said Christoff. Wildfires in 2021: Australians are already feeling the effects of the climate crisis Since 2007, Australia's two major parties, the center-left Labor Party and the conservative Liberal Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison, have been in an open war over climate change policies, leading to multiple leaders being toppled. \"The public vitriol in political exchanges \u2014 particularly over an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon and carbon taxes \u2014 led to some of the ugliest politics we've seen in Australia over a 15-year period,\" said Christoff. Labor believes it lost the supposedly unlosable \"climate election\" in 2019 to the Liberals because of a backlash against its strong climate policies and job fears in key seats in coal-mining areas. Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter. And because of\u00a0the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising coal prices mean Australia will likely earn 100 billion Australian dollars (\u20ac67\u00a0billion, $70\u00a0billion) in one year from coal. Meanwhile, between 100,000 and 300,000 Australian jobs connected to coal, oil and gas are at risk if the country doesn't prepare for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to a study by independent Australian think tank, the Centre for Policy Development. To date, the conservatives\u00a0have stymied significant action on climate change \u2014 blocking a major emissions trading scheme,\u00a0 slashing funding on climate research, \u00a0subsidizing and allowing fossil fuel production to expand and abolishing the government-funded Climate Commission. At the 2021\u00a0UN climate conference in Glasgow, the government refused to budge from its 2030 emission cuts of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels \u2014\u00a0one of the weakest targets in the developed world. The UN Climate Action Tracker rates Australia's emissions and net-zero targets as \"poor\" and \"highly insufficient,\" putting it on a path to\u00a0more than 3 degrees Celsius warming. Going into the 2022 election, the Liberal Party\u00a0 pledged to go net-zero by 2050 , but has given itself scope to ignore this . At the same time, it has vowed to continue exports of Australia's coal and gas past 2050 and has included these fossil fuels in its domestic energy blueprint. Labor \u2014 currently forecast to win this election \u2014 has also vowed to go net-zero by 2050 and has stronger emission cuts of 43% by 2030 . It has\u00a0pledged tens of billions of dollars to revitalize the nation's energy grid and install solar banks and batteries. But it\u00a0says it won't stop exporting coal and gas. The Australian Green Party, as well as climate-minded independents, are seeing a surge in support Australia is dominated by two main parties, but by dragging their heels on climate change Labor and the Liberals have opened the door to new challengers. A group of independents, dubbed \"the teals,\" are competing with Liberal lawmakers\u00a0for urban seats. Mostly women, they\u00a0receive funding from a group called Climate 200 \u2014 a relatively new political fund\u00a0established by clean energy investor Simon Holmes a Court \u2014 and have campaigned on climate, integrity, and gender equality. They have all set ambitious 2030 emission reduction targets ranging from 50% to 70% by 2030. And they appear to be attracting moderate Liberal voters who have become disillusioned with a lack of movement on climate change. Most recent polling shows several key seats are at risk. Meanwhile, the Greens\u00a0have enjoyed a surge and are now polling at about 15% nationally \u2014 compared to 10% in the 2019 election. They have pledged to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 , go net-zero by 2035, phase out the mining, burning and exporting of coal by 2030 and convert the grid to 100% renewables. Depending on the result of the election, both the Greens and the teal candidates could wield significant power over the government. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg may lose his seat to a climate-friendly independent Businesses are also calling for more action. In one\u00a0example, Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes is attempting to use his wealth to force energy giant AGL to exit coal-fired power generation. Even the Business Council of Australia \u2014\u00a0which represents big\u00a0banks and corporations, such as industrial and retail giant Wesfarmers, mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto and airline Qantas\u00a0\u2014 is now also calling for major emission cuts by 2030. It's a dramatic shift for the organization that in 2018 called 45% emissions reduction cuts \"an economy wrecking target.\" \"It's certainly not the community that is holding back the Australian political parties on climate action and also not the business community,\" ACF's O'Shanassy said. \"Everyone wants climate action except for the people that go to Parliament House.\" But neither Labor nor the Liberals' targets are enough to bring Australia in line with its Paris Commitments. Emissions cuts of at least 50% by 2030 are what's required to keep it below the upper threshold of 2 degrees warming and about 75% for the 1.5-degree target, according to some estimates. ACF believes\u00a0 the next government should\u00a0take advantage of the country's\u00a0huge solar and wind potential and could quickly cut\u00a0emissions while preserving jobs by replacing fossil fuel\u00a0exports with products created with renewable energy such as hydrogen and ammonia. \"We need to use the vast amount of renewable energy we have in this country. We need to times it by about ten and then turn that into exports and stop exporting pollution to the world,\" O'Shanassy said. \"That would be our greatest contribution to climate change.\" Many countries around the world banned the usual New Year's fireworks to relieve pressure on hospitals swamped with COVID-19 cases. For Germany, that meant an estimated 3,500 tons of plastic waste saved. In Amsterdam, the taboo on home pyrotechnics looks set to endure, with the city organizing public displays instead. Europe and North America saw plunging temperatures, with many regions blanketed in deep snow. Arctic warming caused dips in the polar vortex and a weaker jet stream, conspiring to send chilly Arctic air south. Disruption of the jet stream can also have the reverse effect, sending warm air up from the tropics. We're yet to see which trend will dominate as the planet continues to heat up. Thousands of people had to leave their homes after heavy rain flooded towns in eastern Australia. Gladys Berejiklian, then the premier of New South Wales, a state that was particularly affected, called the inundation a \"one-in-100-year event.\" Some commentators argued that this kind of flooding is in fact becoming the new normal. Europe's biggest economy was given a reality check by its Constitutional Court, which declared the German Climate Protection Act unconstitutional for failing to include climate targets beyond 2030. The court said this would place too great a burden on future generations. The Bundestag toughened up the legislation with a commitment to go climate-neutral by 2045. In another landmark ruling, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered Shell to cut its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was the first time a private company has been legally forced to comply with the global agreement. \"This applies to the entire world, so also to Shell,\" the judge said. More than 230 people died during a heat wave in Canada, with record temperatures of nearly 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) recorded in Lytton, British Columbia. The following day, forest fires reduced much of the village to ash. This was also a summer of devastating blazes for California, Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey, and Siberia and the Amazon. In Central Europe, catastrophic heavy rain turned streams into raging rivers that inundated towns and villages as they burst their banks. In Germany's Rhineland, more than 180 people lost their lives. Parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also suffered extreme floods. Property damage in Germany alone was estimated at several billion euros. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report with an unequivocal message: The climate crisis is worse than we thought and humans are definitely to blame. The IPCC's assessment reports are the most detailed and comprehensive on the topic, in this case drawing on more than 14,000 peer-reviewed studies. At the UN General Assembly, Premier Xi Jinping announced that China would no longer build coal-fired power plants abroad \u2014 putting an end to a construction spree that has already seen hundreds of Chinese-backed coal power projects go up as part of its Belt and Road Initiative through Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. But Beijing continues to build new coal power plants at home. Concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere reached a new record in 2020. According to the report by the World Meteorological Organization, the year-on-year increase was higher than the average increase over the past decade, despite the economic fallout of the pandemic. The WMO announced the figures with the warning that \"we are way off track\" for the Paris Agreement targets. After a pandemic hiatus, the UN Climate Change Conference was back in 2021, but it struggled to decide the details of the Glasgow Climate Pact. With India and China resisting a commitment to phase out coal, the final text agreed only to a \"phasedown.\" For many, this was hugely disappointing, though not necessarily surprising. Greta Thunberg had already declared COP26 \"a global greenwash festival.\" With the year drawing to a close, the US was hit by more extreme weather as 36 tornadoes swept through six states and left devastation in their wake. Homes and businesses were demolished, while dozens of people were killed. President Biden announced an investigation into global heating's impact on the tornadoes. Soonafter, nearly 400 people died in the Philippines after Typhoon Rai hit. Author: Jeannette Cwienk Edited by: Jennifer Collins The average global temperature could exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2026, UN meteorologists say. The threshold is one that international agreements are trying to prevent. \n\u00a0 Australia is set to declare a state of national emergency after floods on the country's east coast claimed 22 lives.

{"id": null, "body": "     Pinning down blame for complex weather events isn't straightforward. But cutting-edge science is rapidly shrinking the space to argue that the crazy weather we're experiencing isn't due to greenhouse gas emissions. Around the world, ever more of us seem to be experiencing freak storms, floods and droughts \u2014 from catastrophes that devastate whole regions, to local heat waves and floods that leave us thinking: Surely it didn't used to be like this? Since the early 1990s, scientists have been able to clearly show a rise in the average global temperature due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. With the Earth getting hotter, heat waves become more intense and more frequent. High temperatures evaporate more water, so average global rainfall increases too. With more energy and water vapor in the system, circulation patterns change how weather systems develop, causing severe storms in some regions and drought in others. Pinning the blame for any given weather event \u2014 of even global weather trends \u2014 has long been controversial. Yet scientists are getting closer to establishing the link. Read more: \u00a0 Arctic warmer than much of Europe is a worrying sign of climate change A global trend? In March, the European Academies' Science Advisory Council published a report urging the European Union to up its climate adaptation efforts . Scientists used data from insurance company Munich Re to show that storms and events such as floods and droughts \u2014 and the costs resulting from them \u2014 have been on the rise since 1980. The report's author, Michael Norton, admits the data is not perfect. He points out that more events get reported now, so older figures may be low. Also, the assets at risk will have changed \u2014 for example through increased building on floodplains. But the trend of extreme events happening more frequently as greenhouse gas emissions accumulate in our atmosphere \"is pretty obvious.\" This becomes clear from comparing their frequency with other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, which remains stable. \"The data from the insurance industry shows that there is significant increase in the number of claims of climate-related events \u2014 whereas there is no change in the number of claims to those which are related to geophysical things, which are not related to climate,\" Norton told DW. Read more: \u00a0 Last three years hottest to date, costing billions and destroying livelihoods Still, plotting global trends depends on data that may have been gathered differently in different parts of the world, and not necessarily with climate change in mind. And it gets shakier the further back you go. \"Many early disasters would not have been recorded, and details have been lost,\" Gavin Schmidt a NASA Goddard climate modeler told DW. More complexity \u2014 more uncertainty And because weather systems are extremely complex, it's not easy to prove a correlation. \"We can lump together all of the heat-wave data from around the world, and we can say with confidence that\u00a0the number of heat waves and their intensity is increasing over time,\" Schmidt said. Heat waves are increasing in certain regions of the world, including parts of Europe Rainfall intensity, too, is increasing at the planetary scale. But the more complex the weather event in question, and the greater number of variables involved, the harder it is to isolate the role of climate change. Many conditions are involved in the development of mega-storms, from water temperature to air pressure. This makes it complicated to pin down a connection. Read more: \u00a0 Is climate change making mega-hurricanes the new normal? Also how people interact with their environment plays a major role in some emanations of extreme weather. Higher global temperatures can play a role in droughts, but land-use change tends to be a far bigger factor. And the frequency and intensity of floods tends to be subject to how river systems and flood defenses are managed . \"You can detect a trend from looking at the observations,\" Friederike Otto of the Oxford University's Oxford Environmental Change Institute told DW, \"but you don't know what's causing the trend without doing the attribution.\" Advanced computing to attribute individual events When Hurricane Harvey battered Texas, members of the Trump administration accused the left of \"exploiting\" the storm to \"advance their political agenda.\" Hurricane Harvey caused $125 billion in damage (second only to Hurricane Katrina in the US, which cost $161 billion) But within weeks, a report came drawing from complex, state-of-the-art climate models to show that climate change made Harvey three times as likely to happen .\u00a0 It was authored by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) project, which calculates the increased likelihood for individual extreme weather events having happened, compared to a human-caused-emissions-free world. \"Looking at the rainfall associated with Hurricane Harvey is something that would not have been possible a few years ago,\" Otto, one of the report's authors, told DW. That's partly because scientists have only recently had at their fingertips the computational power for such complex modeling. Variables such as solar radiation and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere \u2014 as well as greenhouse gases \u2014 create the climatic conditions under which many thousands of weather events are possible. It's then down to chance exactly what weather we get (ever heard of the butterfly effect?). The butterfly effect is called so because it's imagined that a butterfly flapping its wings can cause a typhoon Putting a figure on the risk of a single event happening compared to the thousands of other possible outcomes is only now possible because scientists can run models innumerable times to see how frequently an event arises. Another reason it's now possible to better isolate the role played by emissions it that their effect is becoming more significant. Read more: \u00a0 2017: The year climate change hit Extreme weather: more impact, more likely \"The climate is changing, so the signal that you're looking for is also increasing,\" Schmidt said. \"We're seeing continued warming, and so the impacts of that are being felt more clearly throughout the system.\" Schmidt says there are limits to what weather attribution can tell us, with many events being impossible to attribute because the models don't have enough fine spatial detail. Heat waves remain easier to pin down than more complex weather events \u2014 and have revealed some startling results. A WWA study found that southern Europe's unusually hot summer last year was 10 times more likely as a result of climate change, and the intense August heat wave dubbed Lucifer made four times more probable. \"The larger-scale it is, the easier it is to attribute and predict; the smaller-scale, the harder,\" Schmidt said. \"And the more it's related directly to temperature the easier; the more it's related to water, the harder,\" he continued. But the science continues getting better \u2014 models are becoming more complex and more fine-grained. As this happens, attribution studies are getting churned out faster. Claudia Tebaldi, a climate statistician at the United States National Center for Atmospheric Research, says when the field of weather attribution emerged about a decade ago, it took a couple of years to produce a study. Now, simpler events can me modeled in just a few days \u2014 and that's key to informing public debate. \"There are some big events that will be talked about for a long time \u2014 like Harvey, because people are still suffering the consequences.\" \"But for smaller events, it's important to have something to say as (or right after) the event unfolds, because the news cycle moves on,\" Tebaldi told DW. Weather forecasting has improved massively. 40 years ago meteorologists could only predict weather for the next two or three days. Today weather can be predicted reliably for seven days. But forecasters also give monthly and seasonal predictions. These can be tremendously important for agriculture. If a severe storm is predicted ahead of time, farmers can prepare. Weather is forecast with the help of supercomputers that predict the weather using complex mathematical models and current weather conditions. Some centers for weather prediction take account of up to 900 million global points. For the prediction, the world is split up into grids with grid points spaced 9 km apart. In 1975 several European states decided to share their data to improve the forecast. They set up the \u201cEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast\u201d (ECMWF). Today the centre has 22 member states, 12 co-operating countries and some of the world's most modern supercomputers. Roughly a year and a half ago the centre expanded its weather models. Before, they were based on atmospheric predictions. Now the forecasts take more elements into account, such as ocean and land data. This makes them more reliable. With the weather changing due to climate change, forecasts are changing too. Scientists still cannnot link climate change and weather change exactly. Scientists are sure that climate change intensifies extreme weather events. Heatwaves are even hotter, hurricanes are more intense. That means weather forecasting today is also about saving lives and protecting property. If the forecasts are more exact and data is available faster, people can prepare better for severe weather events. Thunder and lightning are very hard to forecast and becoming more intense. It is impossible to predict exactly where lightning will strike. However, this might well improve. The ECMWF is working on predicting lightning within a 50 km range. In general, weather forecasting will continue to improve. By 2025 reliable weather forecasts might cover 10 days instead of the seven that are possible today. That could well mean three extra days to prepare for storms and extreme weather.  Author: Lisa H\u00e4nel The driest inhabited continent on earth, Australia, has lived with bushfires for millennia.

{"id": null, "body": "     In the first global strike of this pandemic year, citizens the world over will be shouting in unison for bold climate action. It's time for leaders to get real, says DW's Tamsin Walker. Passing by a shop window recently, a giant photo of a young woman wearing an uncertain half-smile caught my eye. Emblazoned beneath her in meter-high letters were the words \"the future is bright.\"\u00a0A bold statement. In more ways than one. Yet for all the bellowing of the message, the look on the model's face seemed to quietly whisper a different story. Maybe she knew she was posing for an untruth. For a future in which the most immediate brightness is cast by the orange glow of climate fires , in which temperatures soar and ice sheets continue to melt while fossil fuels are extracted and burned as if we knew no better; for a future in which drought\u00a0and flooding compete for relief and hurricanes batter shores while politicians shrug it all off with reckless abandon. Such realities, such devastating disassociation, are at the heart of today's global strike. Organized by international climate movement\u00a0\u00a0 Fridays for Future (FFF), it is another demand for ambitious goals and action, another attempt to drive home that simple truth that we really do only have one planet, and another reminder to critics who belittle FFF as a passing teenage phase, that nothing could be further from the truth. During the pandemic Fridays for Future activists have found other ways to get their message across - such as online and by collecting posters to lay out in front of the Reichstag in Berlin More than two years have passed since FFF founder Greta Thunberg embarked on her first solo strike outside the Swedish parliament. And a year has slipped by since the school strike movement that grew up around her mobilized at least 6 million people in 150 countries to demand climate action. Much has happened in that time. Highest-ever temperature records have been broken, Siberia, Australia, the US have all experienced unprecedented fires connected to global heating, glaciers \u00a0have continued to retreat, cyclones in Africa have claimed more than a thousand lives and drought has hit agriculture across much of Europe . Meanwhile, deforestation continues in the Amazon, US President Donald Trump has given the green light for oil and gas development in Alaska's Arctic refuge,\u00a0and Germany is not planning to kick its coal habit until 2038. DW Environment Editor, Tamsin Walker Throughout it all, FFF activists have been pushing world leaders to act. Less visibly perhaps, as the pandemic forced them to protest online instead of gathering en masse, but they've continued applying pressure. Over the past weeks and months alone, Thunberg has had an audience with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and with German Chancellor Angela Merkel . Prior to the pandemic, she and other FFF members had won a reputation for being unafraid to offer harsh truths to heads of state and industry at high-ranking events around the world. Such meetings and appearances are freely dismissed as publicity stunts. On both sides. Yet cities, governments and even the EU have declared climate emergencies, and earlier this month, von der Leyen, who laid out a green deal for Europe at the end of 2019, said the bloc should now be aiming for a 55% cut in carbon emissions by 2030. And just this week, China \u2014 the world's biggest CO2 polluter \u2014 announced plans to hit its own emissions peak in 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060. The date stretches painfully into the distance, and the goal will not keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius, but it is being regarded as a significant step along the global climate action path. Scientists says prolonged drought in places like the US and Australia has made them extremely vulnerable to fire Germany is not planning to complete its coal phaseout for another 18 years Politicians would be unlikely to hold up their hands and attribute big policy shifts to a group \u2014 albeit a big one \u2014 of teenagers and 20-somethings, but it's hard to imagine they haven't been touched by the influence and tenacity of this movement that has spawned countless sub-groups and proved itself difficult to ignore. Friday's global strike will be different from that massive euphoric event this time last year in that it will be tailored to each location's COVID-19 restrictions, but it will be no less determined. As FFF participants say themselves, they will keep protesting as long as the exploitation of nature is allowed to continue. Until the climate crisis is overcome. That, of course, will require bold, concerted action at a policy and regulatory level. It will require politicians the world over to be as tenacious in their actions as the teenagers calling for today's strike. If our heads of government, state and industry were to follow that lead, the future would assume on a whole new brightness. And that would be something worthy of a genuine smile. This now iconic image of Greta Thunberg holding a placard reading \"School strike for the climate\" was taken outside the Swedish parliament on a Friday in November 2018. Just 15 at the time, Thunberg and her action have since led to the emergence of \"Fridays for Future,\" a global climate crisis movement that has attracted millions of young people around the world. This slogan, seen in Berlin at an anti-coal rally in 2017, links the #MeToo hashtag that represents sexual harassment and abuse of women with the abuse of Mother Earth and the planet's natural environment. It was created by activists gathered in the German capital to demand an end to power plants fueled by coal, the world's most carbon-heavy, climate change-inducing fossil fuel. Climate crisis activists blocked traffic in the London financial district during environmental protests by the Extinction Rebellion campaign in April 2019. In addition to signs reiterating the climate emergency, \"We can't eat money\" has become a popular slogan for Extinction Rebellion, which correlates unfettered capitalism and climate change. In October last year, activists marched together in the direction of the Hambach open-pit coal mine in Germany's Rhineland region, where coal mining threatens a pristine forest. Despite Berlin agreeing to phase out coal by 2038, this protest banner linked the core anti-coal message with a broader political, social and economic meaning. As schoolchildren have taken to the streets to fight the climate crisis across the world, an ever-growing range of slogans have peppered the demonstrations. At this March 15 \"Fridays for Future\" protest in Hong Kong, one student (far right) summed up how the irresponsibility of older generations has forced them to take action. Students in Cape Town, South Africa also took part in the global March 15 protest \u2014 one of some 200 around the world \u2014 as part of a worldwide student strike against government inaction on climate change. In addition to holding up placards against ongoing climate change denial, the students chanted slogans such as \"Stop denying! Our earth is dying.\" When 25,000 people turned up in Berlin to protest at a rally earlier this year, the streets were flooded with placard-waving school strikers who also carried messages on their bodies. These campaigners coupled stickers on their foreheads \u2014 one reads \"Warning Warming\" \u2014 with coordinated hand slogans reading \"Our future in your hands.\" As the \"Fridays for Future\" protests moved to Aachen near the German-Belgian border in late June, one banner highlighted the inevitable repercussions of burning carbon dioxide at a time when atmospheric carbon levels have reached their highest point in recorded human history. This popular rallying slogan for climate activists was popularized by, among others, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who stated at a 2014 climate summit in New York that \"There is no plan B because we do not have planet B.\" The slogan is also the title of a 2019 book by author Mike Berners-Lee that illustrates how humanity can sustainably \"thrive on this \u2014 our only \u2014 planet.\" The founder of the school strike protests, Greta Thunberg, joined a demo in Hamburg on March 1, just a few weeks after she told business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos: \"I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day and then I want you to act.\" This slogan at the Hamburg rally embodies the movement's calls for urgent action.

{"id": null, "body": "     Over two dozen of the world's largest cities have seen emissions decrease over a five-year period, they have revealed. But a closer look at the list shows why it may be too early to celebrate. Twenty-seven major cities, including Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York and Paris, have seen greenhouse gas emissions fall over a five-year period to levels\u00a0at least 10 percent lower than their peak, they announced Thursday at a global climate summit in San Francisco. The milestone was reached by cutting their usage of fossil-fuel-generated electricity, expanding their public transportation networks and reducing waste, according to C40 Cities, a network of large cities acting as leaders in combatting climate change. Paris\u00a0Mayor Anne Hidalgo said it was a relief to \"finally share good news on climate change.\" With economies continuing to grow even as emissions stagnate or fall, \"we can prove that we can also create jobs, create opportunities with the ecological transition,\" she said. Filling the void Thousands of politicians, climate activists and business leaders from around the world have descended on San Francisco to boost efforts to reduce global warming. They are attempting to fill the void left by US President Donald Trump's decision to\u00a0withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate deal, which commits countries to set their own plans for cutting emissions. The United States is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China. Experts have been warning that global warming is set to exceed the more ambitious limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) called for in the Paris Agreement. Developing world cities absent The 27 cities that have seen their emissions peak are home to just 54 million people. No city from the developing world made it to the list, underscoring the enormity of the challenge. \"We must strive toward funds going toward the ecological and energy transition where it is most urgent, including in developing cities,\" Hidalgo said. Experts predicted that emissions in poorer countries may continue to rise over the next few years.

{"id": null, "body": "     Bangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Extreme weather events there have already been wreaking havoc on the people there. They're also causing a shift in migration and poverty patterns. In August 2017, 6.8 million people in northwestern Bangladesh found their land and crops drowned under flood water. The totally submerged land constituted over 16,000 hectares, while another 560,000 hectares of crops were partially damaged. That's not an isolated occurrence.\u00a0\u00a0 In April the same year, floods wreaked havoc on Bangladeshi farmers, damaging around 220,000 hectares of ready-to-be harvested crops, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Read more: \u00a0 Who does Bangladesh bill for climate impacts? Official estimates suggest that in 2017 alone, the floods severely affected the livelihoods of at least eight million people living in Bangladesh. \"The second largest mass of water for a country flows down through Bangladesh,\" Atiq Rahman, a leading environmentalist and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), told DW. \"Rain contributes only eight percent of the water that flows through Bangladesh. The rest 92 percent comes from China, India, Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan,\" he added.\u00a0During the monsoon season every year, between June and September, Bangladesh faces flash floods. Manifold effects But floods are not the only problem Bangladesh faces. \"Bangladesh is vulnerable to sea-level rise, like in the case of the Maldives, but other effects like drought, cyclone, lightning and river erosion have made this country more defenseless,\" Rahman said. Germanwatch, a Bonn-based environmental NGO, estimated that 407 people died in Bangladesh last year due to extreme weather related events - floods, landslide, storms and cyclones. The country also suffered an economic loss of about $2.82 billion (\u20ac2.48 billion), the NGO said. In a new global index, Bangladesh has been ranked seventh among the countries most affected by extreme weather events in 20 years since 1998. The Long-Term Climate Risk Index listed Puerto Rico and Sri Lanka as the top two affected countries. The index is part of a report, Global Climate Risk Index 2019, which was recently released at the annual climate summit in Poland's Katowice city. The report was prepared analyzing damages caused by the extreme weather events that took place from 1998 to 2017. \"This rank is just a number. It does not tell a lot,\" Rahman argued. \"What terrifies me is that the most vulnerable countries are becoming even more vulnerable.\" Read more: \u00a0 Solar microgrids enable energy sharing in rural Bangladesh Dampening growth Bangladesh has been one of the fastest growing economies in the world over the past several years, with the nation's economy expanding by an average of 6-7 percent over the past decade. The government is attempting to boost growth further and targeting double-digit expansion in the coming years. But some economists say climate change-linked problems are likely to act as a drag on the nation's growth prospects.\u00a0 \"A study conducted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) concluded that climate change has been posing big economic and development challenges for Bangladesh,\" Selim Raihan, an economics professor, told DW. The study pointed out that Bangladesh would face annual economic costs equivalent to about 2 percent of its GDP by 2050, widening to 9.4 percent by 2100. The reasons for these losses, according to ADB, include an immense loss of crops, land, internal migration and salinity, among other things. \"To maintain or uplift economic growth, you need investment. But in Bangladesh, due to climate change, economic development requires comparatively more resources and investment. This also adds to economic loss,\" said Raihan. Raihan also pointed out that climate-related catastrophes are causing a shift in migration and poverty patterns in Bangladesh. \"Because of the huge internal migration as a result of climate-related issues, poor people from the south of the country are migrating to urban areas,\" the expert said, adding: \"So eventually poverty is being transferred from rural to urban areas.\" Bangladesh\u2019s farmers are particularly affected by climate change as more and more farmlands get flooded. Farmers in the affected regions have started creating floating gardens with organic material where vegetables can be grown. Farmers create floating rafts on floodwater using water hyacinth, bamboo, cow dung, dirt, soil and other composts. Such rafts shift their position along with the water level and remain afloat for a period long enough to grow vegetables. Farmers cultivate summer and winter vegetables such as gourd and okra as well as other leafy vegetables on their floating gardens. The method is cheap and sustainable, according to the country's agriculture experts. Not only do farmers cultivate vegetables on the floating farms, \u2018boat schools\u2019 provide primary education to children during the rains in Bangladesh, when half the country is under water. Such boat schools have been in operation for almost a decade, especially in the northern part of the country. Boat schools are equipped with computers that have an internet connection. Local non-government organizations offer solar lamps to students for home use in areas without electricity. A gypsy folk of snake charmers known as \u2018Bedey\u2019 have always lived on boats in Bangladesh. They travel from place to place following the river routes. The tradition is on the decline but might make a comeback as a method of adapting to climate change. Experts consider initiatives like floating gardens and boat schools as small solutions to a big problem. 20 million people will be displaced in Bangladesh in the coming five years, according to IPCC. Some islands are at the risk of disappearing completely under the rising seawaters. Therefore, the country needs a strategy to combat as well as to cope with climate change. Author: Arafatul Islam More resilience needed Nazrul Islam, a professor of geography and environment of the University of Dhaka, said that more resilience is needed to deal with the problem. \"In Bangladesh, we have already conducted research on salinity-resilient crops. We're now doing research on diversification of food in coastal areas,\" Islam told DW.\u00a0 But the expert said the cost of climate change adaptation measures remains prohibitively high and countries like Bangladesh cannot afford to spend such huge sums on them. According to ADB, if the world continued on its current path, South Asia would need to spend at least $73 billion on climate change adaptation measures. Raihan believes that countries like Bangladesh should pursue global partnerships to tackle climate change. \"The global south should join forces and fight together to overcome the problems posed by climate change. In this mission, forging a meaningful partnership with the world's developed and largest economies is also essential,\" said Raihan.

{"id": null, "body": "     Overconsumption, not overpopulation, drives climate change. A projected decline in fertility could see the world's population peak in just four decades, with Japan and Spain halving in size. Shortly before he shot dead 22 mostly Hispanic people in El Paso , Texas, a little over a year ago, a white supremacist wrote in his online manifesto: \"If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can be more sustainable.\" He was inspired by a terrorist in Christchurch , New Zealand, who five months earlier had killed 51 Muslim worshippers in attacks on two mosques and identified as an \"eco-fascist.\" Neither the fears nor the actions of the two men are grounded in science. Fertility is falling, people are aging , and by the end of the century humans will be shrinking in number on almost every country on Earth, according to a recent study published in the journal Lancet . Far from an overpopulation crisis, demographers are asking where the next generations of young people will come from. The study from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projects the number of people on the planet will peak just four decades from now, at 9.7 billion, before falling to 8.8 billion by the end of the century. In 80 years, countries like Spain and Japan would halve in size. China would shrink by almost as much, leaving India and Nigeria as the world's biggest countries. Only in 12 countries, including Somalia and South Sudan, would there be enough babies to keep populations stable. The rest would be aging. By 2050, 151 countries would have aging populations China's population is projected to fall by 48% in 80 years And if the world meets targets for universal education and contraception \u2014 the positive driving force behind falling fertility \u2014 there would be 1.5 billion people fewer in 2100 than there are today. That demographic shift would transform societies. Who would pay for elderly health care? Would countries fight over young migrants? When, if at all, would people get to retire? It also raises a question that has dogged the environmental movement for decades and is being increasingly weaponized by the far-right: Shouldn't fewer people be good news for the planet? Overpopulation is a convenient idea. To some, it means their consumption isn't what's damaging the planet, but rather the sheer mass of people \u2014 so there's little point in changing their behavior. The IHME study says fewer people on the planet would mean lower carbon emissions, less stress on global food systems\u00a0and less chance of \"transgressing planetary boundaries.\" But the problem, scientists say, is that people do not emit equally . \"It's this extremely superficial analysis,\" said Arvind Ravikumar, assistant professor of energy engineering at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology.\u00a0 Countries with the highest fertility rates are least responsible for climate change Scientists argue it is economic activity rather than population that primarily drives emissions Population growth has increased greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IPCC , the UN panel of climate science experts, but it is dwarfed by the rise in emissions per person, which is tied to income. People in the richest countries emit 50 times more than those in the poorest \u2014 and it is in these low-income, low-emitting countries where human numbers are growing fastest. \"Sometimes people try to use population as a way to let rich countries \u00a0off the hook,\" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at the Breakthrough Institute in California, \"whereas in reality, it's our consumption and our level of economic activity that drives emissions more than the number of people we have.\" A world with lots of people running on clean energy could have lower emissions than one with few people powered by fossil fuels. Big, fast-growing countries like China and India are building cheap solar panels and wind turbines that could bring their total emissions down even as incomes and populations rise. But developers across Africa and other parts of Asia are struggling to secure loans for green infrastructure . Rich countries have so far failed to deliver on a $100 billion-a-year promise they made under the Paris Agreement to help poorer countries fight climate change.\u00a0 \"We cannot tell [these] countries that, okay, we already have a lot of greenhouse gases, you should stop using energy,\" said Leiwen Jiang, a senior associate at the Population Council in New York and former IPCC lead author. \"But we can help them improve their technology.\" While lower-than-expected fertility rates may do little to cut emissions in poor countries, they could help them cope with climate change in a different way. If women had only as many children as they wanted, they would be able to take on more paid work, said Jiang. That economic boost could help cash-strapped communities respond to the increasingly severe heat waves, floods and storms that climate change has brought. Educating girls is a key driver of falling fertility rates Lower fertility rates could spur growth and help countries adapt to climate change The concept of overpopulation has a dark past. Even if you accept the premise that more people mean more emissions, \"what's your solution?\" said Ravikumar. \"Is your solution to reduce population, forcefully, and if so, whose population should be reduced?\" Like the terrorists in El Paso and Christchurch, governments throughout history have trampled over the rights of marginalized groups to control their populations. Countries like the United States and Canada forcibly sterilized Indigenous women in the second half of the 20th century, while Australia did the same for people with disabilities.\u00a0India sterilized 6.2 million mostly poor men in 1976, encouraged by foreign donors who made aid packages contingent on population control. More than 2,000 men are thought to have died in botched operations. From the late 1970s,\u00a0 China restricted population growth through fines, sterilization and forced abortions under a draconian one-child policy that lasted decades. It continues such practices against ethnic Uighur women today, according to an investigation published last month by The Associated Press. Women are having fewer children globally because more girls go to school and more people have access to contraception. Both are human rights goals even before considering the environment. But demographers disagree on how far \u2014 and how fast \u2014 fertility will continue to fall. While the IHME projects the world's population will start shrinking by 2064, the United Nations expects it to continue growing throughout the century. The difference in population between the two models is about 2 billion people by 2100 \u2014 and the uncertainties are so great that both research groups accept the possibility of the opposite trend. One reason for the discrepancy is that the UN, unlike the IHME, projects that fertility rates will rebound as countries grow richer. Surveys show that women across Europe and North America have fewer children than they would like because of barriers like expensive child care, job pressures\u00a0and men not taking on a fair share of housework. By reducing the size of some of these obstacles, countries like Germany \u00a0\u00a0have seen their fertility rate rise.\u00a0 \"The UN projections embody an optimism that the long arc of human progress will continue,\" said Sara Hertog, a demographer at the UN, adding that changing fertility rates are, in themselves, neither good news nor bad news. \"I hope the level of fertility reflects the number of children people want to have.\" A previous version of this article stated obstacles for women had been removed rather than reduced in size. This has now been corrected. The department apologizes for the error.\u00a0 France hit record temperatures this summer, and the urban heat island effect means cities are particularly hot. While vegetation releases water into the atmosphere, cooling things down, concrete and asphalt trap heat. During a heat wave, Paris can be 10 degrees hotter than the surrounding countryside. Pollution also builds up in slow-moving summer air \u2014 another reason urban heat waves can kill. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina tore apart one of America's most iconic cultural heartlands. Even though it's rebuilt, New Orleans has been battered again and again by powerful storms. A government report last year said the US southeast was \"exceptionally vulnerable to sea-level rise, extreme heat events, hurricanes and decreased water availability.\" Trump's response? \"I don\u2019t believe it.\" This year India's monsoon was the second driest in 65 years, leaving 44% of the country suffering from drought. In Chennai, things have become desperate: its main reservoir has dried up, residents are queuing for hours at pumps, water is being trucked in and hospitals are under pressure. As the planet heats up, more and more cities could run out of water. Arctic temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. This is taking its toll on cities in Russia's far north, as the permafrost beneath building foundations begins to melt. Cities like Norilsk and Yakutsk are already seeing serious subsidence, and scientists expect their infrastructure to become at least 25% less stable by mid-century. Rising seas threaten coastal cities the world over, but Jakarta, with 13 rivers, suffers more floods than most. Limited access to water means residents pump it from underground aquifers, causing subsidence. By 2050, 95% of North Jakarta could be submerged. Indonesia is building the world's biggest seawall to protect its capital, but that could leave thousands of fishermen without homes or income. Some 28% of the population of Bangladesh lives on the coast, and high tides are rising 10 times faster than the global average. In 2018, natural disasters displaced 78,000 people, with riverbank erosion \u2014 expected to increase as Himalayan ice melts \u2014 moving many more.

{"id": null, "body": "     The climate impact of economic growth is putting the ability to live at risk. But growth is also necessary to improve living standards, especially in poorer nations. Experts say there is a way out of the downward spiral. In his 2012 science fiction novel, \"News From Gardenia,\" author Robert Llewellyn peers into a world that turns out OK. Humans live harmoniously with the natural environment around them. Heavy-handed capitalism appears to have collapsed, replaced by a local exchange of goods and services. Communities seem healthier and happier, but it's a nonspecific global catastrophe in the story's history that forced the change. The narrative arc is one Greta Thunberg might subscribe to. Economic growth is a \"fairy tale\" killing the planet , she said in September. Slow down by choice now, she told leaders at the UN Climate Action Summit, or climate change will force us to \u2014 maybe sooner rather than later. Underscoring her point, Thunberg's Fridays For Future movement is calling for a Buy Nothing Day on November 29, Black Friday, a post-Thanksgiving commercial tradition in the US that kicks off the Christmas shopping season. To grow or not to grow For the majority of economists, however, a low- or no-growth solution to climate change is not a serious one, and certainly not one applicable on a global scale. \"The Greta camp is very much an advanced economy phenomenon,\" Adam Tooze, a history of economics professor at Columbia University, told DW. \"It's within the realm of reasonable politics for advanced economies to say we need no further growth .\" Not so for poorer and developing economies, which face a \"genuine hard choice\" between meeting \"existential human needs\" \u2014 such as clean water, sanitation and medical care \u2014 and pursuing the rapid decarbonization necessary to meet Paris Agreement targets on global warming. That puts most of the decarbonization burden on rich countries, Tooze said, where the challenge is a less formidable, but by no means easy matter of technology and politics. Instead of a radical shift to no growth, economists like Tooze advocate pulling existing levers of global capitalism to achieve growth without the carbon footprint. One such lever is central banks, which Tooze argues could design monetary policy that favors climate solutions like renewables, battery technology and carbon capture on a large scale, while making dirty investments less attractive. With quantitative easing (QE) back in the central bank toolbox for spurring sluggish economies, Tooze wants the European Central Bank to \"commit to buying as many green bonds as it can without crowding out private investors,\" he said. \"There is really no case for central banks or managers of foreign exchange reserves to still be underwriting a fossil fuels status quo, which we know is not sustainable.\" The idea ruffles the feathers of some central bankers, especially Germany's Bundesbank, which is opposed to QE more broadly and \"very critical\" of so-called green QE. \"Our mandate is price stability, and market neutrality is fundamental to implementing our monetary policy,\" Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said last month at a central bank meeting in Frankfurt. Green capital In other words, it's the job of politicians, not central banks, to put their thumb on the scale, tilting trillions of dollars of capital toward slowing global warming . Other financial institutions are less skittish. Earlier this month, the European Investment Bank announced it would cease supporting fossil fuel projects by the end of 2021. That would direct about \u20ac2 billion ($2.2 billion) of annual EU financing away from hydrocarbons. Climate finance analysts welcomed the EIB decision, while noting how much more needs to be done. Total global climate finance reached $612 billion in 2017, a record, before falling to $546 billion in 2018, according to an annual report released this month by Climate Policy Initiative, which advises green investment. The research group estimates as much as $3.8 trillion is needed every year to achieve Paris climate goals. \"It's just not enough,\" Barbara Buchner, CPI's climate finance director, told DW. \"But setting aside just a couple percentage points of total investment for climate action would get us much further.\" Buchner wants to see \"total economic transformation,\" which first and foremost means ending coal, electrifying transport, and producing and distributing enough renewable energy to ensure that electricity is carbon-free. The technology exists, she said, or could soon, given sufficient incentive to invest in large-scale research and development . The case for growth That kind of transformation has happened before, Ashoka Mody told DW. The Princeton University economist rests his hope for climate-neutral economic growth partly, and perhaps ironically, on the historical turning point that kicked off climate change to begin with: the Industrial Revolution. Then, as now, the global economic system fundamentally changed; and then, as now, the transition produced winners who profited, and losers who needed compensation. Mody's comparison, however, comes with a caveat: Without an existential threat looming, the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century developed as technology and business practices evolved. Adoption was more organic. The rapid rise in global temperature, as foreseen in the 2018 IPCC report, means \"we cannot afford to wait,\" he said, adding \" government intervention needs to be a lot more aggressive .\" While there is broad agreement that both a serious tax on carbon and strong regulation are necessary, Mody is mostly a proponent of the latter. \"Regulations work. Restrictions lead to innovation,\" he said, citing the Clean Water Act from 1972 as one example, which forced US industry to find ways to limit water pollution and stay profitable. For Mody, the question is not if the economy can grow, but how, because \"so many people are still desperately poor.\" At its most basic level, economic growth is what allows children to do better than their parents, he said. Without growth, people will \"lose the incentive to participate in civic life.\" \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "'Total economic transformation' \u2014 getting from here to there on climate change", "article_name": "total-economic-transformation-getting-from-here-to-there-on-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/total-economic-transformation-getting-from-here-to-there-on-climate-change/a-51433268", "date_published": "2019-11-28 00:00:00", "article_length": 6243, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:00:59.499613"}

Sensible debate is becoming increasingly difficult in these fearful times, and Zoran Arbutina says people with rational arguments are at a disadvantage. \"I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. \u2026 I want you to act as if our house is on fire.\" The words spoken by teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January are certain to end up high on the list of the year's most important quotes. It's rare to see someone express the zeitgeist so clearly. It's as if millions of mainly young people were just waiting for someone to give them the go-ahead to finally do what they needed to do: stand up, take to the streets and speak out against man-made climate change.

These days, panic rules the country \u2014 and it's putting pressure on politicians. Just do 'something' More and more German cities have declared a \"climate emergency,\" with even the European Parliament recently getting carried away and following suit . Such declarations are essentially symbolic; the climate isn't any better off as a result, but that's not the point. It's all about creating a social climate of fear, of panic. Read more: \u00a0 Opinion: Extinction Rebellion \u2014 nothing matters to this doomsday cult The latest alarming contribution is a new report by environmental think tank Germanwatch, which ranked Germany as the third-most weather-affected country in the world in 2018 , after Japan and the Philippines. Germanwatch said its Global Climate Risk Index, published annually, doesn't allow for conclusions to be drawn about how climate change has influenced extreme weather events, and said its analysis included \"statistical uncertainties.\" But that's not important \u2014what matters is the warning that rising temperatures will make extreme weather occurrences more likely. It wasn't much, but the report was enough to spread fear even further. Fear, however, usually isn't the best guide. When people panic, they rarely make good decisions \u2014 and that's certainly the case for a society. In a democracy, political decisions should be based on rational arguments and reason. In a climate of fear, rational arguments only come out when they help to further the agenda. The summer of 2019 saw heat records in Europe broken across the continent. In July, Germany recorded its highest temperature ever at 42.6 C (108 F). France broke its heat record twice in 2019, the highest temperature measuring 46.C (114.8 F) in July. Climate change increases the frequency of heat waves. In November 2019, the Italian archipelago city of Venice experienced multiple flooding events and the high water mark of 1.5 meters was reached three times in one week for the first time in recorded history. Projected sea level rise due to climate change could make these events more likely in the future. The same heat wave that brought record temperatures to France sparked the worst wildfires to hit Spain in 20 years. On the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, wildfires in August decimated a national park on the popular tourist island. Hotter temperatures and drier air due to climate change increase the risk of fires. A combination of drought, storms and extreme heat is depleting Germany's forests. According to BDF, a forest advocacy group, in Germany, more than 1 million established trees have died since 2018. \"These are no longer single unusual weather events. That is climate change,\" said a BDF representative. A glacier on the Italian side of Mont Blanc experienced accelerated melting in 2019. And enthusiasts held a \"funeral\" for the Pizol glacier in the Swiss Alps, which has almost completely disappeared. Scientists say climate change accelerates glacial melting in the Alps. Two consecutive years of drought in Germany have hit farmers hard. In 2018, record drought caused major crop failures, and heat waves in 2019 also damaged crops. \"Climate change means more frequent droughts and extreme weather events in Germany,\"said German Weather Service Vice President Paul Becker. Signs of climate change? An example: those who question global warming during extreme cold spells (yes, they still happen!) are often informed that there is a difference between climate and weather. If, on the other hand, we go through two dry, hot summers in a row, it's almost always seen as a sign of runaway climate change. Activists like to point to allegedly unambiguous scientific findings to make their claims that climate change is upon us. But when a renowned climate researcher like Hans von Storch says that protesters only \"mix up\" and \"exaggerate\" everything, his scientific integrity is immediately called into question. Read more:\u00a0 COP25: Developing past fossil fuels in India Exaggerated expectations While climate activists have pressured Germany's traditional political parties, the Greens have sailed on the waves of the environmental movement and made huge gains in recent elections. But a new conflict awaits on the horizon: should the environmentalists return to power on the federal level, the Greens and their voters will find that they cannot fulfill the raised expectations of their followers. That failure will trigger fresh disappointment, anger and even more fear. Of course, one can and should argue about climate policy. And naturally, the climate activists have made some good points. But climate policy must be decided as everything else in politics: through societal debate, and the belief in the power of the better argument. Climate change is too important an issue to be left to climate activists alone. Their worries should be taken seriously, as should the worries of many other social groups. But being dominated by the fears of a single group is never a good approach. Every day, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

India, Pakistan and Bangladesh would be the worst affected regions. If climate change continues at its current pace, deadly heatwaves could make large parts of South Asia too hot for human survival by the end of the century, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) warned on Wednesday. \"The most intense hazard from extreme future heat waves is concentrated around the densely populated agricultural regions of the Ganges and Indus river basins,\" wrote the authors of the study.

Some 10,500 firefighters were called to tackle forest fires in California in 2015. They were unable to prevent 1,400 homes from destruction. The blaze was fueled by hot and dry weather - as a result of climate change. The polar bear has become a symbol of climate change, as its habitat is threatened by global warming. The Arctic predator hunts from ice sheets that are fast disappearing. As the ice retreats, they are unable to stalk their prey, and risk starvation. By 2050, scientists warn that the Arctic could be ice-free in summer. Just visible from the air is a little wood hut on the island of Spitzbergen in Norway. It is home to the Arctic research base where French and German scientists are studying climatic and atmospheric changes in the polar region, including the damage done to permafrost and glacier systems. A goat watches a mountain expedition on the Swiss Aletsch Glacier, a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was around a kilometer longer in 1860 than it is today. Due to global warming, the glacier is shrinking by up to 50 meters per year. With the rate of retreat increasing, scientists fear Europe's biggest glacier could disappear altogether. \u2026 the landscape looks peaceful, bathed in a mystical light. But the actual situation is far more unsettling. This aerial view shows Central Luzon in the Philippines, completely flooded after it was hit by a typhoon and heavy rain. People were drowned or buried under landslides, and half a million were forced to flee their homes. The country is hit by 20 typhoons each year. \u2026 escape is all that's left. The World Bank warns that if global warming continues unimpeded, another 100 million people will be under threat. Poor people in parts of Africa and South Asia are at particular risk. Drought and flooding threaten crops - leading to hunger, disease and high food prices. Climate change often hits children the hardest, through no fault of their own. Studies have found that economic problems exacerbated by drought can have profound social impacts, such as in an increase in child marriages, for example. Families may marry off their underage daughters earlier to have fewer mouths they have to feed. Elephants produce huge quantities of manure. At Munich's Hellabrunn Zoo in Germany, one local utility is turning their waste into electric power. Around 2,000 tons of biowaste provides enough power for a hundred homes. Could this be a model for an African school? In any case, climate change is forcing new ways of thinking in the search for green energy. The Rhine River is Europe's busiest waterway for shipping - but climate change is affecting business. Ongoing drought means shipping firms would be forced to use shorter vessels that can navigate shallower waters. If ships aren't able to set off, more goods have to be transported by road - which is more expensive. Healthy coral reefs are like a blooming garden. But global warming is bleaching the life out of them. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae, which are vital to their health. But as the water heats up, they expel the algae. If warmer water temperatures persist, a lack of nutrients calcifies the corals, which makes their color fade and causes the organisms to die. Global warming also has its benefits. In recent years, wine is being produced on Germany's northernmost island, Sylt. Ever more vineyards are being established at higher altitudes and further north - even Scandinavia now has some. Global warming also means earlier harvests and sweeter grapes. Author: Karin J\u00e4ger / rr, ng \"Climate change is not an abstract concept, it is impacting huge numbers of vulnerable people,\" said MIT professor Elfatih Eltahir. \"Business as usual runs the risk of having extremely lethal heat waves.\" 'Wet-bulb temperatures' Unlike previous climate change and temperature projections, the MIT study also looked at humidity and the body's ability to cool down, as well as heat levels. The three factors make up what's called a \"wet-bulb temperature,\" which is measured by recording the temperature of the air when a wet cloth is wrapped around the thermometer. Climate scientists use this measurement to estimate how easily water can evaporate. According to climate scientists, humans can survive a wet-bulb temperature of about 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), while anything beyond could cause the body to have difficulty sweating to cool down. Such a phenomenon\u00a0could lead to heat stroke or even death within just a few hours. Putting the research findings into perspective, wet bulb temperatures have so far rarely exceeded the already hazardous level 31 degrees Celsius. It is hard to imagine conditions that are too hot for people to survive for a more than a few minutes, but that is exactly what is being discussed in this paper,\" Chris Field, a Stanford University climate scientist who was not involved in the study, told the Associated Press news agency. \"And of course, the danger threshold for punishing heat and humidity is lower for people who are ill or elderly.\" Read more:\u00a0Global warming is reshaping the world's forests South Asia's densely populated farming are likely to fare the worst; deforestation has left workers particularly exposed to the sun , while the rural surroundings leave little chance of people having access to electricity and air conditioning units.

This is one of the small actions that make a difference in the long-term - and let's be honest, it's not a big effort. Some LED bulbs consume up to 90 percent less than traditional ones. In cold or rainy countries, the task might be challenging - but these challenges are nothing compared to the worst consequences of climate change. Recycling has become normal behavior for thousands of people around the world. It definitely contributes to making a better world - but unfortunately, it is not enough. Worried about your clothes shrinking in hot water? Here another reason to keep washing with cold water: Since it avoids turning on the water heater, cold-water washing also produces less greenhouse gas emissions. Until you are ready to get rid of your car completely, you could move to a hybrid electric car. But beware: The electricity that powers it is probably still coming from dirty fossil fuels. Beef production is the largest driver of tropical deforestation worldwide, with soy production closely following - mainly to feed animals. The carbon footprint of a meat-based diet is almost double that of a vegetarian one. Even reducing the amount of meat you eat makes a difference. Renewable energies are the new trend - but we are still largely dependent on fossil fuels such as coal. In countries like Germany, you can choose your energy provider - among some that draw from renewable sources. Air travel is a major challenge when it comes to tackling climate change. Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study. But if you start now with the other nine actions, your kids might be able to live in a better world. Author: Irene Banos Ruiz World's hottest region The study also predicts that the Gulf could become the world's hottest region by 2100, due to climate change. However, citizens in the region are significantly better off financially than those in the Ganges and Indus river basins, meaning they will be able to better respond to the risks posed by relentlessly blistering temperatures. The affected South Asia reasons also rely on crops and livestock, while the oil-rich Gulf region imports almost all of its food.\u00a0 Less developed medical infrastructure in the rural regions of India , Pakistan and Bangladesh would also see diseases and infections flourish in the in the scorching temperatures, compounding the just how dangerous merely venturing outside could become in the coming decades.\u00a0 Cause for hope In the study, scientists also estimated\u00a0wet-bulb temperatures under the scenario in which concerted action was taken was to limit global warming.

The IEA roadmap charts out more than 400 milestones, including stopping the development of new coal plants All future fossil fuel projects must be scrapped\u00a0in order to meet the global target of net zero carbon emissions by mid-century, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. The recommendation\u00a0is part of a special report drafted to guide negotiators at the\u00a0COP26 climate summit scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.\u00a0 IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said the roadmap highlighted in the report showed that the path to global net-zero by 2050 was \"narrow but still achievable.\" \"The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal \u2014 our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5 C \u2014\u00a0make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,\" Birol said. In 2015, the\u00a0 Paris climate pact was agreed upon to limit the rise in temperatures as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels and avoid the most disastrous impacts of climate change.

The IEA roadmap includes\u00a0more than 400 milestones on the path to net-zero by 2050, including \"no new oil and gas fields approved for development\" beyond projects that are already committed as of 2021.

{"id": null, "body": "     Ahead of December's climate change conference, experts have warned about the effects of climate change on world security - and how fighting global warming can help foster peace. Elizabeth Bryant reports from Paris. Encroaching desert and Boko Haram extremists. A punishing drought in Syria, pushing 1 million people to flee the countryside to cities already choked with war refugees. Scarce rains and sandstorms in China, forcing the country to import massive amounts of wheat\u2026and sparking a spike in global prices that fed Egypt's 2011 revolution. Just weeks before a key climate change conference in Paris, experts and defense ministers from more than a dozen nations gathered Wednesday for a rare meeting in the French capital to confront the toxic effects of climate change on world security. \"Climate change is a threat to peace,\" said French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, describing a world where floods, desertification and droughts will intensify conflicts over ever-scarcer resources and spark a massive wave of environmental refugees. The meeting included ministers from Chad, Niger, Haiti and the Seychelles, countries that are experiencing firsthand the threats and fallout of conflicts and climate-influenced catastrophes. Benjamin Bewa-Nyog Kunbuor, Ghana's defense minister, spoke of forests where he used to play as a child now reduced to desert, rivers drying up and the country's tree cover shrinking to just a fraction of its size compared with half a century ago. \"Terrorism is significant, but naked hunger is as significant as terrorism,\" he said. \"And the relationship between terrorist activities and naked hunger are obvious. If you look at the vectors of recruitment into terrorist cells, most of the most vulnerable are hunger-prone areas.\"  Scare resources Nearly 150 nations have pledged to curb greenhouse gas emissions ahead of December's climate change summit in Paris. If carried through, experts say those cuts could limit global warming to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) - 1 degree beyond the limit at which they warn the planet could face catastrophic weather events. Ever-scarcer resources around Lake Chad mean people living on its shores are more vulnerable to Boko Haram extremists Also addressing Wednesday's meeting at the Military School in Paris, Niger's Defense Minister Mahamadou Karidjo described the nexus between climate change and the tangle of militant groups threatening the country, including Boko Haram, al-Qaida and the \"Islamic State\" group. All are directly linked to ever-scarcer resources, he said, as a creeping desert and vanishing arable land threaten the lives of millions of people. The surface area of Lake Chad - a lifeline that provides water to the four Sahel countries it straddles, including Niger - has shrunk 90 percent from its size in 1962 due to drying conditions. Scarce water has helped to intensify poverty, poverty, hunger and insecurity, Karidjo said - making people living on its shores more vulnerable to Boko Haram extremists. \"The youth no longer listen to their parents. Increasingly, they become targets for Boko Haram terrorists,\" he said. \"They become drugged, indoctrinated and return to their own villages to sow terror and insecurity.\" For his part, Defense Minister Lener Renauld of Haiti, which is threatened by massive deforestation and rising sea levels as temperatures warm, said he was convinced \"there's no plan B\" to fighting climate change.  'Urgent and growing threat' Even as experts say climate change is likely to intensify conflicts over increasingly scarce resources, they suggest mechanisms to fight global warming can help foster peace. \"Reducing our greenhouse gasses, developing renewable energy that's accessible to all countries, decarbonising our economies: engaging in energy transition is less a constraint than a chance to seize,\" said French Environment Minister Segolene Royal. Officials described Wednesday's meeting in Paris as a first, but it comes as security risks are being increasingly factored into the climate change debate. In July, a report by the US Defense Department called climate change an \"urgent and growing threat\" to national security, and this week NATO's parliament demanded stronger action by member states to tackle a warming planet. In France, EELV Green Party Senator Leila Aichi organized a meeting this week between top military brass and environmentalists. French defense officials are lagging behind the Pentagon in confronting the risks and implications of climate change, she said, but they're heading in the right direction. \"They're much more responsive on the question than politicians because they think in the long-term,\" she said. \"The army is also in much closer contact with nature.\" But, she added, security risks are not fully factored into climate change talks taking place ahead the Paris summit. Nor has the French military formally incorporated climate change into its defense strategy. Olivier Dobbels, co-founder of Polarisk, a London-based consulting group that explores future risks in the Arctic and Antarctica, said he was doubtful about the military's ability to provide answers to climate change. \"They're prepared from an operational standpoint,\" Dobbels said, drawing parallels between the military's response to climate change and peacekeeping operations in Africa and elsewhere. \"Peace enforcement, civilian protection, yes. But from a strategic standpoint, they don't have a strategy to bring solutions to climate change.\" On the eve of the G7 talks in Germany, Oxfam has released a report highlighting the devastating impact emissions from G7 countries' coal plants will have on Africa's food supply.

But it is also\u00a0refocusing on\u00a0one\u00a0particular topic left unresolved at the 2021 Glasgow climate summit: How to make rich, historically high-emitting nations foot the bill for the climate-related loss and damage inflicted on poor, vulnerable communities. The fact that the annual per capita carbon footprint in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2020 was around 0.1 tons, as opposed to\u00a0 up to 17\u00a0tons in Australia, Canada and the US, has amplified calls for climate justice. Horn of Africa nations Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan are together responsible for only 0.1% of global emissions, according to a report by the Kenya-headquartered charity\u00a0Oxfam International\u00a0that was released this week. Yet climate impacts in the region , including a long and crippling drought , have proven catastrophic for millions of inhabitants.\u00a0\u00a0 Climate vulnerable nations suffering from extreme weather say adaptation is only part of the problem, and they are demanding money for the damage already caused.  Meanwhile, the US \u2014 the highest historical emitter of greenhouse gas \u2014 refuses to admit liability\u00a0or commit\u00a0to a loss-and-damage finance mechanism.\u00a0\u00a0 That is why at the Glasgow climate summit, India, an emerging economy\u00a0with a relatively low 2 tons of per capita emissions, said it would not update its climate targets unless it were\u00a0promised $1 trillion \u00a0(\u20ac950 billion) for loss and damages by 2030.\u00a0 But will the planet burn as countries wait for payouts before making emission cuts?\u00a0 Here are 4 nations who are making their compensation case in Bonn before the business of implementation begins in Africa in November this year.\u00a0 India is a top ten historical emitter of CO2, even if its per capita emissions are around eight times lower than those of richer nations like the US and Australia.\u00a0 The country with the world's second-highest population has been vocal about the need for developed nations to compensate it for worsening climate impacts that include more frequent, severe and earlier heatwaves , water scarcity and rising seas levels. At the last climate conference, the UN states agreed to increase their reduction targets: By 2030, CO2 emissions are to be reduced by 45% compared to 2010, thus limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. At the moment, all indications are that this target will not be achieved. Patricia Espinosa, UN Executive Secretary for Climate Change, warned at the opening in Bonn, \"We urgently require political-level interventions and decisions because the world is going to have one question in Sharm El-Sheikh: What progress have you made since Glasgow?\" It is not acceptable to say that we are in challenging times, she added.. The top UN climate official warned that climate change was proceeding exponentially and that the world was on track to more than double the Paris Agreement's target of 1.5 degrees by the end of the century. Extreme heat waves, like this one in India in May, would become more frequent as a result of man-made climate change. Heavy rain and flooding, like here in the Brazilian Amazon, will also become more frequent. As Ralph Regenvanu, foreign minister of the island nation of Vanuatu, the world's most vulnerable country to natural disasters, puts it, \"The richer countries can no longer deny that they have to deal with loss and damage.\" Australia offers hope in this respect: the devastating forest fires of the past few years were one of the reasons why Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government, which was focused on the coal industry, was voted out of office. His successor Anthony Albanese has pledged to put the national response to climate change high on the agenda A garbage collector in India stands on a landfill that has ignited itself due to the heat. Symbolically, one could say that the world community is in a similar situation. Patricia Espinosa, announcing the end of her term in Bonn, urged delegates: \"Look at what we've accomplished in the last six years. Look at what we\u2019ve accomplished in the last 30. But we can do better, we must.\" Author: Philipp B\u00f6ll At the last climate summit in Glasgow, India stressed it would only update its climate targets once rich nations paid up $1 trillion.\u00a0 Prime Minister Narendra Modi did finally pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070\u00a0and reduce CO2 emissions and generate 50% of energy with renewables by decade's end.\u00a0 But in a country that generates 70% of its power with coal, its current climate targets and policies are still rated \"insufficient\" by climate think tank\u00a0Climate Action Tracker (CAT).\u00a0 India refuses to phase out coal power, saying it will only commit to a \"phase down\" as renewables come onboard. The country lobbied for this language in an effort to water down the Glasgow Climate Pact at the last minute, leaving some activists in tears .\u00a0\u00a0 As India is an emerging economy, it cannot \"compromise on development,\" said \u00a0Indian Environment and Climate Change Minister\u00a0Bhupender Yadav\u00a0in the lead-up to the Bonn conference. He insists that developed nations must commit climate finances for India to adapt to climate change, even if the South Asian powerhouse is likely to remain the world's third-highest annual carbon emitter .\u00a0\u00a0 Drought-stricken Somalia is arguably the country most impacted by climate change, as thousands of camps house people who have been displaced by extreme flooding and drought.\u00a0 In 2021, the worst locust plague in 25 years destroyed crops and livelihoods. Already poor and displaced people have become increasingly vulnerable amid an ongoing civil war. Few have the resources to eat, let alone adapt to climate change, as the worst drought in a decade increases malnutrition and threatens a famine . A report by UK-based policy institute\u00a0Chatham House\u00a0says immediate funding is needed for climate adaptation in a country on the front line of climate change. The report details how international donors helped locals repair a small dam in a displacement camp in central Somalia. Opening a canal to release river water secured drinking water and also helped small businesses to trade again.\u00a0 But such local adaptation investments are \"only a fraction of what is needed to avert the worst climate disasters,\" wrote the Chatham House authors.\u00a0 Based on the principle of climate justice, they added that \"equity demands developed countries increase commitments to, and the accessibility of, climate finance for vulnerable communities.\" Climate-induced drought in Somalia and across East Asia has created the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the last 40 years The\u00a0Central American country consistently suffers extreme weather events including drought and storms and ranks ninth in the world for level of risk to climate change impacts, according to the World Bank. These impacts are worsened by increasing deforestation and slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture that degrades land and over-exploits scarce water resources.\u00a0 As the climate crisis worsens, many men migrate and seek work in other countries like the US, meaning Guatemalan women have become central to addressing loss and damage.\u00a0 The Oxfam International report\u00a0\"Footing the Bill\" presents Heidy Ramirez as an example. Ramirez, who lost her home and crops after her village was destroyed by storms in 2020, is struggling to obtain resources for the climate emergency committee she established.\u00a0 \"We need waistcoats, life jackets, lamps, radios, backpacks, boats,\" she said of getting prepared for the next climate disaster. \"At the moment we don't have anything.\" Like India, South Africa is a large emerging economy that is heavily reliant on fossil fuels while also struggling to combat climate change.\u00a0It is also Africa's biggest CO2 emitter.\u00a0\u00a0 Some 400 people were killed in April in the East of the country when extreme rainfall triggered devastating flooding and landslides. One study identified climate change as the likely culprit. Damages have already reached the billions.\u00a0 With 90% of climate funding committed to mitigation , developing countries like South Africa want more money to help adapt to the climate crisis\u00a0and also to break an addiction to coal that powers nearly all\u00a0of the energy grid.\u00a0 At the 2021 COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, the US and several European nations, including Germany,\u00a0\u00a0 pledged $8.5 billion (\u20ac7.3 billion) to help South Africa phase out coal, expand renewable energy sources and provide green jobs.\u00a0 After the deal was done, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called it a \"watershed moment\" for South Africa and the world. \"It is proof that we can take ambitious climate action while increasing our energy security, creating jobs and harnessing new opportunities for investment, with support from developed countries,\" Ramaphosa said. If South Africa can negotiate more finance in Bonn\u00a0and increase its climate ambition at COP27, it could be a model of a just transition.\u00a0 Locusts, boosted by drought, heavy rains and warm temperatures, have devastated crops in East Africa. Pesticides can help, though they're not exactly environmentally friendly. Scientists in Nairobi have experimented with fungi and other microbes to make safer poisons. They've also used the locusts' unique smell, which changes as they mature, to break up swarms and even drive them to cannibalism. Wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity worldwide, and Africa is no exception. In Botswana, firefighters are learning the age-old techniques of Australia's northern Indigenous people. They prevent bigger fires by preemptively burning away grass and dry leaves, preserving biodiversity and reducing CO2 emissions. Angola, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique could also benefit. People in Zimbabwe are also looking to the past to plan for the future. Faced with flooding linked to climate change, some are reviving ngazi, traditional thatched homes on stilts. These elevated structures, about 2 meters (6.5 feet) above the ground, are making a comeback along the Zambezi River. They protect inhabitants from floods while keeping them cooler than brick homes. Namibia is one of southern Africa's most arid countries, and it's expecting longer, more intense droughts in the future. Windhoek, with more than 400,000 people, has already anticipated that problem. Back in 1968, the city installed the word's first water recycling plant, reclaiming sewage for drinking water in a 10-step process. Expanded in 2002, it continues to deliver a reliable water supply. Maps are crucial for helping communities prepare for increased risks of flooding, landslides and storms linked to climate change. And, yet, many African maps are rarely updated \u2014 even in urban areas, where rapid unplanned growth can stay hidden for years. Drones can help planners get an updated view, while machine learning uses satellite data to develop risk maps for cities and agricultural areas. Hydroponics, raising plants without soil, has allowed some farmers to grow crops with very little water or space. It's a great option for Africa's arid regions, but such setups require a constant supply of electricity \u2014 not ideal in places with frequent power outages. Two mechanical engineering students in South Africa have designed a new pipe system that only requires power for four hours a day. Farms in low-lying areas such as Egypt's Nile Delta are threatened by rising seas and salty water. Some people have begun to look to China (above) for ideas on how to raise fish and grow plants in the same space. Aquaponics helps preserve scarce fresh water, and crops benefit from fish waste fertilizer. To adapt, researchers are looking for plants and fish species more suited to brackish water.

{"id": null, "body": "     Last year's record temperatures would not have been possible without climate change, a study has found. Scientists say it's the first time they've been able to attribute specific weather events to human activities. The research, published Wednesday in the Bulletin of the\u00a0American Meteorological Society (BAMS) , concluded that the 2016 global heat record would not have been possible in a preindustrial climate. The international team of scientists also found that last year's\u00a0 extreme temperatures in Asia and unusually warm waters off the coast of Alaska were a direct result of human-driven fossil fuel emissions. \"This report marks a fundamental change,\" BAMS editor-in-chief Jeff Rosenfeld said. While scientists have long known that climate change may have increased the chances of certain floods, droughts, storms and other extreme events, it hadn't yet been pegged as the sole cause. \"Finding multiple extreme events that weren't even possible without human influence makes clear that we're experiencing new weather, because we've made a new climate,\" Rosenfeld said. Extreme events The study presented 27 peer-reviewed analyses of extreme weather across five continents and two oceans in 2016. More than 100 scientists from 18 countries took part in the research. India's 2016 heat wave killed hundreds of people The earth's mean surface temperature broke records last year , something that was \"only possible due to substantial centennial-scale anthropogenic warming,\" the report said. Researchers also said the heat wave that swept Asia last year, claiming more than 500 lives in India , was caused by climate change. Ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea and off northern Australia were the highest in 35 years of satellite records. The warming waters resulted in \" massive bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef and one of the largest harmful algal blooms ever off the Alaska shore,\" according to the report. The researchers concluded that it was \"extremely unlikely that natural variability alone led to the observed anomalies.\" Some 10,500 firefighters were called to tackle forest fires in California in 2015. They were unable to prevent 1,400 homes from destruction. The blaze was fueled by hot and dry weather - as a result of climate change. The polar bear has become a symbol of climate change, as its habitat is threatened by global warming. The Arctic predator hunts from ice sheets that are fast disappearing. As the ice retreats, they are unable to stalk their prey, and risk starvation. By 2050, scientists warn that the Arctic could be ice-free in summer. Just visible from the air is a little wood hut on the island of Spitzbergen in Norway. It is home to the Arctic research base where French and German scientists are studying climatic and atmospheric changes in the polar region, including the damage done to permafrost and glacier systems. A goat watches a mountain expedition on the Swiss Aletsch Glacier, a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was around a kilometer longer in 1860 than it is today. Due to global warming, the glacier is shrinking by up to 50 meters per year. With the rate of retreat increasing, scientists fear Europe's biggest glacier could disappear altogether. \u2026 the landscape looks peaceful, bathed in a mystical light. But the actual situation is far more unsettling. This aerial view shows Central Luzon in the Philippines, completely flooded after it was hit by a typhoon and heavy rain. People were drowned or buried under landslides, and half a million were forced to flee their homes. The country is hit by 20 typhoons each year. \u2026 escape is all that's left. The World Bank warns that if global warming continues unimpeded, another 100 million people will be under threat. Poor people in parts of Africa and South Asia are at particular risk. Drought and flooding threaten crops - leading to hunger, disease and high food prices. Climate change often hits children the hardest, through no fault of their own. Studies have found that economic problems exacerbated by drought can have profound social impacts, such as in an increase in child marriages, for example. Families may marry off their underage daughters earlier to have fewer mouths they have to feed. Elephants produce huge quantities of manure. At Munich's Hellabrunn Zoo in Germany, one local utility is turning their waste into electric power. Around 2,000 tons of biowaste provides enough power for a hundred homes. Could this be a model for an African school? In any case, climate change is forcing new ways of thinking in the search for green energy. The Rhine River is Europe's busiest waterway for shipping - but climate change is affecting business. Ongoing drought means shipping firms would be forced to use shorter vessels that can navigate shallower waters. If ships aren't able to set off, more goods have to be transported by road - which is more expensive. Healthy coral reefs are like a blooming garden. But global warming is bleaching the life out of them. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae, which are vital to their health. But as the water heats up, they expel the algae. If warmer water temperatures persist, a lack of nutrients calcifies the corals, which makes their color fade and causes the organisms to die. Global warming also has its benefits. In recent years, wine is being produced on Germany's northernmost island, Sylt. Ever more vineyards are being established at higher altitudes and further north - even Scandinavia now has some. Global warming also means earlier harvests and sweeter grapes. Author: Karin J\u00e4ger / rr, ng nm/se (AFP, dpa) Eco-advice can be overwhelming \u2014 and often ineffective.

{"id": null, "body": "     The EU has earmarked millions of euros for supporting climate friendly development in Southeast Asia. But the EU's climate diplomacy in the region is up against economic growth fueled by dirty energy. ASEAN countries have increased coal consumption in recent years After the European Union became a \"strategic partner\" of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc in December 2020, both blocs pledged to make climate change policy a key area of cooperation. The EU, already the largest provider of development assistance to the ASEAN region, has committed millions of euros to various environmental programs. This includes \u20ac5 million ($5.86 million) to the ASEAN Smart Green Cities initiative and another \u20ac5 million towards a new means of preventing deforestation, called the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade in ASEAN. Along with multilateral assistance, the EU also works with individual ASEAN member states on eco-friendly policies\u00a0like Thailand's Bio-Circular-Green Economic Model and Singapore's Green Plan 2030. For years, the EU has been working on climate action in Southeast Asia by organizing dialogues and technical assistance projects. Igor Driesmans, the EU's ASEAN ambassador recently said the two blocs would soon start a \"dedicated dialogue\" on clean energy transition. However, Brussels faces an uphill struggle to turn around the region's environmental policy. \"The EU has been somewhat proactive in engaging with Southeast Asia on tackling climate change, but overall Southeast Asia is going in the wrong direction in many areas on climate change,\" Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, told DW. Five ASEAN states were among the fifteen countries most affected by climate change between 1999\u20132018, according to the Climate Risk Index 2020. As a fast-developing region, where economic growth, urbanization and domestic consumption rates are expected to spike in the coming decades, Southeast Asia's energy demand is projected to grow 60% by 2040. This will contribute to a two-thirds rise in CO2 emissions to almost 2.4 gigatons, according to the Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2019. Of the numerous environmental problems facing the region, perhaps the most consequential is the continuing uptake of coal for electricity generation , said Nithi Nesadurai, the regional coordinator of Climate Action Network Southeast Asia. \"This is contributing to rising emissions and does not augur well for the region, even as the share of renewable energy in the energy mix increases at marginal levels,\u201d he told DW. Southeast Asia is one of the few areas of the world where coal usage has increased in the past decade. In 2019, the region consumed around 332 million tons of coal, nearly double the consumption from a decade earlier, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Of that, Indonesia accounted for 42% and Vietnam nearly a third. In 2019, the region's imports of thermal coal rose by 19% compared with the previous year, according to an IEA report. Energy generated from coal doubled in the Philippines between 2011 and 2018, when it accounted for 53% of energy consumption, according to the country's Department of Energy. Coal is expected to account for more than 50% of Vietnam\u2019s energy supply by 2030, the World Coal Association, an industry body, predicts. Even Laos, which has built hundreds of hydropower dams over the past decade, saw coal-fired energy production rise from almost nothing to 10,000 GWh in 2017. In February, Laos' deputy minister of energy and mines, Daovong Phoneke, announced that two new coal-fired energy plants, with investments worth up to $4 billion, will open by the end of the year, mostly to export energy to neighboring countries. According to a study published in November in the journal of Energy and Climate Change, coal-fired energy will overtake natural gas as the main power source in the ASEAN region by 2030. And by 2040 it could account for almost 50% of the region's projected CO2 emissions. However, coal-fired power production is rarely, if ever, mentioned by the EU in its climate policy in Southeast Asia. After the second EU-ASEAN High-Level Dialogue on Environment and Climate Change in November, a post-dialogue statement by the two blocs did not reference coal-fired energy. Neither is coal mentioned in detail in the Blue Book 2020, a 47-page guide that lays out EU-ASEAN partnership. \"The mix of a strong research base, policy advice, feasibilities for collaboration, and access to finance should help them to cope with the transition,\" said Driesmans, the EU ambassador, referring to the ASEAN bloc's climate change activity. \"As part of the forthcoming dialogue on Clean Energy between the EU and ASEAN, we hope to be able to support ASEAN in its energy transition, including all relevant aspects: renewable energy, energy efficiency, grid integration, climate finance and coal phase out.,\" he added. The EU tends to take a more subtle approach. The EU-Vietnam free trade agreement, which came into effect last year, commits Vietnam to making efforts towards renewable energy production but there is no explicit mention of limiting its coal-fired energy consumption. \"The EU should be more proactive in trying to help Southeast Asian states wean themselves off of coal-fired plants,\" said Kurlantzick. \"Of course, this is on the Southeast Asian states as well, and also on China, which is essentially exporting coal-fired plants,\" he added.\u00a0 Indeed, if the EU takes a strong forceful stance on coal consumption in the region, it could spark anger from the main exporters of the commodity, China, India and Australia. Brussels' climate change policy in the region has already been met with resistance.\u00a0 Indonesia last year initiated proceedings at the World Trade Organization against the EU's phased ban on palm-oil imports . Brussels contends the ban is to protect the environment, but Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil producer, says it is mere protectionism. Malaysia, the world\u2019s second-largest palm oil producer, has vowed to stand with Jakarta in its battle against the EU. In the latest State of Southeast Asian survey, published in February by Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, some 43% of respondents said they trusted the EU because of its stance on the environment, human rights, and climate change. However, 15.1% said they distrusted the EU for this reason, believing its environmental policy could threaten their country's interests and sovereignty. The other problem for the EU is that it risks accusations of hypocrisy if it takes too forceful a stance on coal-fired energy production in Southeast Asia. \"It must show leadership by example. It cannot pressure countries in Southeast Asia to shift away from coal when it is struggling to do the same in some countries in the EU,\" said Nesadurai, from Climate Action Network Southeast Asia. Production and consumption of coal have dropped massively in the EU in recent decades. Hard coal consumption fell from 300 million tons in 1999 to 176 million tons in 2019, roughly half of the Southeast Asian coal consumption rate that year, according to EU data. But Poland and the Czech Republic remain dependent on coal-fired energy production, although the former contributed to almost 95% of the EU\u2019s total hard coal production by 2019. And, according \u00a0 to the International Energy Agency, Southeast Asia and Europe each accounted for around 11% of the world\u2019s thermal coal imports in 2019. \"I think Southeast Asian countries would welcome [more] EU aid,\" said Kurlantzick. \"But I don't know that they are going to change their reliance on coal fired plants.\" \n Vietnam's response to the pandemic is widely viewed as among the most effective in the world. Its ruling Communist Party is set to hold a congress that will select new leadership and shape policy for the next five years.\n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Can the EU's climate change plan work in Southeast Asia?", "article_name": "can-the-eus-climate-change-plan-work-in-southeast-asia", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/can-the-eus-climate-change-plan-work-in-southeast-asia/a-57062423", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 8018, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:05.375049"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change is having a huge impact on Afghanistan's agriculture-based society. Despite changing environment patterns, Afghan farmers have a limited understanding of how climate change is affecting their livelihood. For generations, Salman Mohammadi's family has worked on a farm in the Lal Wa Sar Jangal district in Afghanistan's central Ghor province. Mohammadi inherited the family farm from his father, who had received it from his ancestors. The 32-year-old farmer cultivated vegetables and rice on his farm, storing a portion of the harvest for his family and selling the rest for money. The farming, he recalls, was hard but the life was simple. \"There was enough to eat, and we earned enough money to buy other things that we could not grow on the farm,\" Mohammadi told DW. But things started to change in the past few years as Mohammadi noticed a disturbance in the rain and snowfall patterns. The problems for him and many other Afghan farmers peaked during the 2008 drought that hit parts of the country. The livelihood of almost 85 percent of the Afghan population - living in rural areas and largely dependent on agriculture - has been severely affected in the past few decades due to prolonged droughts and declining water sources. \"Our problems increased due to bad harvests,\" Mohammadi said, adding that he had to give up on his family occupation and leave his village because he could not make both ends meet. \"I was not able feed my family, so I moved to Kabul,\" Mohammadi said. Mohammadi's case is not unique. Over the past decades, many Afghan farmers have had to leave farming and move to the capital Kabul to earn a living. Although\u00a0the worsening security is one of the reasons behind this exodus, climate change, too, plays a role. Read also: Climate change could make South Asia too hot for human survival by 2100 Water scarcity in Pakistan \u2013 A bigger threat than terrorism Creating climate awareness is a challenge Mohammadi, as well as other farmers, are unaware of the impact of climate change on their lives. Most of them attribute it to the will of god. \"Climate change and environment protection are relatively new concepts for Afghans, but we are trying to raise awareness about them,\" Samim Hoshmand, an official at the National Environment Protection Agency, told DW. \"Our awareness campaign can help farmers undertake certain measures to protect themselves from the negative effects of the global climate change,\" Hoshmand added. Afghanistan only contributes 0.06 percent of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions, but it is among the countries most vulnerable to changes associated with climate change, according to a 2016 study, titled\u00a0Climate Change in Afghanistan: Perspectives and Opportunities, carried out by Heinrich B\u00f6ll Stiftung Afghanistan. As harvesting in Afghanistan mostly involves traditional methods, farmers are unaware about the modern techniques with which they can cope with climate change. Afghan\u00a0officials also have to deal with a number of cultural and religious taboos when educating farmers about global warming and climate change phenomena. For example, Mohammadi believes his country is experiencing less rainfall because \"god is punishing\" them for the ongoing violence and war. Also, Mohammadi is not interested in understanding the reasons behind the changing weather patterns. It is certainly not his top priority as he has to deal with the harsh city life in Kabul.

{"id": null, "body": "     Illegal refrigerant imports are flooding the European market, contributing emissions equivalent to four coal-fired power plants in 2018. These hydrofluorocarbons, also known as HFCs, primarily come from China. Illegal importers in the European Union are raking in the money, says Alessandro Borri \u2014 and he's not talking about drugs. The sales director at Italian refrigerant supplier General Gas is referring to the importers of illegal hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), gases that are used in nearly every car air conditioner, heat pump and refrigerator. \"The cost of a cylinder imported from China, including transport, is about $70 [\u20ac63],\" says Borri. \"They are imported in shipping\u00a0containers; one container can hold up to 900 cylinders, and then they are distributed via Facebook or eBay. But also by people with a van, they just go from workshop to workshop and sell them one by one.\" Read more: \u00a0 Illegal wildlife trade thrives on Facebook, internet forums On eBay or other local online retailers, an illegally imported cylinder costs between \u20ac180 and \u20ac250. With those prices, the legal market for HFCs just can't keep up. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are used in most modern refrigerators and air conditioners. And while EU lawmakers are increasingly concerned about the bloc's carbon emissions and their contribution to climate change, this flourishing black market of illegal HFC imports, and the HFCs still allowed under current EU regulations, are also contributing to the exacerbation of the climate crisis. HFCs, manmade gases that can drift around the atmosphere for decades, have a huge impact on global warming. The most common HFCs are between 675 and 3,922 times more harmful to the climate than carbon dioxide, according to report released earlier this year by the London-based NGO Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). Other fluorinated gases, some of which are used as propellants in spray foam or insulating material, can be up to 24,000 times more damaging than CO2. Read more: \u00a0 Net-zero by 2050: What does it mean? The EU set out in 2015 to regulate fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) and gradually take them off the market. By 2030, it plans to reduce the use of HFCs by up to 80% \u2014 but there's still a long way to go to meet that mark. EU struggling to regulate imports According to the EIA, HFC gases equivalent to around 117 million tons of CO2 moved through the European market last year. But the EU quota for 2018 only allowed a maximum of 101 million tons. Read more: \u00a0 Does Germany's weak climate plan reflect a polarized public? Doing the math, it becomes clear that HFCs equivalent to around 16 million tons of CO2 illegally flooded the European market in 2018 \u2014 emissions comparable to the fumes billowing out of four coal-fired power plants or 4 million cars. Discrepancies in import and export data pinpoint China, the world's largest producer of F-gases, as the country of origin, according to the EIA report. \"What we found was a huge discrepancy between what we were seeing coming into the EU compared to what EU companies were reporting,\" said Sophie Geoghegan, a climate campaigner with the London-based EIA. \"And there is also a discrepancy between Chinese exports to the EU and EU imports from China.\" Read more: \u00a0 China's push for more coal power imperils climate goals China is the world's largest producer of HFCs, and the EU is its largest export market. Among its major European customers is the auto industry. In 2018, around 8 million cars were produced in Germany, Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom alone. And while the latest models now in dealerships use less damaging refrigerants, air-conditioning systems in vehicles currently on the road generally make use of highly polluting HFCs. Smuggling networks Importers often smuggle HFCs into Europe using disposable cylinders hidden in cars or trucks, crossing via land borders from Russia and Ukraine and into Poland, or through Turkey and on into Bulgaria, Greece, Croatia and Italy. From there, it's distributed to factories and workshops throughout the EU, according to the EIA. These workshops can include, for example, individual traders or service stations that specialize in repairing refrigerators or refilling air-conditioning refrigerant in vehicles. Earlier this year, two such shipments from China were intercepted in Hamburg, the city-state's authority for environment and energy told DW. The smugglers have found a market over the last year, ever since the introduction of a quota on HFCs in the EU in mid-2018 led to a scarcity. A huge demand remained, and as a result, the official market price for refrigerants ballooned by an estimated 800%. The quota was the EU's attempt to force the market to replace HFCs with \"climate-friendly alternatives,\" a European Commission spokesman told DW. But it had an unintended result: importers could suddenly earn lots of money with cheap, illegal product. \"When the gas cylinders suddenly cost \u20ac700, we bought cheaper cylinders on eBay,\" says the head of a small shop that specializes in cooling systems in western Germany, who did not want to be named. In such a small operation, with only a few employees, the price of refrigerant is critical, he says. \"Our profits naturally depend on the price of the refrigerants.\" To this day, the company regularly receives emails from Germany and abroad with HFC sales pitches. An example of a cyclinder of HFC for a car air conditioning system for sale on Italian e-commerce network Subito But these small cylinders only account for a portion of the smuggled HFCs.\u00a0ISO tanks, large standardized shipping containers, bring much of the illegal imports to Europe. Legal importers are abusing the system and exceeding their quota allowance, taking advantage of inefficient, outdated customs controls which can't keep track of incoming HFCs. 'Serious gaps in the system' Krzysztof Grzegorczyk of Prozon, a Polish foundation for climate protection, blames the illegal imports on \"serious gaps in the system.\" \"Today, if you have, for example, a quota of one container [in the EU \u2014 Editor's note], in fact you can bring 10 containers. Ten times one container,\" he says, pointing out that incomplete record-keeping can allow importers to bring in more HFCs than permitted by EU law. \"Customs authorities have to wait until the end of the year, when all companies self-report how much they imported, and then they can check against customs data,\" says Geoghegan of the EIA. \"But this is obviously not working.\" In order to better identify illegal imports, she says \"all customs need special training, especially in EU border countries.\" Polish customs officers are trained in how to detect illegally imported HFC gases In Poland, a hot spot for illegal imports, Prozon has led such training programs in cooperation with the government and the customs authorities, and has already seen some initial success. Just last month, Polish customs authorities uncovered some 1,200 cylinders filled with refrigerants in an illegal shipment, a total of 13 tons of HFC gases. A few months ago, officials intercepted a delivery of 26 tons. In Germany, those caught selling F-gases in disposable cylinders can face a prison sentence of up to two years, or a fine of up to \u20ac50,000 (about $55,000). But other EU member states have yet to implement the EU's F-gas regulation, or have done so only in a limited capacity, and fines for offenses have either been too low or non-existent. Earlier this year, the EU issued both Italy and Romania a formal notice; neither country\u00a0has\u00a0reported any progress on the implementation of the regulation. A fraction of the cargo Polish customs seized from an illegal shipment in September 2019 Plans for new electronic monitoring system Legal producers of HFC gases are looking to shut down the smugglers as quickly as possible. One HFC multinational, that did not want to be identified, told DW that they had already shared information on illegal imports with OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. OLAF, which investigates customs and tax offenses as well as corruption and fraud within the EU authorities, wouldn't comment on any ongoing investigations. The European Commission told the EU it was \"concerned\" about the failure to implement the F-gas regulation, and said it was \"doing it's utmost to tackle illegal trade.\" From 2020 onward, the EU wants to introduce a Europewide electronic system \"that will allow an automatic check to see if an economic operator is registered, and to flag to climate authorities those operators that may not have sufficient quota.\" The German Environment Agency expects that, without more regulation, F-gases will account for about 8% of global climate-related emissions by 2050. And yet, Geoghegan believes the EU continues to be a pioneer when it comes to regulation. \"There is no other country I know of that is this far regarding this topic, in terms of quota or bans,\" she said. Implementation, however, remains a challenge \u2014 and all the while, the black market for refrigerants continues to grow. In early September, environmental agencies in Brazil began noticing crude oil washing up on more than 100 beaches in nine northeastern states, from Maranhao in the north down to Bahia. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles announced this week that more than 100 tons of oil have been collected from along the 3,000-kilometer (1,860-mile) coastline in the last month. Its origins remain unknown. On October 8, President Jair Bolsonaro said the mysterious oil slicks were likely the result of a criminal act. Earlier speculation had suggested a possible shipwreck or offshore oil platform accident. \"We have on our radar screen a country that could be the origin of the oil,\" Bolsonaro said, though he declined to give any names while the investigation was still underway. Brazil has extensive offshore oil exploration activity, but state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) has said molecular tests on samples showed they weren't compatible with the oils produced and sold by the company. According to media reports, the source of the spill may be oil platforms off Venezuela, but there have been no reported issues from that region. Petrobras has said the company's environmental crews have worked on beach cleanup operations in eight states, at the request of environmental protection agency Ibama. The agency has said oil-coated birds and sea turtles have been washing up along the shore and are being treated. Baby turtle hatchlings, just now emerging from their shells, are also under threat. Federal police, the Justice Ministry and the Brazilian navy have joined the investigation into the source of the spill. A shipwreck or other accident has been ruled out, but some experts believe the source may be an oil tanker that cleaned its tanks on the busy route between the southern Caribbean and Asia. The state of Sergipe, which relies heavily on tourism, has been especially hard hit. The spilled crude oil has forced fishers and beachgoers to stay away from the contaminated areas. Brazil's resorts and beaches are world-renowned and attract millions of locals and foreigners every year, especially from Spain and Portugal. Locals have said it's the worst spill in decades. Major cities along the affected coast include Sao Luis, Fortaleza, Recife (above) and Salvador.

{"id": null, "body": "     At a summit starting Thursday, the European Union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change, with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Summit host Merkel will be hoping leaders won't run into rough weather over key issues Meeting in Brussels for a two-day gathering, EU heads of state and government will seek to hammer out a united energy strategy aimed at diversifying sources while reducing pollution. In the run-up to the meeting, EU leaders have cranked up the rhetoric about the need for tough action to tackle global warming, although some environmentalists say that proposed targets do not go far enough. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who will host European leaders for the first time under Germany's EU presidency, stressed the urgency of their task by warning that Europe was at an \"important crossroads.\" \"If we act decisively now, we have a chance of effectively counteracting the dangers of climate change,\" she said in her invitation to the summit. Gore says the EU is vital to leading the way on green issues Merkel told the British Financial Times newspaper on Wednesday that she wanted \"Europe to take a 'pioneering lead' on meaningful green initiatives.\" Merkel was seconded by former US Vice President, Al Gore who recently picked up an Oscar for his documentary on the ravages of global warming. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Brussels to address a conference on biofuels, Gore said a European lead on the issue was vital. \"I'm trying to get my country to change its policies, but in the meantime the European Union is absolutely key to helping the world make the change it must,\" he said. Securing energy supplies Time for an energy rethink in Europe? British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that Europe should not only show leadership on combating climate change, but also beef up the security of energy supplies while opening the market to more competition. \"I think there is the real possibility of showing how Europe can lead the debate on climate change, on energy security, and on deregulation in the interest of a more competitive European economy,\" Blair said on Tuesday in London. EU leaders are expected to endorse plans to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 20 percent by 2020, from 1990 levels, and by 30 percent if other developed and emerging economies, particularly China and India, join them. The European Union produces about 14 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions while the United States, the world's largest polluter, produces some 25 percent. Although the summit is expected to provide a show of unity, tensions are brewing under the surface over the role of nuclear energy and the use of renewable energy sources. One of the liveliest debates is expected on whether to set a binding target of renewable energy sources meeting 20 percent of Europe's energy needs by 2020, after foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on Monday. Environmentalists: \"It's not enough\" Although Europe is leading efforts to combat climate change, some environmentalists warned that the EU leaders are not aiming high enough. Diesel engines are popular in Europe, sooty particles in the exhaust are not \"The EU's energy action plan ... will fall a long way short in making Europe's energy more sustainable unless targets for both renewable share and reducing greenhouse gases are raised and tightened,\" said Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Jan Kowalzig. Energy policy has climbed to the top of the EU political agenda over the last year as oil price spikes and cuts in gas and oil supplies from Russia have spurred the bloc to forge a common strategy to meeting their needs. However, despite the growing importance attached to energy, the EU has struggled to hammer out a common approach, with member countries often putting national interests first, much to the frustration of the European Commission. Increasing competition Such is the case with a European Commission idea to inject greater competition into the EU energy market with plans to make large, integrated gas and power companies split their generating and distribution networks. Leaders are likely to send the plan back to the drawing board with France and to a lesser extent Germany opposed to the idea, which could cause a major shake-up of French and German energy groups. The summit comes amid a shifting European political landscape with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi emerging shaken from a recent crisis, British Prime Minister Tony Blair increasingly a lame duck, and looming French presidential elections in April and May. It will also be French President Jacques Chirac's last chance to leave his mark on EU policy-making after nearly 12 years in office fiercely defending French interests during meetings with EU leaders. Looking ahead as Germany chairs the Group of Eight industrial nations this year, Merkel will likely want to take the conclusions of this week's meetings into the G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany in June. EU environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels.

{"id": null, "body": "     Heavy rain and storms exacerbated by climate change particularly affected East Africa, Asia and South America in 2019, according to the latest Climate Risk Index. Rains have flooded cities that were still being rebuilt a year after Cyclone Idai devastated Mozambique Violent storms caused more damage than any other type of extreme weather in 2019, with poorest nations bearing the brunt, according to a study published Monday by environmental organization Germanwatch. Made stronger by climate change, they wreaked havoc across the world. \"On the one hand, there was Cyclone Idai on the southeast coast of Africa, which caused damage in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi; and, on the other hand, a hurricane in the Caribbean that hit the Bahamas,\" said David Eckstein, a policy advisor at Germanwatch and co-author of the report, which has been published each year since 2006. More than 1,000 people lost their lives\u00a0 Idai in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi in March 2019, causing \"catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis,\" the authors wrote. The global index is based on data from the German reinsurance company Munich Re. It compares the number of deaths and property damage caused by extreme weather to the number of inhabitants and the gross domestic product of the country in which it strikes. Cyclone Idai was more devastating than similar-strength storms that year because of a lack of early-warning systems Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas in 2019 and unleashed flooding that reached up to 8 meters in some areas Japan was also hit hard by Typhoon Hagibis, which killed 290 people. Prolonged rainfall caused more than 2,200 deaths in India. Several hundred people also died in Afghanistan, South Sudan and Niger as heavy rains triggered landslides and destroyed homes. In Bolivia, heavy rains led to flooding;\u00a034 people died and 23,000 families were left homeless. Fires also destroyed 2\u00a0million hectares of forest, grassland and protected areas. While storms have always claimed lives and damaged homes, they are \"increasing in intensity, and that can be attributed to climate change,\" said Eckstein. \"We did interviews with people from Mozambique who said that there have always been cyclones on the southeast coast of Africa, but never with the ferocity as in 2019 with Idai.\" Bolivia's Pantanal was ravaged by wildfires in 2019 and again in 2020 In 2019, all 10\u00a0of the countries most severely affected by extreme weather suffered from heavy floods, according to the report. Last year, large amounts of rain hit eight of the 10\u00a0most-affected countries, while two others, Germany and Canada, were exposed to extreme heat. \"The rain actually causes the most damage in a cyclone due to the extreme amounts of water,\" said Eckstein. \"Climate change plays a special role in this on several levels.\" One reason for the increase in rain is that the sea and the air are getting warmer as the planet heats. Warm air holds more moisture, which means more rain. Climate scientists say storms are not becoming more common, but, rather, stronger. The report projects that the number of tropical cyclones that are classed as severe will increase with every tenth of a degree rise in average global\u00a0temperature.\u00a0 In 2002, a so-called 100-year flood put large parts of Dresden under water \u2014 and threatened numerous cultural treasures. The baroque Zwinger palace was also flooded. The city founded a task force to be prepared for future extreme weather events. Today there are global efforts underway to use climate modelling to better plan for the protection of cultural monuments in the future. The city, built on islands, struggles against the influences of water anyway, but climate change means that natural disasters such as the 2019 floods will become more frequent. The recital hall of the opera (above) was under water, as were palaces and churches. Researchers are not only examining such extreme weather events, but also the long-term effects of climate change. In the past, high humidity was a particular problem for cultural assets. Now, it is the increasingly dry air. This is also the case in the baroque Moritzburg castle in Saxony, where there is a large collection of baroque leather wallpapers. Their paintings have already been extensively refurbished, as they showed damage such as shrinkage cracks. These can be traced to periods of extreme heat. A historical city wall encircles the city of Gubbio in Italy's central Umbria region. Like the palazzo and its archaeological excavations, the wall is threatened by shifting foundations and moisture. Part of the city wall collapsed after rain loosened the mortar and stones fell out. A European research team is using electromagnetic scans to assess the structural health of the ancient monuments. The fortress of Koules stands guard at the entrance to the Cretan capital's harbor, as it has since the early 16th century. Although it has withstood a lot over the centuries, changing wave patterns are now eroding the building. Climate change has caused a change in wind patterns, altering the wave direction. The salt water penetrates and erodes the walls, damaging the monument. The UNESCO World Heritage Site has existed for more than 4,000 years. Now moles churn the ground in such a way that it threatens to collapse in the long term. Behind this is a climate-related cycle: Mild winters increase the mole population and earthworms, a preferred food for moles, multiply due to warmer and more humid soil conditions. Heavy rains also saturate the soil. Wismar's old town, with its historic gabled buildings and waterworks (see photo) is as culturally important as the old towns of L\u00fcbeck and Stralsund. In the long term, all three cities are threatened by rising sea levels. If global warming continues unchecked, future archaeologists will have to search for our heritage underwater. The city centers of Naples, Bruges and Istanbul are also at risk. Climate change affects more than just buildings and the treasures housed within. Historic parks and gardens, such as the one surrounding the Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam near Berlin, must also be prepared for new climatic conditions. Several projects are testing models to improve the resistance of plants, as well as adjusting the planted species to better withstand new climatic conditions. Author: Torsten Landsberg Since 2000, more than 475,000 people have died in more than 11,000 extreme weather events, according to the report. Eight of the 10\u00a0countries hardest-hit between 2000 and 2019 are poorer nations. \"They are the hardest-hit because they are more vulnerable to the damaging effects of a hazard and have a lower coping capacity,\" said report co-author Vera Kuenzel. These countries have less money to build back than industrial countries. \"Countries like Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan are repeatedly affected by extreme weather events and do not have time to fully recover before the next event occurs,\" says Kuenzel. \"Strengthening their resilience must therefore not only address adaptation, but also provide the necessary support to deal with loss and damage.\" Historic polluter Germany built another power plant last year to burn coal Most developing countries have contributed little to the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere and bear less responsibility for the damages of global warming than historic emitters like the US and Germany. \"Now, however, they urgently need financial and technical support to adapt to the consequences as far as possible,\" said Eckstein. The rise in CO2 in the atmosphere has mostly been caused by industrialized countries burning coal, oil and gas. But so far, the energy companies that\u00a0profited from this have not paid anything for the damage that has followed. Leaders of industrialized countries have promised poorer countries $100 billion (\u20ac82.3 billion) in climate finance each year from 2020 to cope with the crises. But \"recent studies show that the $100 billion per year pledged by industrialized nations is not being met and only a small part of it has been allocated to climate adaptation,\" said Eckstein.\u00a0\u00a0 That might soon change. Former US President Donald Trump, who stopped all US payments to the International Climate Fund, took the country out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. But within hours of taking office last week, President Biden signed an executive order for the US to rejoin. \"We hope that there will be a positive change in position and that the US will significantly revise the climate protection goals formulated under Obama upward,\" said Eckstein. \"We also hope that a dynamic is sparked between the US, China and the EU.\" The pandemic shows how important financial aid is for many countries, said Laura Schaefer of Germanwatch. Risks in different areas, such as health and the economy, are closely linked. In the future, \"it will be important to improve the crisis resilience of these countries \u2014 especially climate resilience.\" This article was adapted from German.\u00a0\n    \nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent(\n'promio-pym-container',\n'https://system.promio-connect.com/register/16401/default/en/newsletter-form',\n{}\n);\n  Extreme weather events linked to climate change can cause major damage \u2014 destroying homes and livelihoods.

The Fridays for Future movement has been extremely popular in the Netherlands. Over a million people have been reported as protesting in Italy, with 20,000 in the city of Turin. Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti urged teachers not to punish students who skipped class. A protester blocks the street in Lausanne, Switzerland to stop police vehicles from getting through. The Fridays for Future movement in Switzerland has been relatively small compared to other European countries. In Berlin, where an estimated 100,000 people came to the streets last week, the protests have taken on a major political dimension. Huge puppets of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz exemplified general dissatisfaction with how politicians have dealt with climate change issues and a national climate plan the government released last week. Where Greta Thunberg first began the climate protest by herself over a year ago, thousands of protesters took to the street on Friday. Thunberg, who addressed the UN this week, will soon make her way to South America for a UN climate conference. Protesters in Israel donned red as they took to the streets.

Gas projects are still possible, but would have to be based on what the bank called \"new technologies,\" such as carbon capture and storage , combining heat and power generation or mixing in renewable gases with the fossil natural gas. \"This is an important first step \u2014\u00a0this is not the last step,\" the EIB's vice president, Andrew McDowell told reporters in a call. Combating climate change The ban on funding will come into effect a year later than originally proposed after lobbying by European Union member states, the bank's shareholders. The policy change will also see the EIB prioritize lending for energy efficiency, low carbon technology and grid improvements. It comes at a time when the EU is trying to ratchet up its climate efforts. Last week, EU finance ministers unanimously backed the phasing out of funding of gas, oil and coal projects to help combat climate change. Earlier Thursday, German\u00a0Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told diplomats and scientists in Berlin that \"Europe must lead, because only then other countries such as China or India will stay the course too.''

{"id": null, "body": "     Senegalese coastal villages are affected by climate change and overfishing. While many men leave to seek employment abroad, women often stay behind and try to adapt to life between rising sea levels and desertification. Almata Diagne and four of her six children have taken cover from the sun beneath a makeshift tent on the beach in Ndiebene Gandiol, western Senegal. The oldest daughter, Magat, carries her\u00a04-month-old sister\u00a0in a shawl on her back\u00a0while she helps her mother put the fish they've just bought\u00a0 from a middleman\u00a0 into a bucket. Later, Almata will take them to\u00a0market in the larger town of Saint-Louis. Read more: \u00a0\u00a0 Senegal's vanishing villages The average of roughly 10 euros ($11)\u00a0a day she makes from selling the fish\u00a0supplements what her husband Babacar Jo is able to send from his salary in Spain. He left for Europe in 2006, when Almata was married to someone else. After they divorced, she and Babacar were able to wed during one of his return visits to Gandiol, but even as man and wife, they rarely see each other. He spends most of the year in Spain , supporting not only his two wives and children but also his parents from afar. Fishermen from the coastline villages in Senegal have struggled to maintain their livelihoods in the face of overfishing and climate change. Like Almata's husband, Babacar, many have left their villages to seek work elsewhere. \"We receive about 30,000 West African CFA Francs (\u20ac46) from him every two to three months,\u201d says Almata, adding that it's hard for him to earn enough money for everybody. She knows she cannot fully rely on him.

The bonds are stronger with your own family than with your wife.\" She told DW that women in rural areas understand they have to work, and \"can't just be waiting for the money from their husbands.\" Empty waters Babacar is one of many men who left the small village of Ndi\u00e9b\u00e8ne Gandiol, where the shoreline is now dotted with abandoned homes that were\u00a0destroyed by flooding\u00a0or erosion caused by rising sea levels. Arona Fall, who works in the nearby national park, has seen\u00a0 the impact that climate change has had on the village.\u00a0  \"Nowadays, if you dig a well, it's hard to get fresh water. Before, this [part of the village] was a river, but now the river and the ocean have become one because of the rising sea levels.\" Before he left, Babacar's livelihood, like that of most villagers, was fishing. Unused boats on the beaches serve as symbols of a defeated industry. Locals say there aren't enough fish anymore. Read more: \u00a0 Business and migration to shape Merkel's trip to West Africa\u00a0 Some blame it on rising temperatures that have driven stocks to cooler waters in the north, while others attribute it to large foreign commercial boats that fish, sometimes illegally, in local\u00a0waters. Fish has long been the staple protein in Senegal. The collapse of fish stocks in recent years, reportedly by as much as 80 percent\u00a0in some areas , has led to increased food insecurity. Away from the water, the desert is encroaching further into the village, leaving those who live off the land with little to grow beyond onions and carrots. In the villages around Gandiol, people living off agriculture harvest onions, one of the few things that can still grow in the arid soil. The desert is increasingly encroaching on previously fertile land. \"I want to come back but I don't know when. As there are no fish in the ocean, I'd have nothing to do here,\u201d\u00a0Mamadou Diakhate told DW\u00a0while visiting his wife and two children\u00a0back home. Like Babacar, he was once a fisherman here, but now lives in Spain, which struck a 2006 deal with Senegal,\u00a0allowing migrants to work legally.\u00a0Many other men\u00a0who\u00a0saw no option but to leave, went to different\u00a0African countries.\u00a0 Precious few choices Thiaroye sur le Mer, a suburban area on the outskirts of the capital Dakar, is another place where the fishing industry has collapsed. \"Our community depends on fishing but we cannot compete with big, well-equipped foreign boats,\" says Yayi Bayam Diouf, a woman with experience of the dangers migrants face when they leave Senegal. Her son died on a boat trying to reach Europe. Yayi Diouf established an organisation to provide training and microloans for women affected by the migration of family members. The women learn new skills such as making soap or preserved fruit. After his death, she established the Collective of Women for the Fight Against Illegal Migration in Senegal, which provides training and microloans for women affected adversely by the migration of family members. Those who take part can gain different skills, such as making soap or preserved fruit, thereby generating an income for their families. As well as working with women, Yayi Bayam Diouf is also trying to convince potential migrants to stay in their home country, by talking to them about what life is like for Senegalese migrants in Europe. \"I tell them the truth. Often as many as eight share one room, they have no documents, they do not speak the language,\" she says. Read more: \u00a0 Madagascar: No more fish? We'll farm seaweed instead She points out the alternatives to leaving:\u00a0\"With the money you need to get to Europe, you could establish a small business here in Senegal.\" Such alternatives can work for some, but the fact remains that more than two-thirds of the Senegalese population still depends on agriculture and fishing, both of which are affected by rising temperatures and erratic weather patterns. It's not a challenge restricted to Senegal, but rather part of a wider global trend. Recent findings by  researchers at\u00a0 the\u00a0University of British Columbia outline\u00a0how\u00a0climate change could impact\u00a0global fishing,\u00a0predicting that\u00a0millions around the world could lose their jobs and food source, and be forced to migrate if global temperatures exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius rise of the Paris climate agreement. Women in the surrounding villages collect clams to sell. Today clams can be found further in land than they did in the past because of rising sea levels. Senegal's next generation Sometimes Almata also joins women from local villages as they set off on small boats to look for clams, which rising sea levels have brought closer inland. She can sell them for around 3 euros a kilo.

The midday heat has become unbearable. Magat, who dropped out of school a few years ago to take care of the household and the younger children while their mother works, has gone to fetch water. Despite the uncertainty of the future, Almata hopes the next generation will still find opportunities. \"The work I do is very hard, I'm often very tired. I don't want my kids to work like this, I want them to go to school and be successful,\" says Almata as she lifts a bucket of 20 kilos of fish onto her head. Where the Ganges and Bramhaputra rivers converge at the Bay of Bengal, they form a vast fertile delta. Sediment brought down from the Himalayas means this has long been a region of agricultural plenty. But as climate change pushes up the sea level and storms become more frequent and more severe, its inhabitants and way of life are among the most threatened on the planet. As saltwater seeps into once-fertile land, farmers are giving up agriculture and looking for new ways to make a living. Some relocate to urban areas to take low-paid jobs in factories producing cheap clothing for the West. Others are turning to aquaculture to supply another European consumer market \u2014 prawns. But the impact of shrimp farming on the delta coast is hastening its destruction. Some families, though, are turning to a more traditional, and less harmful strategy to make the most of their changing environment. Aquatic plants and straw are woven together to create a floating platform on which crops are planted. Bangla Delta farmers have been doing this for hundreds of years. But with climate change, this ancient technology has become a cutting-edge solution. Women and men work together to build the rafts. This farmer in Pirojpun shows the delicately wrapped seedlings she's preparing to plant on her floating garden. Leafy vegetables, okra, gourd, eggplant, pumpkin and onions all thrive on the raft gardens. Out on the water, they are less vulnerable to pests and don't require chemical fertilizers. Each raft lasts around three months. Then, it's hauled ashore, broken down, and used to fertilize crops on land. These days, the garden rafts are built on a base of water hyacinth. A voracious invasive species from the Amazon, the water hyacinth is upsetting the balance of ecosystems in many parts of the world. But its resistance to salt water, buoyancy and sheer abundance make it the ideal material for floating farms. Hari Podo and his family lived on a hyacinth raft for two months when a giant flood hit in 1988. \"Humans to one side and domestic animals to the other,\" he recalls. \"We slept and cooked food on the floating plants.\" Such floods are becoming an ever-greater threat. \"Seasons have changed,\" Podo says. \"Nowadays rain is heavier than before.\" Other delta communities are working to reclaim ground lost to the waters. The village of Nazir Bazar was created by piling soil onto swampy ground and draining it with a system of canals to create both farmland and residential areas. A farmer in Nazir Bazar looks skyward for clues as to when the next downpour will come. His boat is loaded with bananas grown on reclaimed land. The canals that drain the village's farmland also provide a transport network, bringing produce to market and children to school. Nazir Bazar farmer Giassudin Saddar has seen his home transformed over the years, but is optimistic about the future and his community's ability to adapt. \"Whatever we face \u2014 rivers, canals, rain, floods \u2014 we have learned to live with a changing environment,\" he says.

{"id": null, "body": "     The past 30 years have brought flood, drought and hunger to Afghanistan. With the Taliban sweeping to power, many within and outside of the country wonder how to deal with looming climate disaster. Worsening climate change could increase conflict of scarce arable land and resources in Afghanistan Forty years of conflict have left many Afghans on the edge of survival \u2014 and highly susceptible\u00a0to the impacts of climate change. Not only is the landlocked country already becoming drier and drier,\u00a0but it's also just been thrown into more political uncertainty by the\u00a0 Taliban takeover . \u00a0\u00a0 Experts say it's a recipe for disaster. \"You have a country that is one of the most\u202fvulnerable\u202fto climate change and any implications as a result of that and without the needed\u202fcapacities, you're looking at a human catastrophe,\" said Basir Feda, head of the Afghanistan unit at the Berlin-based Berghof Foundation,\u202fan NGO that promotes peacebuilding. The arid\u00a0state\u202fhas seen a\u202fmean rise in temperature of\u202f 1.8 degrees\u202fCelsius\u202f(3.24\u202fFahrenheit) since the middle of the 20th\u202fcentury, compared to a global average of 0.82 C.\u202fDroughts, already more frequent, are likely to become an annual occurrence\u00a0by 2030. Drought is becoming more frequent in landlocked Afghanistan According to the United Nations, a severe drought caused more internal displacement between\u202f2017 and 2018 than conflict did. And\u202fnow the country is\u202fin the midst of\u202fanother prolonged dry period, which the UN's World Food\u202fProgramme has warned could leave millions of Afghans at risk of starvation. The agency said\u202fit\u202fneeds $200 million\u202f(\u20ac170 million)\u202fa year to continue working in Afghanistan \u2014 its staff members\u202fare allowed\u202fto\u202fcontinue humanitarian operations in the wake of the Taliban's takeover. Oli Brown, an associate fellow at London-based policy think tank Chatham House,\u202ftold DW that food must get to Afghanistan's mountainous areas before winter\u202fweather makes\u202fsome places unreachable. \"The big challenge in the short term is feeding people in Afghanistan,\" said Brown. Nearly half of the country's 30 million people lives\u202fbelow the poverty line\u202fand a third is dealing with severe food insecurity. \"Obviously, the ability of the international community to do that now is reliant on decisions that the Taliban government takes \u2014 are they going to create the conditions in which people can eat?\" An Afghan refugee washes her clothes at a camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs). Climate change is expected to increase the number of IDPs Creating those conditions will require the Taliban\u202fto address climate change\u202fin the\u202flong term,\u202faccording to Brown. \"If you look at some of the predictions for Afghanistan in the future, this (climate change) is going to be something\u202fthat will be a constraint ...\u202fA Taliban government is going to have to deal with it if they want to see a more peaceful and a more secure Afghanistan, which can feed its people,\" he said. Even under one of the UN's more optimistic scenarios for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Afghanistan\u00a0will likely continue to warm by at least a further 1.5\u202fdegrees Celsius\u202fby 2050. That level of warming would\u00a0further decrease the amount of snow available to feeds rivers, making water even scarcer . Frequent droughts have made life difficult for Afghan farmers While drought will be even likelier, so too will extreme rainfall over short periods, increasing the chances of deadly landslides in the mountainous country. And years of war\u00a0have robbed Afghanistan of the ability to\u00a0build\u00a0capacity to adapt and protect its population.\u00a0 \"War is development in reverse,\" said Brown. That means that 40 years of\u202fconflict\u202fhave,\u00a0for instance, also meant a chronic underinvestment in water infrastructure like dams and irrigation. Farmers used to rely on ancient irrigation systems known as \"karez,\" which avoided evaporation by transporting\u202fwater underground from the mountains. Maintained by\u202fvillages,\u202fsome are still\u202ffunctional,\u202fbut the vast majority were destroyed\u202for fell into disrepair during\u202fdecades of war. More than 80% of the population is involved in agriculture and because so many are reliant on\u00a0 rain-fed farming and livestock raising, they are particularly vulnerable to climate shocks, added Brown. That, in turn, makes\u202fpeople\u202fmore likely to fall into severe\u202fpoverty, which\u202fincreases\u202fthe likelihood of displacement,\u202faccording to Action Aid, an international NGO working on poverty. A large share of Afghanistan's population is affected by drought and that is set to worsen in the future due to climate change Afghanistan already has\u202fnearly 4 million internally displaced people . And a recent\u00a0Action Aid analysis on climate change and gender \u00a0found a further\u202f5 million could be forced to migrate due to climate disasters\u202fby 2050 even if governments around the world act to significantly cut emissions.\u00a0 Climate change\u202fsets the stage for increased conflict over ever-decreasing\u00a0 resources like land and water. Evidence suggests\u202fit's\u202fpushing\u202fmore farmers to ditch food crops\u202flike wheat in favor of drought-resistant poppies used in the opium trade. Afghanistan\u202fis the\u202fworld's biggest producer in the opium industry, worth between\u202f$4.1 billion and $6.6 billion in 2017. Revenues from the trade are used to finance the Taliban and other armed groups.\u00a0 \"The whole question is how do you deal with poverty\u202fwhich comes as a result of climate\u202fchange?\" said\u202fBasir Feda of the Berghof Foundation.\u202f\"There's a direct link that exists between conflict and poverty. And climate change can really function as a catalyst there \u2014 and a pretty significant one at that.\" Farmers are turning to growing opium poppies as water dries up Abdul Qahar Balkhi, a member of the Taliban's Cultural Commission,\u202ftold US magazine Newsweek it was seeking global recognition of what it is calling an Islamic Emirate, and said climate change is a challenge\u202fthat can only be overcome with the collective efforts of all.\u202f Thus far only a few countries are willing to engage with the Taliban. The question for the international community is how much they should engage with the group.\u00a0 \"They will not be able to run the country without assistance, they must know this,\" said Jost\u202fPachaly, who heads the Asia division at the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation,\u202fa policy reform think tank based in Germany. \"It's a very critical question for the international community: how to deal with the situation \u2014 not to support the Taliban but also not\u202flet the Afghan people suffer \u2026 This is a humanitarian disaster.\" Women are often hit hardest by climate change impacts Women, whose rights are already being curbed under Taliban rule, will likely face an even more uncertain future in the context of climate change.\u00a0Internationally women are hardest hit by the impacts of global heating , as they\u202fare often responsible for collecting water and\u202fproviding meals. In Afghanistan,\u202fparticularly\u202fin rural parts of the country,\u202fwomen are further constrained,\u202fbecause they are expected to confine their\u202fsocial and economic\u202flives to the home, or as close to it as possible and are totally financially dependent on\u202fmen to work and\u00a0support their families, says Basir Feda. \"This puts women in a far more vulnerable situation, because not only do they\u202fplay an important role in putting food on the table,\u202fthey\u202falso\u202fdo\u202fit in an environment where their capabilities are severely limited.\" While\u202forganizations\u202flike the World Bank have\u202fsuspended\u202faid to the country as they wait to see what the Taliban does, international aid and humanitarian organizations want to continue working in there. Feda says it is on the \"Taliban's shoulders\" to keeps its promises and create an inclusive government\u202facceptable\u202fto all Afghans\u202fso the country can work towards peace and create climate\u202fresiliency.\u202f\"I will never believe that all is lost in Afghanistan.\" While scientists warn of their negative impact on biodiversity, the autonomous Kurdistan Region is building multiple dams to respond to water insecurity.

{"id": null, "body": "     World leaders will fail to honor their climate pledges unless they make \"immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions\" to greenhouse gas emissions, a long-awaited assessment finds. Climate change has made heat waves hotter and more frequent Carbon pollution has risen to such extremes that a key threshold in the fight to stop climate change \u2014 limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century \u2014 will be crossed within the next 15 years. That is one of the key findings from a landmark report approved by delegates from 195 countries and published Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The analysis, which comes amid record-breaking heat and rains that have rocked rich and poor countries alike, draws on more than 14,000 peer-reviewed studies to assess the physical science of climate change. It paints a sober picture of a planet warped beyond recognition by members of a single species in the space of just a few hundred years. \"This report is a reality check,\" said Val\u00e9rie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC \u00a0working group that prepared it. Also the world's richest countries are suffering from worsening weather extremes By burning fossil fuels and releasing gases that heat the Earth like a greenhouse, people have warmed the planet by about 1.1 C. Across the world, the report shows, this has made heat waves and heavy rains stronger and more common. The share of tropical cyclones with high wind speeds has risen. In many regions, droughts are drier and last longer. Since the fifth major IPCC assessment of the physical science in 2013, scientists have also grown more certain that climate change has made individual fires, floods and storms stronger. There is a simple solution to prevent weather getting worse \u2014 to stop burning fossil fuels \u2014 but governments, businesses and individual people are failing to do so fast enough.\u00a0 \"When I look at the results we found on climate extremes, then I'd say we are in a climate crisis,\" said Sonia Seneviratne, a scientist at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich in Switzerland, and co-author of the report. \"We really have a very big problem.\" Greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere as people burn fossil fuels In 2015, world leaders pledged to limit warming by the end of the century to well below 2 C \u2014 ideally 1.5 C \u2014 in a global effort to avoid escalating catastrophes. But they are instead pursuing policies that put the planet on track for 3 C, according to German-based research group Climate Action Tracker. While the 1.5 C target will be broached within a couple of decades, temperatures could be brought back below it by the end of the century under the report's most ambitious scenario for cutting pollution. As well as rapidly decarbonizing the global economy, it would involve sucking enormous amounts of CO2 out of the atmosphere. But the technology to do so is expensive, and there is little evidence to suggest it could work at the scales needed. \"It's much easier to avoid emissions now rather than blowing past our carbon budget and having to take a lot of emissions out of the atmosphere again,\" said Malte Meinshausen, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germny and co-author of the report. \"That price tag is higher than a lot of the low-hanging fruit that we have today.\" Across the globe, extreme rains will grow 7% heavier for each degree Celsius of global warming. More tropical cyclones will be classed in the highest categories 4 and 5. Asian monsoon rains will fall harder and at different times. \"With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger,\" the authors wrote. Heavy rains that used to hit once a decade have already grown 30% more likely. But with a further 3 C of warming, they will strike two or even three times per decade, and unleash a third more water when they do fall. Droughts that used to occur once every 10 years will leave soil barren and infertile four times per decade instead. Heat waves \u2014 already 2.8 times more likely and 1 C hotter than before the industrial revolution \u2014 will be 9.4 times more likely and 5 C hotter. And the greater the warming, the greater the risk of the climate warping out of step in terms of\u00a0temperature rise. The report projects heat waves that used to scorch the land once every 50 years will, in a world with 4 C of global warming, instead strike 39 times over the same time period instead. \"The report clearly sets out the evidence of the urgency of action,\" said Veronika Eyring, an Earth systems scientist at the German Aerospace Center and another co-author of the report. Some of the changes to the climate will spur further warming. Natural carbon sinks in the ocean and on land become less effective as the planet heats. Higher temperatures will thaw even more permafrost \u2014 releasing vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere \u2014 while melting snow and ice cover that reflects heat away from the planet. The Arctic is likely to be practically free of sea ice in September at least once before 2050. Still, scientists say permafrost thaw, the most worrying of these, is not enough to lead to runaway warming\u00a0within a dramatic,\u00a0self-reinforcing acceleration of climate change. But that would make the fight to stabilize the climate harder. Higher levels of atmospheric pollution mean stronger feedback loops that become harder to predict. Some processes have also started that cannot be stopped. Sea levels are expected to rise more than 0.5 meter (1 foot 8 inches) this century. This has already started to make coastal floods stronger and more likely, and will continue to do so in the future. Scientists say that uncertainties in how ice sheets respond to warming mean that far worse extremes \u2013 2 meters by 2100 and 5 meters by 2150 under a \"very high\" emissions scenario \u2013 can't be ruled out. Every bit of climate protection helps, said Douglas Maraun, a scientist at the Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change in Austria and also a co-author of the report. \"Every degree \u2013 or 10th of a degree \u2013 of warming that is avoided reduces the risk of extreme events. Perhaps that helps us not to bury our heads in the sand.\" Sea levels will keep rising long after greenhouse gas emissions stop The biggest sources of the greenhouse gas emissions changing the climate are coal, oil and gas. But the report's 43-page summary for policymakers, a document prepared first by scientists and then approved line-by-line by government delegates, does not contain the words \" fossil fuels .\" IPCC authors are not allowed to comment on the approval meeting itself, which is confidential, but \"in the material that the scientists write, absolutely, fossil fuels get mentioned,\" said climate scientist Meinshausen. But \"even while we lose some words, it is a remarkable achievement to have in the end the agreement from all governments. Not a single government in the world can now turn around and say they don't believe what the IPCC wrote.\" \"The science stands for itself and was not watered down in the process,\" added Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford and co-author of the report. The IPCC report is the first installment of three and comes ahead of the COP26 climate summit in the United Kingdom in November. World leaders will discuss solutions like promising to stop\u00a0burning coal by 2030 and fulfilling a pledge made by rich countries to pay poorer ones $100 billion a year to adapt to climate change by 2020. They have\u00a0so far\u00a0failed to do so. A wildfire that burned through at least 7,780 hectares (30 square miles) in about a week and devastated forests in southern Spain was brought under control thanks to steady rains. The downpour helped the firefighters, who were backed by some 50 aircrafts. The blaze was one of the most difficult to combat in recent times in Spain. Some 2,600 people were forced to flee their homes. Unprecedented flooding \u2014 caused by two months' worth of rainfall in two days \u2014 has resulted in devastating damage in central Europe, leaving at least 226 people dead in Germany and Belgium. Narrow valley streams swelled into raging floods in the space of hours, wiping out centuries-old communities. Rebuilding the ruined homes, businesses and infrastructure is expected to cost billions of euros. While half of Europe is drowning, elsewhere areas are going up in flames: Large fires raged, particularly in Greece, Italy and Turkey. They have caused unforeseeable monetary damage, while thousands of people in Europe have lost their homes and their belongings. In addition to deadly wildfires, Italy also battled record heat temperatures, with the Italian Health Ministry issuing the maximum possible heat warning level for many cities. On the island of Sicily, 48.8 degrees Celsius (almost 120 degrees Fahrenheit) was measured on August 11 \u2014 a new European heat record. The heat could make existing fires worse, or lead to new ones. Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire continues smoldering in California. It's California's largest fire on record, and among the most destructive in the state's history \u2014 it wiped the town of Greenville off the map. Although it's about 60% contained, the fire continues to burn two months in. Meanwhile, hot and dry conditions continue in the region, spreading fears of more fire. Earlier this summer, record floods also hit parts of India and central China, overwhelming dams and drains and flooding streets. The downpours have been particularly heavy, even for the rainy season. Scientists have predicted that climate change will lead to more frequent and intense rainfall \u2014 warmer air holds more water, creating more rain. As nations flood in northern Europe, Mediterranean countries like Greece were in the grip of several heat waves. In the first week of July, temperatures soared to 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit). Tourism hot spots like the Acropolis were forced to shut during the day, while the extreme heat also sparked forest fires outside Thessaloniki, which helicopters tried to douse. \"It is an unprecedented reality in Sardinia\u2019s history,\" said Sardinia's Governor Christian Salinas of the ongoing wildfires that have scorched the historic central western area of Montiferru. \"So far, 20,000 hectares of forest that represent centuries of environmental history of our island have gone up in ashes.\" Around 1,500 people were evacuated from the island by the end of July. Intense heat is becoming more common, as seen in late June in the US states of Washington and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Scorching temperatures under a \"heat dome,\" hot air trapped for days by high pressure fronts, caused hundreds of heat-related deaths. The village of Lytton recorded a high of 49.6 Celsius (121 Fahrenheit) \u2014 and burned to the ground the next day. Heat and drought are fueling one of the most intense wildfire seasons in the West Coast and Pacific Northwest regions. Oregon's Bootleg Fire, which burned an area the size of Los Angeles in just two weeks, was so big it created its own weather and sent smoke all the way to New York City. A recent study said the weather conditions would have been \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. To the south, central Brazil is suffering its worst drought 100 years, increasing the risk of fires and further deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Researchers recently reported that a large swath of the southeastern Amazon has flipped from absorbing to emitting planet-warming CO2 emissions, pushing the rainforest closer to a \"tipping point.\" After years of unrelenting drought, more than 1.14 million people in Madagascar are food-insecure, with some now forced to eat raw cactus, wild leaves and roots, and locusts in famine-like conditions. With the absence of natural disaster, crop failure or political conflict, the dire situation in the African nation is said to be first famine in modern history caused solely by climate change. The number of people fleeing conflict and natural disasters hit a 10-year high in 2020, with a record 55 million people relocating within their own country. That's in addition to some 26 million people who fled across borders. A joint report released by refugee monitors in May found that three-quarters of the internally displaced were victims of extreme weather \u2014 and that number is likely to grow.

{"id": null, "body": "     Even the world's largest CO2 emitters are suffering the effects of climate change. So what's stopping countries like Germany, India, Saudi Arabia, the US and China from changing tack and going green? A drastic reduction in emissions is needed to avert catastrophic global warming. And it's needed fast, say climate scientists.\u00a0Global greenhouse gas emissions must fall by 7.6% each year over the next decade\u00a0to limit rising temperatures to the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0threshold outlined in the Paris Agreement, a UN Environment Program report warns. Read more: \u00a0 CO2 emissions gap: UN report warns of 'collective failure to act' Reducing emissions must be a global effort. But some nations emit far more CO2 than others. From industry to infrastructure, resources to development, and population to politics, there are different reasons for these countries' high carbon emissions. But why is it so hard to cut back on carbon and make progress on climate protection? Germany: Cars and coal A decade ago, Germany's plan to move to\u00a0renewable energy positioned the country as a pioneer in the fight against climate change. But its climate protection efforts have stalled, and Germany is still a major contributor\u00a0to global CO2 emissions. Read more: COP 25: When it comes to climate protection, Germany still has a lot to do\u00a0 Fossil fuels make up 80%\u00a0of Germany's primary energy consumption, according to government data. Some 22%\u00a0of that comes from coal. The country relies on black coal and lignite to maintain a steady energy supply alongside fluctuating\u00a0renewables. The industrial and transport sectors are also contributors to Germany's high CO2 output. The nation is one of the world's largest car exporters, and the strong car industry lobby has in the past led Germany to pursue less ambitious targets when it comes to reducing emissions. Under pressure from an increasingly climate-conscious electorate, the German government has promised to shut down all coal-powered plants by 2038 . It has also pledged to raise fuel prices in an attempt to reduce transport emissions. But with Germany likely to miss its CO2 reduction targets for 2020, the government's latest climate policies have been slammed as too little, too late. More than half of Germans surveyed by public broadcaster ZDF said the measures did not go far enough. USA: Political issues The power and transportation sectors are the two largest contributors to CO2 emissions in the US, according to figures from the country's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). More than 80%\u00a0of US energy consumption comes from fossil fuels. While the US is the second-largest CO2 emitter globally, it's also the country where climate change denial has most taken root. Six%\u00a0of the population believes the climate is not changing \u2014\u00a0the highest figure among 28 countries surveyed in a recent YouGov poll. Another 9%\u00a0of Americans believe the climate is changing, but that human activity is not responsible. US President Donald Trump has himself denounced climate change as a hoax and\u00a0 started the official process of pulling the country out of the 2015 Paris Agreement , a global pact aimed at limiting global temperature rise. The country was recently ranked worst in the world for climate protection efforts. \u00a0\"Climate policy there is going backwards,\"\u00a0said Niklas H\u00f6hne, one of the authors of the Global Climate Protection Index report, published by environmental groups Germanwatch and the NewClimate Institute. Saudi Arabia: An oil-dependent economy The Gulf state is the world's largest oil exporter and its economy relies heavily on the oil industry. Ambitious pledges to diversify by investing in renewables have resulted in little progress. The country also has high per capita emissions at 16.3 tons annually compared to the global average of around 4.8 tons per person per year. This is partly due to people needing to cool their homes. The desert country faces extreme temperatures, water shortages and increasing desertification. A recent YouGov poll found that the majority of Saudis believe climate change would affect their lives. Of those surveyed, 41%\u00a0believed the issue would have \"a great deal of impact.\" For years, critics have blamed Saudi Arabia not only for its high contributions to climate change\u00a0but for blocking attempts to tackle it. Speaking at the current climate summit in Madrid, Jennifer Morgan, executive director at Greenpeace International, accused the Saudi government \u2014 along with others like Brazil \u2014 of trying to weaken UN agreements aimed at slowing global warming. India: Growth and development India is the third-largest carbon emitter globally. But its CO2 output is far lower than both China and the US. And when India's huge population is taken into account, the picture looks different again.\u00a0Its emissions per capita are actually less than half the global average. That's partly because a large proportion of the population lives in poverty \u2014 more than a quarter, according to the UN's latest human development report. India has been hit by deadly flooding as well as drought in 2019 However, the country is developing fast. Its energy demands are rising , as are its emissions. The country meets its energy needs mainly through coal. Fossil fuels account for almost three-quarters of India's total energy consumption, UN figures show. The government has promised to change that, saying India aims to generate 40%\u00a0of its energy\u00a0from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. Read more: \u00a0 COP25: Developing past fossil fuels in India But investors are put off by the initial high financial outlay required for renewable energy infrastructure, despite the long-term savings. Many argue investment in green energy projects should also come from industrialized nations to boost sustainable development. Until energy produced by renewable sources like wind and solar can be stored cheaply and efficiently, the country will still need to rely on coal power. China: Embedded emissions China is the largest carbon emitter globally. But it also has the world's largest population. China's annual per capita emissions are growing, and at 6.4 tons they are already higher than the 4.8-ton global average. But this figure pales in comparison to the per capita emissions of other big emitters by nation, like the US (15 tons) and Saudi Arabia (16.3 tons). Air pollution leaves Chinese cities at times shrouded in smog As the world's top manufacturing nation and the largest exporter of goods, embedded emissions \u2014 CO2 embedded in exported goods \u2014 are a big issue for China. Because CO2 emissions are generally measured by the amount a country directly emits, nations can reduce their emissions by outsourcing carbon-emitting production abroad\u00a0to places like China. However, China also benefits from this means of emissions measuring. While it has cut the share of coal in its own energy mix, it invests heavily in coal-fired power projects around the world. But China has made ambitious climate promises, aiming to bring emissions to a peak by \"around 2030\"\u00a0and further reduce its use of fossil fuels in the next decade. Progress in reducing air pollution also offers hope that the leading CO2 contributor could achieve a shift towards climate protection in future.\u00a0 Per capita emissions and fossil fuel statistics taken from this 2019 UN data \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Why are high emission countries lagging on climate protection?", "article_name": "why-are-high-emission-countries-lagging-on-climate-protection", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/why-are-high-emission-countries-lagging-on-climate-protection/a-51644769", "date_published": "2019-12-12 00:00:00", "article_length": 7439, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:10.896436"}
{"id": null, "body": "     The burning of fossil fuels like coal and gas supercharged the heat wave that has scorched India and Pakistan in recent weeks, two separate attribution studies have found. Construction workers are among the most vulnerable to deadly heat waves Climate change has strengthened a heat wave that\u00a0for several weeks has been scorching the homes of more than 1 billion people. The blistering heat \u2014 reported to have killed at least 90 people across India and Pakistan \u2014 would have been 1 degree Celsius cooler and 30 times less likely if people hadn't warmed the planet, according to a study published Monday by scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA), an international group of climate scientists. Last week, an estimate from the UK Meteorological Office said human influence had increased the likelihood of extreme heat a hundredfold. The analyses underscore the extent to which carbon pollution is already wreaking havoc on society. The heat has sparked forest fires in India, melted glaciers that triggered flash floods in Pakistan\u00a0and caused blackouts in both countries that have made it even harder for citizens who can afford air conditioning to stay safe. Crop yields have suffered at a time when global hunger is creeping up and wheat supplies\u00a0have been rocked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine . \"With future global warming, of course, heat waves like this will become more common and hotter,\" said Krishna Achutarao, an atmospheric scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and co-author of the WWA study. Experts have warned that\u00a0 the effect on crops is particularly worrying. By last year, a series of crises \u2014 conflict, climate, COVID and\u00a0economy \u2014 had already \"undermined decades of progress\" toward\u00a0food security, according to a report published last Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization , a United Nations agency that deals with weather. The number of undernourished people had plateaued in the 2010s after having fallen for decades, but is estimated to have risen sharply in 2020. In addition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has now disrupted\u00a0grain exports from two of the world's biggest wheat exporters. Earlier this month, India, the second-largest wheat producer after China, banned exports after heat scorched farms and ravaged crops . An estimated 10% to 30% of its wheat was hit at a time when crops were supposed to ripen the most, said Aditi Kapoor, a risk management expert at the International Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center and co-author of the WWA study. \"[First] the farmers are affected, and then when the prices go up, it's the poor people buying the food who are affected,\" she said. India's ban of wheat exports could worsen food security around the world When storms and heat waves strike, WWA scientists across the world work at breakneck speeds to model the chance of extreme weather occurring in today's climate. They then compare that data with that of an imaginary world without human influence. The results are published as pre-print studies before they have undergone peer-review, so policymakers and the public can understand the role climate change played while it's still fresh in their minds. For most weather extremes, the guiding question is whether global warming played a role or not. But with heat waves \u2014 all of which have already been made hotter and more likely by climate change \u2014 the question is simply by how much. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century, humanity has released vast quantities of sunlight-trapping gases that act like a greenhouse around the Earth. This has raised average temperatures, which brings with it a dramatic intensification of hot extremes. The biggest source of greenhouse gas pollution is burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, as well as razing forests and farming animals that belch methane. Getting enough water has become a greater struggle for residents, particularly in informal settlements A study published in the journal Energy Research & Social Science last year found 20 companies were responsible for more than a third of the\u00a0emissions from fossil fuels and cement production that heated the planet between 1965 and 2018, including the pollution from burning fuels they sold to third parties. The four biggest investor-owned fossil fuel companies \u2014 Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP\u00a0and Shell \u2014 were responsible for 11% of the emissions.\u00a0 The companies did not immediately respond to a DW request for comment. People working outdoors during the daytime \u2014 like farmers and builders \u2014 are the most vulnerable to heat waves, along with elderly people and those with underlying health problems. In 2010, a heat wave in India killed 1,344 people in the western city of Ahmedabad alone. In 2015, a heat wave in Pakistan killed more than 1,000 in the capital, Islamabad. Since the current heat wave began, an estimated 90 people have died across the two countries, according to WWA. But that figure is likely an undercount. Doctors can calculate the rise in excess mortality months after a disaster, but official statistics rarely capture the full extent of heat-related deaths. Heat waves can have knock-on effects across the global climate. They can melt glaciers, leading to flash floods like the ones that tore Pakistan and washed away bridges in May. Hotter air also holds more moisture, resulting in heavier rainfall\u00a0\u2014\u00a0though other climatic factors can work in the other direction. In the last week, northern Indian states like Assam and Arunachal Pradesh were struck by twin catastrophes of heavy rain and heat. People have sought refuge in the shade to escape the stifling, and in some cases life-threatening, heat To save lives during heat waves, governments can warn residents ahead of the danger, coordinate health care workers to protect the most vulnerable groups and set up cooling centers to provide people with shade and water. In the last five\u00a0years, 130 cities in India have rolled out heat action plans, according to the WWA. \"Definitely, there's a need to scale it up much more,\" said Kapoorof the International Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center. Still, such solutions cannot help indefinitely. Many of those working on farms or building sites cannot afford to stay at home, where it may be cooler. A recent report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u00a0summarizing the academic literature on the effects of climate change found that \"hard limits to adaptation\" have already been reached in some places. More limits will be met as the planet heats up. People have already\u00a0heated the planet by about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the start of the Industrial Revolution. World leaders signed an agreement in 2015 to try to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Instead, most are pursuing policies that are set to nearly double that upper limit. If global warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, the WWA report found, a heat wave such as the recent one to hit India and Pakistan would become between two\u00a0and 20 times more likely than it is today \u2014 and an extra 0.5 to 1.5 Celsius\u00a0hotter. \"The human body can only get rid of heat up to a certain point,\" said Achutarao. India is currently experiencing an exceptional heat wave. Rajgarh, a city of 1.5 million people in central India topped out at 46.5 degrees C (116 degrees F) while thermometers in nine other cities also climbed above the 45 degree mark. No wonder that anything to fight the heat is an easy sell on the streets of New Delhi. The extremely high temperatures have even ignited a huge garbage dump in India's capital New Delhi. Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College in London, notes that such heat waves used to occur about once every 50 years before man-made climate change. Now they occur about once every four years. According to a 2021 report in The Lancet, India's vulnerability to extreme heat increased by 15% from 1990 to 2019. It is among the top five countries where vulnerable people, such as the elderly and the poor, are most exposed to the dangers of heat waves. Along with Brazil, India has the highest heat-related mortality in the world. Medical experts are seeing an increased incidence of heat-related illnesses and believe that the high temperatures are a greater threat than an expected fourth wave of COVID-19. But the crisis also brings out solidarity in people. This Calcutta resident is distributing cool water to passersby. Indian farmers are worried about their harvest \u2014 not so much because of the current record temperatures but because this March was overall the hottest March since temperature records began in 1901. Wheat grains usually ripen around that month and that's when they are particularly sensitive to heat. Baldev Singh from Sangrur saw his crop shrink before his eyes as winter did not turn into a cool spring as usual but into unrelenting summer heat. The farmer from Punjab \u2014 the state known as India's breadbasket \u2014 lost about a fifth of his yield. Other farmers were hit even harder. India, the world's second largest producer of wheat, traditionally exports little of it. Faced with shortages due to the Ukraine war, India planned to tap new markets and benefit from increased world prices. But going ahead with this would now create \"a lot of pressure on the domestic availability of wheat,\" says Devinder Sharma, a Chandigarh-based agricultural expert.

{"id": null, "body": "     A new report by the World Economic Forum says global risk perceptions are shifting. While in previous years economic problems were deemed the biggest threats to mankind, fears of a climate breakdown are now dominating. In its 15th Global Risks Report published on Wednesday, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has said that for the first time in the report's history all of the \"top long-term risks by likelihood\" are environmental. While in the previous decade economic and financial crises were seen as most dangerous, the report has found that risk perceptions have shifted to extreme weather, environmental disasters, biodiversity loss, natural catastrophes and failure to mitigate climate change. \"Climate change is a very real and serious threat to society,\" said Alison Martin, a senior member of Zurich Insurance Group, who helped compile the publication, alongside consultancy Marsh & McLennan and a number of renowned universities from across the world. \"Extreme weather events such as heat waves and flooding are becoming more commonplace and severe, leaving communities to deal with often devastating humanitarian and economic costs,\" she added. WEF is an international organization focusing on cooperation between the public and private sectors, and brings together business leaders, government policymakers and representatives of civil society to foster global deliberations on burning issues.

Among the short-term risks facing mankind already in 2020, three out of four respondents to the survey cited economic confrontations, political polarization, extreme heat waves, destruction of natural resource ecosystems and cyberattacks as the most pressing ones. Multilateral systems falling apart WEF describes the world we live in as rife with \"geopolitical and geoeconomic uncertainty.\" Powerful economic, demographic and technological forces are shaping a new balance of power, in which states are increasingly viewing opportunities and challenges through \"unilateral lenses.\" As a result, alliance structures and multilateral systems are threatening to collapse under the pressure of \"nationalist postures in pursuit of individual agendas and economic decoupling.\" WEF President Borge Brende noted in the report that renewing the architecture of multilateral political and economic systems was \"this generation's defining task.\" \"It will be a monumental undertaking, but an indispensable one. The Global Risks Report demonstrates how high the stakes are,\" he wrote, adding that hopes for the global system to simply \"snap back\" was running the risk of missing \"crucial windows\" to address pressing problems. Economic stability and social cohesion Amid fraying global consensus about politics and economics, the WEF fears that 2020 will be marked by heightened economic confrontations and domestic political polarization, the report says. In addition, weakening economic growth and rising financial inequality are increasing the risk of economic stagnation, while at the same time governments' space to stimulate economies with monetary and fiscal policy is narrowing. Amid this darkening economic outlook, people's discontent with their political leaders is set to harden, leading to more public protests that are potentially weakening the ability of governments to take decisive action should a downturn occur. But without economic and social stability , countries could lack the \"financial resources, political capital or social support needed to confront key global risks.\" Chile has become the poster child of neoliberal economic policy. But while the economy grew strongly, filling the pockets of the rich, ordinary people didn't benefit from the boom and are venting their anger in street protests Climate threats and biodiversity loss As the last five years have already been the warmest on record, climate change is expected to strike harder in the coming years, making weather-related disasters more intense and more frequent. \"The near-term impacts of climate change add up to a planetary emergency that will include loss of life, social and geopolitical tensions and negative economic impacts,\" the report says, adding that failure of climate change mitigation and adaption is the No. 1 risk by impact and number two by likelihood over the next 10 years. With it comes the loss of biodiversity \u2014 ranked as the second most impactful and third most likely risk for the next decade \u2014 which has critical implications for humanity due to the likely collapse of food and health systems and disruptions of entire supply chains. Digital fragmentation and health care While digital technology is bringing tremendous economic and societal benefits to much of the global population, the respondents to the WEF survey believe that unequal access to the internet, the lack of a global technology governance framework and cyberinsecurity are all posing significant risk. This will \"prevent the full potential of next generation technologies from being realized,\" the report concludes. In the field of public health care, threats to existing systems are mainly seen coming from \"changing societal, environmental, demographic and technological patterns\" that could undo the dramatic gains in wellness and prosperity. Here, the report identifies the rise in, for example, cardiovascular diseases and mental illness, as well as the increasing costs from chronic diseases as threats to public health systems worldwide. \"As existing health risks resurge and new ones emerge, humanity's past successes in overcoming health challenges are no guarantee of future results,\" the report says. WEF concludes its 2020 risks assessment by saying that \"as the window of opportunity is closing, coordinated, multistakeholder action is needed quickly to mitigate against the worst outcomes.\" \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "WEF Risks Report ranks climate change as biggest global threat", "article_name": "wef-risks-report-ranks-climate-change-as-biggest-global-threat", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/wef-risks-report-ranks-climate-change-as-biggest-global-threat/a-51997420", "date_published": "2020-01-15 00:00:00", "article_length": 6183, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:13.081647"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Floods, heat and disease: The health impacts of climate change are already being felt. Making the connection between the planet's health and our own could drive climate action, say experts. Cutting fossil fuel use and switching to electric vehicles would greatly benefit human health Countries are slowly acknowledging the link between climate change and human health , but funding is still lacking\u00a0to help poorer nations deal with the growing health impacts of global heating, from malnutrition to the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, experts say. \"Health has been the great absentee and now it is the great present,\" Maria Neira, director of\u00a0the World Health Organization's environment, climate change and health program, told DW. \"People keep saying we have to save the planet, but we have to save ourselves. The planet is greater than we are, it will survive us.\" Climate change is expected to cause some 250,000 additional deaths a year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone, the WHO has warned. Even if countries manage to find a way to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), there will be serious consequences for\u00a0the health of billions of people worldwide. And developing countries that lack good health care infrastructure , as well as the money to invest in adaption measures to cope with the additional burden of climate-related health issues, will bear the brunt. \"Funds must be injected there. Health centers in poorer countries that are often already under extreme pressure\u00a0are now dealing with more diseases brought about by\u00a0restricted access to water and food production resulting from global warming,\" Neira added.\u00a0 Climate change is already harming health around the world. For instance, health-related mortality of those aged over 65 reached a record high of an estimated 345,000 deaths in 2019, according to the 2021 Lancet Countdown on health and climate change . But there are indirect impacts too. Wetter, warmer weather facilitates the spread of bacteria that cause diseases such as cholera. These are also ideal breeding conditions for\u00a0 mosquitoes that carry malaria and dengue fever. As the world warms, disease-carrying insects will spread into new regions. \"There are regions in Asia where 35% of the population will be at risk of dengue,\" Neira said. \"These are figures that we must think about very carefully because it is like going back 20 or 30 years.\" More people will be at risk of disease in a warmer world, like this dengue fever outbreak in New Delhi in October Some impacts are even more hidden. In a country like Malawi, women make up some 85% of the agricultural workforce. Increased drought means they have to travel longer distances to feed their families and collect water, said Dominic Amon Nyasulu of the Malawi National Youth Climate Change Network. Nyasulu, the\u00a0group's national coordinator,\u00a0told DW that this\u00a0can expose them to \"many health-related problems, such as gender-based violence of all kinds.\"\u00a0 And as families become less able to take care of their children, leading to an increase in child marriage, he said\u00a0girls are exposed to unwanted relationships. \"That puts them at risk of contracting sex-related transmissions such as HIV and AIDS.\" \u00a0 At COP26, a group of around 50 countries, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia and the Netherlands committed to developing climate-resilient health systems to deal with those impacts. Such measures include strengthening the health care workforce and constructing hospitals and other infrastructure to deal with flooding. A growing number of countries are also including health considerations, from the co-benefits of cutting emissions to prioritizing health care system adaptations, in the national climate plans they're required to establish under the Paris Agreement, according to the\u00a0 WHO's health and climate change global survey report . Health care adaptations can also cover creating efficient ways for people to cool themselves\u00a0in cities, to avoid illness and death linked to extreme heat, and building water supply and sanitation systems that ensure drinking water doesn't become contaminated during floods. Creating more green spaces in cities helps keep them cool and improves air quality But the survey\u00a0found countries cited a lack of funding as a barrier to implementing their climate and health plans. Another\u00a0WHO analysis said just 0.5% of multilateral climate finance \u00a0 goes to health projects. Meanwhile,\u00a0 $11 million (\u20ac9.5 million) per minute goes to fossil fuel subsidies, Nicole de Paula, founder and executive director of Women Leaders for Planetary Health, told DW. \"We need to absolutely align national budgets with the priorities of the Paris Agreement,\" said de Paula. This year, for the first time ever at a UN climate conference, the WHO has a pavilion\u00a0where it's running a full two-week program aimed at bringing attention to the interplay between planetary and human health.\u00a0 Drawing the connections between how climate action has benefits for human health could hasten the change needed to curb global warming, said the WHO's Neira. \"I would even say it will be the one that will bring the change in the ambition and speed we need to fight climate change. Why? Because nothing motivates more than protecting health,\" Neira said. For instance, air pollution causes some 7 million premature deaths a year, according to the WHO. But climate action to cut fossil fuel use\u00a0would both slow global warming and improve air quality \u2014 saving lives and improving the health of those suffering from diseases such as asthma. \u00a0\u00a0 Human health and a healthy environment are one and the same, said Nicole de Paula, who is part of the growing \"planetary health\" movement, which sees the two as inextricably linked. \"We're not only talking about isolated polar bears,\" said de Paula. \"Human health cannot be protected without the most basic sources of life functioning well: that is a healthy climate, healthy soils, healthy forests.\" Cutting greenhouse gas emissions would not only slow global heating, it would also ensure our food remains nutritious. When plants absorb excess CO2, they produce less protein and fewer nutrients like zinc and iron. Deficiencies in those nutrients can result in many health problems, especially in children. If CO2 keeps rising, hundreds of millions more people will face chronic undernutrition. Outdoor air pollution causes around 4.2 million deaths a year, due to illness like heart disease and lung cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Burning fossil fuels to power vehicles, homes and industry as well as agriculture and waste incineration is behind much of that pollution. Switching away from climate-killing fuels to green energy would benefit human and planetary health. Plant and animal species are declining at an unprecedented rate. But these species and the ecosystems in which they live provide the services central to all life on Earth, including our own. They deliver food, energy, clean air and water, and provide the basis for many medicines and livelihoods. Protecting the integrity of ecosystems ensures the health of communities around the world. More than half the world's population lives in urban areas, and that figure is rising. Those living in cities are already experiencing air pollution from road traffic and industry. Creating a greener transport network that includes trains, bikes and plenty of room for pedestrians would improve air quality, reduce noise pollution and traffic accidents as well as encourage a more active lifestyle. Driving biodiversity loss is the transformation of habitat for industrial or agricultural use, such as the destruction of forests in Borneo for palm oil plantations. Changing land use could be pushing the emergence and spread of infectious disease, while runoff from agriculture and industry pollutes water and air. Promoting protected areas and sustainable land use would help on both scores. Global warming is making extreme weather, such as super storms, wildfires, flooding and serious drought, more likely. According to the WHO, weather-related disasters cause more than 60,000 deaths a year, mainly in developing countries. Adaptation measures and limiting warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels would lessen the health impacts and future death tolls. Destruction wrought by extreme weather can cause post-traumatic stress in those caught up in the events, particularly if people are forced to flee their homes and cannot return for some time. Climate and environmental breakdown are thought to be affecting the mental well-being of people around the world. Protecting nature and combating climate change would reduce the toll on mental health. Author: Jennifer Collins \n Developing countries face a massive funding shortfall in preparing for inevitable climate change. But governments could use COVID-19 recovery funds to create long-term sustainable climate adaptation measures. \u00a0 As the climate changes, so do the risks to our health.

{"id": null, "body": "     Kuwait, a wealthy oil producer, is among the world's hottest countries. But the climate crisis is largely ignored.\u00a0 Sweltering heat pushes everyone to the brink - and Kuwait is feeling the effects of global warming to the extreme When it comes to the climate crisis, Kuwait is a land of superlatives. The tiny, wealthy nation sandwiched between Iraq and Saudi Arabia is among the world's top oil producers and has one of the highest emissions per capita. \u00a0 In 2020, the country emitted more than 20 tons of CO2, Our World in Data reported , while the Democratic Republic of Congo only recorded 0.03 tons.\u00a0 But Kuwait is also feeling the effects of global warming to the extreme. In 2016, a region in the northwest of the nation hit 54 degrees Celsius (127.2 degrees Fahrenheit). That's the third highest temperature ever recorded on Earth \u2014 the highest in recent history. Last year, there were 19 days where temperatures soared to 50 degrees Celcius\u00a0or higher, according to the forecast service AccuWeather. \u00a0 The sweltering heat waves can make the country almost unlivable. Birds have dropped dead from the sky and seahorses have boiled to death in the bay, news agency AP\u00a0reported. Rising sea temperatures could also cause maritime species to migrate to other areas, threatening the local fish industry. \u00a0 Pigeons take cover to escape the heat as best they can For humans, being exposed to these scorching temperatures for prolonged periods of time could result in heat exhaustion, cardiovascular problems or even death. \u00a0 Those who can, seek refuge from the scorching temperatures in malls or their air-conditioned homes and offices. The need for artificial cooling is one of the driving factors behind Kuwait's high fossil-fueled energy use. A 2020 study found that about 67% of electricity used in residences comes from air conditioning. Another major factor is that the government subsidizes electricity costs so heavily that residents don't have an incentive to curb their consumption.\u00a0 Those who can, try to seek refuge in air-conditioned homes, offices and malls But some don't have the luxury of escaping indoors. Kuwait has a significant population of migrants \u2013 about 70%, according to the International Organization for Migration. Many of them work outdoors in construction, agriculture or delivery. A ScienceDirect study found that non-Kuwaiti males were at a higher risk of dying when temperatures rose than local men.\u00a0 Many migrants don't have the luxury of escaping indoors The country has also seen more frequent dust storms, flooding and rising levels. All effects that inhabitants are taking note of, according to a report by the London School of Economics. \u00a0 Still, many aren't aware of the root causes of the crisis. Older generations in particular are more likely to write off climate issues as an act of God and to be more resistant to solutions like public transport, the study said.\u00a0 Sand and dust storms have become more frequent in Kuwait Environmentalists are alarmed that this lack of urgency can also be felt at a policy level. \u00a0 Oil-rich neighbors Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have already pledged net-zero emissions in the coming decades. But Kuwait's promise at the COP26 summit in Glasgow last year was comparatively timid: The country aims to cut 7.4% of greenhouse emissions by 2035. Kuwait's energy demand is set to triple by 2030 \u00a0 For now, the Gulf nation is still completely dependent on fossil fuels for energy. But the energy demand will triple by 2030, according to its Ministry of Electricity and Water. A possible factor could be the country's unsustainable electricity usage, but also the fact that rising temperatures will drive more and more people to indoor cooling. \u00a0 Without diversifying its energy sources, Kuwait risks not sustaining its own guzzling consumption. But more importantly it risks making parts of its country uninhabitable. \u00a0 The country could become uninhabitable if it doesn't take climate change seriously Edited by: Tamsin Walker Whether it's heat or heavy rain, the consequences of climate change are putting our energy security at risk. Oil, gas and nuclear energy are particularly vulnerable. So what does that mean for our future?\n\u00a0 As world leaders meet in France to discuss ocean protection, two major studies show how burning fossil fuels and throwing away plastic waste have created unprecedented environmental catastrophes for marine life. \u00a0 Rising temperatures are leading to a surge in demand for cooling.

{"id": null, "body": "     On World Meteorological Day, DW provides an overview of how global warming is changing our lived experience of the climate. News of the hottest year,\u00a0the wettest winter and\u00a0suffocating summers are no longer a surprise.\u00a0We're getting used to extreme weather - and that's worrying. In 2016, Earth's surface reached its warmest temperatures since 1880.\u00a0It was the third year in a row to set a global record, as\u00a0confirmed in the recently published World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2016. Not surprisingly, 2017 is also expected to follow the trend, even though\u00a0February 2017 was slightly cooler than the same month last year. During the 20th century, the average temperature on Earth increased by around 1.8 degree Fahrenheit (1\u00a0Celsius). That may not\u00a0seem much. But for comparison,\u00a0temperatures during the last ice age were only 5 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than today, according to NASA. Small changes in temperature mean huge changes for the environment, and the Earth's climate record shows such fluctuations have been extremely rare historically. Violent weather Extreme weather events used to occur on average only once in 100 years, but climate change is increasing their frequency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u00a0warns. And people and ecosystems around the world are feeling the impact. Hurricane Matthew \u00a0 had devastating consequences in Haiti and part of the United States. Severe droughts and floods in 2016 have affected millions of people around the world. Australia recently saw a severe heat wave \u00a0and after years of\u00a0severe drought, California is now dealing with extreme floods.\u00a0 In May, Canada suffered its most damaging wildfire - and most costly natural disaster - ever. Some months later, the United States also experienced\u00a0its most destructive wildfire in modern history. Europe hasn't escaped either. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had their wettest winter on record. Intense flooding hit France and Germany during May and June 2016, while France had its driest July and August on record. European natural wonders such as the Alps are also at risk . The mountainous area is heating up twice as fast as the global average, which could lead to fire seasons lasting 30 to 50 days longer by 2050. \u00a0 In March 2017, much of Peru is under a state of emergency due to devastating floods. While some of these events are directly related to human activity and climate change, some remain under question. Flooding in Peru has precipitated a humanitarian crisis Climate change to blame The 2016 European Environmental Agency\u00a0report on climate change impacts, stated that global climate change had significantly increased the probability of extreme climate events in Europe. Despite a range of factors leading to extreme weather, the vast majority of scientists have no doubt that extreme weather is connected to climate change. While climate change may not be directly causing\u00a0such events it is to blame for the increasing frequency and strength with which they hit. Referring to Peru's recent floods, Mojib Latif, a professor of oceanology and climate dynamics at GEOMA (the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in\u00a0Kiel, Germany), said El Nino events have indeed become more frequent and stronger\u00a0in recent decades.\u00a0 Hundreds of residents were evacuated in California during severe floods on February 2017 The extreme El Nino climate pattern\u00a0corresponds to\u00a0climate change models, he said. However, he emphasized, it is still unclear whether this will become a trend. While causes of recent natural disasters are still questioned, a recent study published in Nature Climate Change \u00a0exposes\u00a0a close relationship between global warming and concrete climate events. Peak temperatures influence precipitation rates: For every additional degree Celsius, precipitation\u00a0rates can increase from 5 to 10 percent. For scientists, the link between fossil fuel emissions and global warming that is contributing to extreme weather is also beyond question. \"With carbon dioxide reaching a record annual average concentration of 400 parts per million\u00a0in the atmosphere, the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident,\" Petteri Taalas, WMO secretary general, said in the report. Disastrous consequences Drought has left millions of people - mainly in Africa - starving because crops have failed, while flooding has displaced thousands of communities in Southeast Asia, the WMO reports. Agricultural production is at risk\u00a0in countries\u00a0affected by flooding\u00a0- not to mention those hit by natural disasters such as hurricanes. That not only\u00a0puts food security at risk, but has broader economic impacts.\u00a0 For example, in Australia a threat to agricultural production could have major consequences, as it represents one of the main pillars of the country's economy, the Australian Climate Council reported. Extreme weather events linked to global warming have reprecussions throughout society.\u00a0 The Union of Concerned Scientists mentions, among others:\u00a0public health impacts, infrastructural and economic costs, and the destruction of biodiversity. In cooler climes such as Germany,\u00a0an early sping might put a smile on many people's faces. But its global consequences threaten to create\u00a0a very bleak future.\u00a0 Scientists have been able to more directly link extreme weather, like the floods that hit Central Europe last month, to climate change. A changed climate could also mean hotter summers - and with that, more deaths. (30.06.2016)\n\u00a0 Hurricane Matthew has moved on, but people from Haiti to the US are still dealing with its deadly effects. DW asked an expert whether climate change is making these storms more dangerous - and what we can do to prepare.

{"id": null, "body": "     Researchers agree that climate change alone cannot be blamed for the outbreak of war in Syria in 2011. However, neither can it be ignored as a reason the once blossoming country has become a parched, war-torn place. Drought, war, and no peace in sight - life for most Syrians remains a challenge including having enough potable water \"Syria serves as prime example for the impact of climate change on pre-existing issues such as political instability, poverty and scarce resources,\" Jamal Saghir, Professor at the Institute for the Study of International Development at McGill University, told DW. Saghir, a former director at the World Bank, considers\u00a0 climate change the world's biggest threat to security. He therefore sees the recent acknowledgment of climate change as a national security issue by US Secretary of Defense, Lloyd J. Austin III, on January 27, as game changer when it comes to recognizing the link between climate change and conflict. The last drought from 2006-2010 was the fiercest since droughts have been recorded, or about 900 years In the past, Syria's farmers have benefited from relatively fertile and productive lands, as well as the state's promotion\u00a0of staple crop\u00a0production\u00a0between the 1970s and\u00a01990s.\u00a0The country\u00a0of around 17 million people has been hit by three droughts\u00a0since the 1980s. The most recent stretched from\u00a02006 to 2010, and was recorded as the worst multiyear drought in around 900 years. Decreased precipitation combined with rising temperatures resulted in desertification and devastation of agricultural land, particularly in eastern Syria. Along with this, 800,000 people lost their income and 85% of the country's livestock died. Since crop yields had also plummeted by up to two-thirds, the country had to start importing large quantities of grain. Consequently, food prices doubled. \"But the drought still continued and people were hopeless,\" Saghir said, thus explaining why 1.5 million rural workers headed to the cities for work. Those who\u00a0stayed\u00a0were mainly impoverished farmers who became easy targets for terrorist recruiters from\u00a0groups like\u00a0the so-called Islamic State (IS). \"Climate disruption was an amplifier and multiplier of the political crisis that was building up in Syria,\" as Staffan de Mistura, former UN Special Envoy for Syria between 2014 and 2018, told DW. The crisis was aggravated by Bashar Assad's decisions to reduce fuel, water\u00a0and food subsidies over the years. In addition to water scarcity in rural areas, tensions rose between Kurds, Arabs, Alawites and Sunnis. ISIS sought to capture the Mosul and Fallujah dams in Iraq, as well as the Iraqi regions of Zumar, Sinjar, and Rabiah to gain control of the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates as well as water sources in Syria \"A toxic cocktail started to turn into an explosive mixture with the ingredients of the Arab Spring, the anger of losing jobs, migration to cities, as well as the purchasing power decline and the anger against the very tough and very cruel reactions by the government,\"\u00a0de Mistura said. Geopolitically, the situation didn't become any easier with ongoing competition over Syria between archenemies Iran and Saudi Arabia. \"We started seeing horrible medieval sieges around many cities or villages when people were cut off from food and water, like in Homs or Aleppo,\" de Mistura remembered. When he left the country in 2018, there was less fighting, with 60% of the population under government control. \"From my point of view, the country is now no longer in danger of a major war, but in danger of a collapse,\" de Mistura told DW.\u00a0 According to Amnesty International, 6.6 million people have been displaced within Syria and more than 5 million people have escaped since 2011. Though the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) say that in 2019 around 82,500 people returned to Syria, and around 412,000 internally displaced people returned to their places of origin, problematic living conditions haven't improved. Vast parts of the country have been devastated by\u00a0war, water remains\u00a0scarce \u00a0and infrastructure is in dire need repair across almost the entire country. Many regions in Syria have no access to running water, and distribution is even more difficult in the northeast due to conflicting political responsibilities \"Assad has almost won the territorial war but is still very far from winning peace,\" said\u00a0de Mistura at an online conference hosted by Berghof Foundation and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). Former World Bank director Jamal Saghir agrees: \"For peace, you need reconstruction,\" he said and added that any peace agreement needs to be backed\u00a0by an investment package. However, Syria itself won't be able to finance its reconstruction and it remains to be seen if either of its\u00a0allies Russia or Turkey will be\u00a0willing to invest in Syria's future. According to Saghir, it is obvious what needs to be done: \"It is imperative to make Syria more resilient by helping transitioning the region to a more energy and water-secure infrastructure.\"\u00a0 \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "How climate change paved the way to war in Syria", "article_name": "how-climate-change-paved-the-way-to-war-in-syria", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/how-climate-change-paved-the-way-to-war-in-syria/a-56711650", "date_published": "2021-02-26 00:00:00", "article_length": 5214, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:15.062606"}
{"id": null, "body": "     With a new global agreement to guide governments toward climate protection, personal action is more important than ever. From riding your bike to shopping organic, here are some simple ways you can help save the climate.  1. Use less energy Most greenhouse gases are emitted by power plants, industry and traffic. By using energy efficiently, you can save fossil fuels and protect the climate. So switch lights and appliances off when you aren't using them, and make sure your buildings are well-insulated so you don't waste energy on heating and cooling.  2. Produce clean energy Electricity doesn't have to come from fossil fuel-fired power plants. Alternatives like solar are even getting less expensive. Producing power yourself isn't hard - there's lots of space for solar panels on your roof, and by now the technology is well-established.  3. Support good ideas More and more communities, companies and cooperatives are investing in renewable energies and selling clean power. The solar park pictured above belongs to Saerbeck. The German town with 7,200 inhabitants produces more power than it needs, and is an international role model.  4. Pull your money out of climate-damaging businesses The number of citizens, funds, insurance agencies, universities and cities that are divesting from fossil fuels is growing. M\u00fcnster is the first city in Germany to have joined the divestment movement. Globally, 57 cities have already done the same. Investors of all stripes can divest from fossil fuels, making for a dynamic global movement.  5. Switch to bike, bus and tram Traveling by bike, bus or train saves a lot of CO2. Compared to a car, a bus is five times more climate-friendly - and an electric-powered train is 15 times more climate-friendly! Most people living in Amsterdam bike everywhere. The city takes good care of its cyclists, with its well-kept bike lanes.  6. Eat less meat Methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is generated in the stomachs of cows, sheep and goats. Eating less meat means fewer animals are generating methane. Another reason that large-scale livestock farming and meat consumption are bad for the climate is that it uses such a large amount of resources, including water, and land to grow feed. Rainforests are even cut down to grow soy that is then fed to cows.  7. Buy organic  Laughing gas is no laughing matter - the damaging gas contributes up to 6 percent toward the greenhouse effect. It's generated in power plants and engines - but mostly by artificial fertilizers in industrial agriculture. Use of the gas is prohibited in ecologically oriented farming, so the more that happens, the less laughing gas is emitted. And that helps protect the climate.  8. Build and consume sustainably A lot of carbon dioxide is produced from production of steel and cement. Wood and bamboo, on the other hand, bind CO2. Consciously choosing products made from sustainable materials helps the climate. The same is true for other everyday consumer choices: drinking a cup of coffee at the cafe uses less resources - and fossil fuels - than getting a cup of coffee to go.  9. Take responsibility How can we keep down greenhouse gas emissions so that all children across the world - and their children - can live without climate catastrophes? Make responsible choices. These students are fascinated by clean energy and see it as an opportunity for their future.  10. Don't act alone Perhaps one of the best things an individual can do is not be an individual. Climate activist Bill McKibben points out that coming together in movements is likely to be more effective in changing the systems and structures that are causing the problem. World leaders call it a historic climate pact. Others say the agreement does not go far enough and might remain an empty shell. DW takes a closer look.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change is a ubiquitous threat to species around world. But research by Australian scientists shows that some older, familiar enemies of biodiversity shouldn't be forgotten. Images of climate change are always arresting: Sometimes they come in the form of melting masses of ice, sometimes as torrential rivers or enduring droughts. The impact is always massive and visually striking and it lasts, regardless of the actual effects global warming is having. Because of that, climate change is often a focus of journalistic coverage and so other threats to biodiversity are pushed to the background, although that doesn't make them any less important. In an article in the journal Nature, researchers from the University of Queensland in Brisbane (Australia) are calling for a stronger focus on these threats. Among them is the excessive exploitation of natural resources, but also the issues of agriculture and urbanization. Researchers fear that if these problems are ignored, conservation priorities could be misplaced.  In the shadow of climate change In total, they analyzed almost 8,700 species that are already on the IUCN's Red List of threatened species. They concluded that 72 percent of these species are threatened because humans, especially in industrialized nations, exploit the planet's resources excessively. Deforestation is an example of that. As many as 4,000 of the species they looked at are directly or indirectly affected by deforestation, the tropical Bornean wren-babbler, for example, the Indian Nicobar shrew or Myanmar's snub-nosed monkey, the researchers write.   In urban spaces species aren't necessarily always displaced by urbanization - some of them find new ecological niches. Since 1987, the excessive consumption of natural resources has been illustrated by the Global Footprint Network as part of \"Earth Overshoot Day.\" The organization marks the day each year when humanity has consumed all the resources it has available for that year. In 1987, that day arrived on December 19, but by 2016, the months it took to arrive at that date had reduced significantly to August 8. Researchers named agriculture as a second important factor. Its impact shouldn't be forgotten in the face of climate change either. Sixty-two percent of the Red List-species investigated were affected directly by agriculture because their habitats had disappeared to make way for agricultural land. Just the cultivation of grain alone has impacted 4,600 species, among them the Fresno kangaroo rat and the African wild dog. Almost 2.5 billion tons of grain are harvested each year but not even half of that is eaten. Instead, it is turned into animal feed or fuel. The third underestimated threat listed by the researchers is increasing urbanization, another cause of habitat loss. However, urban spaces are different from agriculture and the exploitation of resources. According the University of Copenhagen study, species aren't necessarily always displaced by urbanization - some of them find new ecological niches.  Generally speaking, most species they investigated face several threats, the researchers wrote. The most important thing is to not only to focus on climate change when it comes to conservation efforts. Climate change could indeed become a major threat to biodiversity in the future, but the so-called 'old enemies' cannot be ignored either.

{"id": null, "body": "     \nHuman activity has led to widespread land degradation and put our very survival as a species at risk. But by reversing course, we can tackle climate change and biodiversity loss \u2014 and make a better life for billions.\n In India and Pakistan, indigenous water management techniques have mitigated climate risks, helping boost food production In what is a comparatively short time on the planet, humans have had a profound effect on global ecosystems. With our farms, cities and way of life, we've transformed vast swaths of Earth \u2014 croplands, grasslands, forests and wetlands \u2014 from their natural state, in many cases leaving them worse for wear . As a new UN report points out , between 20 to 40% of the world's total land area has been degraded by human activity, especially in South Asia, South America and sub-Saharan Africa. That is putting the lives and livelihoods of around half of the world's population at risk and contributing significantly to climate change . Agriculture, economic development and cattle farming have contributed to deforestation across the Amazon rainforest But the report, which highlights how land restoration can help contribute to recovery and greater resilience, also stresses that we know how to stop and reverse the damage we've caused \u2014 not with future technology but with existing tools and know-how. And those places which have already begun investing in restoration projects are seeing the benefits. \"Ecological restoration is something that can address the twin crises of biodiversity and climate change, while also benefiting local human communities, providing jobs, providing food, providing clean water, clean air [and] reducing illness and disease,\" Bethanie Walder, executive director of the Society for Ecological Restoration, a US-based organization which supports global restoration efforts, told DW. \"Conservation alone is no longer enough.\" Bringing beavers back to the UK has helped to reduce the risk of floods and protect biodiversity and water quality Louise Baker, who leads the operational side of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification , told DW that the gains from a restoration economy often far outweigh the initial cost. Every dollar invested in restoring degraded land, she said, quoting an estimate from the World Resources Institute, can result in between $7 to $30 (about \u20ac6.50 to \u20ac28) in economic benefits. \"It requires a shift in the way that you see the land and the soil, not just as a thing that's there, but as a part of a circular economy ,\" said Baker. \"But if you see it as part of a circular economy, then you can build new business models around it.\" The Great Green Wall aims to restore landscapes in a 8,000-kilometer (5,000-mile) swath across Africa One of the standout examples of restoration is Africa's Great Green Wall . The initiative, which got its start in 2007, aims to restore degraded landscapes across the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Though supported by 21 countries in Africa and international partners like the Green Climate Fund, the World Bank and the European Commission, Baker said local communities have taken the lead. \"What's exciting about the Great Green Wall is that this is really African leadership,\" said Baker. Progress on the initial goal, a vast green barrier of trees, has faltered in part due to poor planning and worsening climate conditions; as of 2020, only 4% of the original goal had been met in the initial intervention zone, and 18% in the wider region. But Baker said the initiative has now shifted its focus to smaller, more resilient community-led projects to counter desertification and boost local agriculture. \"It's a mosaic of good land uses, doing the right thing in the right place at the right time, and trying to bring back the health and productivity of the land. But at the same time, it's making the populations and the environment more climate resilient,\" she said. Farmers in Niger have reintroduced traditional techniques that mix trees with agricultural land In Niger, for example, farmers have started to reverse decades of deforestation and land degradation by bringing back a traditional technique that mixes trees with agricultural land. These native trees boost crop growth and improve the health of the soil, while also providing people with additional food, fodder and fuel, making their lives easier . \"It's important to put people at the center,\" said Baker. \"If you live in an area that's horribly degraded and wracked by climate change, you don't stay and you don't invest.\" By 2030, the Great Green Wall aims to restore 1 million square kilometers (about 386,000 square miles) of degraded land across the continent, sequestering 250 million tons of carbon and creating 10 million green jobs \u2014 a vision of a better future that, as Baker pointed out, is more likely to get people to stay and invest in their community. Up to half of Indonesia's peatlands have been degraded, leading to increased wildfires Meanwhile, in Southeast Asia , where some 24% of the land has been degraded by human activity, Indonesia has been investing in efforts to protect and restore its peatlands , which store a significant amount of carbon. Up to half of the country's 140,000 square kilometers of peatland has been drained, logged or taken over by rice and oil palm plantations, resulting in increased wildfires that add to the region's toxic smog. Over the last two decades, national efforts have been introduced to halt and reverse this degradation, including logging restrictions and restoration schemes that have reflooded formerly drained land and brought back native plants and animals. Paludiculture, a sustainable agriculture technique used by farmers to grow crops and raise aquatic animals on wetlands, has given locals an alternative to destructive farming practices. By 2020, the government's Peatland Restoration Agency had restored more than 8,000 square kilometers of peatland , 94% of its target. Uncovering Seoul's Cheonggye Stream has increased biodiversity, reduced the heat island effect and improved quality of life Walder, who has more than 20 years of experience in the field of ecological restoration, said successful projects are becoming increasingly difficult as the effects of climate change intensify . But she hasn't lost hope. \"I truly 100% believe that we have the tools and the knowledge in hand to arrest climate change and to start putting us back on a better track,\" said Walder. \"We have the skill, we have the technology, we just need the will.\" The international commitments, at least, are there. In November 2020, G20 leaders pledged to reduce degraded land in half by 2040. And by the end of last year, the start of the UN's Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, more than 115 countries had made firm commitments to restore a total of 1 billion hectares of farm, forest and pasture area, an area slightly larger than Canada. Urban farms, like this Chinese rice plantation, can help manage stormwater runoff and reduce air pollution and temperatures \"We need everyone, everywhere to engage in restoration and to recognize that if we all act locally, then we can have a global impact,\" said Walder. \"The challenge is how we make restoration the new normal \u2014 how we make it part of our land use planning, how we make it part of our strategies for climate, strategies for food production, strategies for restoration, strategies for life,\" said Baker. \"We really want to make sure that this is embedded in everything that we do.\" Edited by: Tamsin Walker Fires can be catastrophic in rainforests such as the Amazon, but they don't necessarily spell disaster everywhere \u2014 sometimes they help replenish ecosystems. There is even life that needs heat and fire to survive.\n\u00a0 Most people don't even know Canada has a desert - the Okanagan is an anomaly in a country known for snow.

{"id": null, "body": "     Scientists have been exploring the cause of the planet's rising temperature since the 20th century. Climate change skeptics say that human-caused CO2 emissions don't have an effect. DW takes a look at the facts. It's true that within its 4.5-billion-year history, planet Earth has experienced periods of lesser and greater warmth. Altering over many thousands of years, these shifting temperatures have been determined by variations in Earth's orbit around the sun. While greater distances have resulted in colder cycles, shifts closer to the ball of heat\u00a0have led to warmer, interglacial periods.\u00a0 In the late 20th century, when scientists started looking at how temperatures have changed over time, they observed a much faster rate of planetary warming from the 1980s than had previously been recorded.\u00a0 In 1998, researchers from the US University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona published a study showing the average annual global temperature over the past 1,000 years.\u00a0 To work out earlier temperatures going back half a millennium before the\u00a0thermometer was invented, they studied so-called proxy or natural records \u2014 measurements of ice cores, tree rings and corals. The outcome illustrated little variation for many hundreds of years until the 20th century, when there was suddenly a sharp rise.\u00a0 In 2013, research published in the journal Science analyzed\u00a0even earlier temperatures, dating back 11,000 years. The conclusion was the same: our planet has warmed faster in the past century than at any time since the end of the last ice age.\u00a0 The study also revealed that for the last 2,000 years Earth has actually been in a natural cooling period in terms of its position relative to the sun.\u00a0 But this natural cooling has gone unregistered\u00a0due to unprecedented warming caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases, the paper explains.\u00a0 The greenhouse effect \u2014 a natural process that warms the Earth \u2014 is necessary to sustain life on the planet. It happens when certain gases in our atmosphere trap the heat emitted from Earth and act as the planet's very own greenhouse. The natural\u00a0 heat-trapping gases \u00a0in our atmosphere, which include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane\u00a0and nitrous oxide, are necessary to keep the Earth's surface temperature warm. Without the greenhouse gas effect, surface temperatures would drop 33 degrees Celsius (59.4\u00a0degrees Fahrenheit), according to the World Meteorological Organization\u00a0(WMO) \u2014 making the planet a frozen, uninhabitable place. For thousands of years, nature had well-regulated the concentration of these gases. But this started changing\u00a0when humans began\u00a0burning fossil fuels as a global means of creating energy\u00a0\u2014 resulting in a sharp rise of unnatural CO2 emissions.\u00a0This has interfered with the planet's\u00a0atmospheric balance. And, as a result, Earth started warming faster.\u00a0 According to the WMO's\u00a0State of the Global Climate 2020 report, the average temperature last year was 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) higher than pre-industrial levels . This refers to the period between 1850-1900, when fossil fuels were not widely used as a means of creating energy. The report described increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere resulting from human activities, as \"a major driver of climate change\" .\u00a0 In 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere had been 280 parts per million (ppm) for several thousand years before the industrial era. By 1999, it had risen to 367 ppm, the IPCC said.\u00a0 Established as a UN body in 1988, the IPCC has 195 member countries\u00a0and assesses the science related to climate change. It has attributed atmospheric CO2 increase to anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions, with three-quarters of them coming from fossil fuel burning, and the rest from land use change. In May 2021, the average global level of atmospheric CO2 hit 415 ppm . The last time CO2 levels were so elevated was some\u00a03 million years ago, when sea levels were around 30 meters (100 feet) higher and modern humans didn't even exist . Benjamin Cook, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies,\u00a0 said back in the late 20th century, when researchers started to look for answers to explain the warming trend, they examined different factors including greenhouse gases, solar energy, ocean circulation and volcanic activity. \"Only the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and industrialization gave us a prediction that lines up with the warming we're seeing,\" Cook told DW.\u00a0 He said the scientific community is as confident in human-caused climate change today as in the understanding of the theory of gravity. \"There are uncertainties and nuances to discuss in climate science,\" said Cook. \"But the one thing pretty much every scientist agrees upon today is that the warming we're seeing is driven by burning fossil fuels.\"\u00a0 A widely discussed analysis of the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming was published in 2013.\u00a0 Led by John Cook, a researcher with the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Australia's Monash University, American, British and Canadian researchers examined 11,944 climate abstracts published in peer-reviewed scientific literature between 1991 and 2011.\u00a0 Less than 1% of the research papers they reviewed rejected the idea of human influence on our climate. And while 66.4% of the abstracts expressed no position on the anthropogenic factor, 32.6% endorsed it. Further analysis of the latter figure revealed a 97.1% consensus on human-caused climate change. Critics, however, slammed the findings on the basis that the 97.1% consensus was derived from less than a third of all papers reviewed. Most, they argued, had not expressed a view.\u00a0 Scientific consensus, however,\u00a0can't be achieved by voting, but evolves through time as more research is done. Energy production which relies on burning of fossil fuels is the biggest source of CO2 emissions A more recent study conducted by a group of international authors confirmed that over 90% of climate scientists share the consensus that climate change is human-caused. And a 2019 analysis of 11,602 peer-reviewed articles on climate change published in the first seven months of 2019 found scientists have reached 100% agreement on anthropogenic global warming. That research was carried out by a James Lawrence Powell, an American geologist and author of 11\u00a0books on climate change and Earth science. \"If an alternative theory of what is driving climate change rather than greenhouse gases would be supported by research and evidence, such work would be groundbreaking,\" said Benjamin Cook. \"It would be Nobel Prize-level study. But we do not see this research.\"\u00a0 Human-caused\u00a0climate change is endorsed by the IPCC. As far back as 1995, the intergovernmental body said \"the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.\u201d \"A scientific approach means looking at the data, observations and model results to make conclusions,\" said Helene Jacot Des Combes, a climatologist at the University of the South Pacific, IPCC author and adaptation adviser to the Marshall Islands government.\u00a0 \"And this all tells us that the current climate change is caused by human activities.\" This article is part of a series in which DW is debunking myths surrounding climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     From atmospheric physicists to urban climatologists, DW spoke to researchers who study the many and varied aspects of climate change about what concerns them most as our planet heats up. What worries scientists the most when it comes to climate change? We have the answers What really makes this reporter's\u00a0stomach churn\u00a0thinking about climate change? Thawing permafrost. A scenario where it all melts, releasing copious amounts of CO2 and methane (it holds twice as much carbon as the atmosphere holds right now), and there's no going back. But what's at the top of the list of concerns for those who study how climate change is unfolding\u00a0\u2013\u00a0on ice sheets and urban street corners, in oceans and farm fields \u2013 the climate scientists themselves? DW asked a dozen experts spanning climatology, entomology, oceanography and yes, permafrost research, what keeps them up at night when it comes to the climate. Nana Ama Browne Klutse studies changing weather with climate models at the University of Ghana. While she says tipping points like permafrost thaw worry her, she also worries how individuals will handle changing climates. \"What can you do as an individual to avoid the impact of climate change?\" she asked. \"We need government policies for resilience, building of community, city resilience. Then we need that global action.\" Fridays for Future protesters demand climate action from their government in Delhi, India Dry conditions have seen yields of the world's most expensive spice \u2014 saffron \u2014 down by half in the last two decades Climate scientist Ruth Mottram studies the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and sea level rise for the Danish Meteorological Institute, but it's not the science that worries her. \"I'm less concerned that there are unknown processes going on that we don't understand, and there could potentially be some unforeseen catastrophe on the way,\" she said. \"We know\u00a0what a lot of the impacts are going to be. I think what keeps me awake at night in a metaphorical sense is really the interaction between the physical system and how human societies are going to handle it.\" Giving the example of sea level, she says we will see a meter rise this century\u00a0\u2014 in our lifetimes or that of our children\u00a0\u2014 and will have to make tough decisions about our coastal cities. But she says it won't end there. \"I think that human societies have not really grasped what that means and that adaptation to sea level rise is going to be a long process and we are going to be doing it for hundreds of years,\" said Mottram, suggesting that we start thinking in terms of the lifetimes of cities (hundreds of years) rather than just human lifetimes. Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor of geophysics at the University of Alaska Fairbanks' Permafrost Laboratory, said that while he thinks\u00a0about how what happens in the Arctic will affect the rest of the world, his concerns are much more local. \"We should remember that there are still some people living in the Arctic,\" he said. Around 4 million people \u00a0in fact who would have to deal with the real-life consequences of solid ground thawing beneath their feet and houses . \"Changes in these local or regional kind of climates and environments, they impact these people and some of these impacts could be very severe.\" Thawing permafrost will mean literal instability for Arctic communities like Resolute Bay in Nunavut, Canada Deforestation to make way for crops reduces how much carbon dioxide is regularly being taken out of the atmosphere Closer to the planet's other pole, Carolina Vera fears that existing inequalities will only be exacerbated by climate change . \"Climate change is already impacting the most vulnerable sectors of our planet,\" said Vera, who studies climate variability as\u00a0a principal researcher for the National Council of Science of Argentina,\u00a0a professor at the University of Buenos Aires and chief of staff for Argentina's Ministry of Science and Technology. Her work has led her to incorporate local knowledge and data collection into studies , involving communities that are balancing the problems of deforestation with their need to farm. Perhaps not surprisingly, global heating \u00a0is a key concern for many researchers, like Dim Coumou, who studies extreme weather at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Of most concern to him are heat and humidity extremes in the tropics \u2013 especially highly populated parts like West Africa, Pakistan and India\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which will make it unbearable to be outside. When cooling down by sweating is no longer possible, people can't work outside and therefore\u00a0can't grow food. The likely result being mass migration . But it's not just the tropics. Closely related to heat is the increase in extreme weather brought on by a warming climate. Coumou and his colleagues' research shows how changes to the jet stream will lead to more extreme weather in Europe , including floods and droughts. A warmer ocean can lead to floods in certain areas and drought in others \u2014 both threaten drinking water supplies Certain types of extreme weather like hurricanes will continue to get stronger as the planet warms up This increase in extreme weather is climate scientist Abubakr Salih Babiker's biggest climate concern. \"A warmer atmosphere can hold more water in it and when it rains, it rains heavily leading to floods. A warmer ocean can lead to stronger tropical cyclones,\" said Babiker, who works for the East African Climate Center\u00a0ICPAC in Nairobi. He explained that cyclones gain\u00a0more energy from warmer water. \"We have seen evidence of all these events,\" he said. \"The strongest tropical cyclones to impact the Arabian Peninsula, Somalia, and Mozambique occurred in the past 20 years!\" And extreme weather events can bring\u00a0further ecological disasters along with them, like swarms of locusts , as Babiker and his colleagues have found in their research . East Africa saw its worst locust plague in decades in 2020, threatening crops and food security Mozambique was hit hard by Cyclone Idae in 2019 and subsequent flooding has made it difficult to rebuild Pests, drought and flooding are on Esther Ngumbi's mind too. An entomologist and professor of African American studies\u00a0at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, she said that what keeps her up at night is the thought: \"How can my science truly help?\" Ngumbi's work on pest\u00a0and drought-resistant crops is driven by her concerns for vulnerable farmers who live in countries lacking social safety nets, where one season of crop devastation due to insects can mean going hungry and being unable to pay for their children's education. \"That truly makes me wake up every day and go to the lab to understand how my research can contribute to solutions that we need,\" she said. Natasha Picone \u2013 an urban climatologist at the National University of Central Buenos Aires \u2013 says it's the solutions that occupy her thoughts too. \"With the pandemic, I realized that we are not doing enough for changing our cities to be more livable,\" she said. Her research informs urban planners \u00a0about\u00a0phenomena such as\u00a0the urban heat island effect, air pollution and urban run-off that can lead to flooding. \"If we don't change the path now, it will be really difficult to go back.\" Cities guzzle more than two-thirds of the world's energy and are responsible for 70% of carbon emissions, according to the UN. They're also home to more than half of the people on the planet. With urban populations only expected to get bigger, how these centers deal with water, pollution, waste, transport and energy will be crucial for tackling climate change. Copenhagen aims to become the world's first carbon-neutral city by 2025. To get there, the Danish capital wants 75% of all trips to be done on foot, by bike, or by public transport. It's hiked the price of car parking and invested in hundreds of kilometers of roads just for bicycles. The city's district heating system \u2014 serving 99% of the buildings \u2014 is also switching to sustainable biomass. The Colombian capital's bus rapid transit system has brought down CO2 emissions and improved air quality since it was launched in 2000, UN data shows. Bogota's TransMilenio network moves 2.4 million passengers a day and covers 85% of the city. The government also plans to open a metro in 2022 and replace diesel buses with hybrid and electric models by 2024. Africa has the fastest urban growth in the world, adding to climate-related challenges such as food and water insecurity. In Johannesburg, South Africa, people like Lethabo Madela, 30, have started urban farms to grow herbs, vegetables and crops to feed their communities. Officials told Reuters there were 300 such farms in the city of 4.4 million \u2014 on rooftops, backyards and empty lots. Beyond providing food, gardens can also help cool cities down, absorb CO2 and prevent flooding. Business hub Singapore is known for its impressive network of green areas and parks, including its iconic Gardens by the Bay. All new buildings in the densely populated city-state must have some form of vegetation, such as hanging gardens or a green roof. Norway's capital wants to tackle air pollution by making all cars in the city emission-free by 2030. Oslo, home to some 690,000 people, currently has the highest number of electric vehicles per capita in the world. Drivers get perks like tax credits, access to bus lanes, and free travel on toll roads. During periods of high pollution, the city can also temporarily ban diesel cars from the center. Seoul has managed to reduce waste dramatically since the 1990s by introducing a \"pay-as-you-throw\" system. The densely populated South Korean city recycles 95% of its food waste, for example, with automated bins that weigh scraps and charge residents for what they discard using scannable ID cards. The food waste is then turned into compost, animal feed, or biofuel. Rotterdam is vulnerable to climate threats such as rising tides because most of the city is below sea level. In order to protect itself from flooding, the Dutch port has built rooftop gardens to absorb runoff, \"water plazas\" to catch rainwater and parking garages designed to serve as reservoirs. It's also building floating structures \u2014 including this dairy farm \u2014 to withstand encroaching waters. Iceland can produce renewable energy fairly cheaply thanks to its abundance of hydro and geothermal resources. The capital Reykjavik was the first European city to be able to rely entirely on clean power for its electricity, as well to heat homes and swimming pools. Fossil fuels are still used in transport and fisheries, but the city is hoping to phase those emissions out by 2040. Buildings are a major source of emissions in cities because of the power they use for lighting, cooling and heating. Vancouver aims to make all new buildings carbon neutral by 2030, and to retrofit old buildings by 2050. One example: The Vancouver Convention Centre (above) has a massive green roof with 400,000 plants that serves as insulation. It also uses seawater for heating and cooling. Author: Natalie Muller Young activists like this girl here in Medellin, Colombia remind us that \"there is still time to protect our forests\" Weighing on the mind of oceanographer Renata Hanae Nagai at the University of Parana\u00a0in Brazil is her four-year-old nephew and what his life will look like in a warmer world, but he also gives her hope. During a recent trip to the beach to watch nesting turtles, he warned others to leave the turtles alone. She sees this same care in her students \u2013 learning about problems and coming up with solutions. \"People are the solution,\" she said. \"We try, even under the hardest conditions.\" Levke Caesar, whose research recently made headlines , said the most concerning thing for her is the people and organizations who deny climate change . \"For me, that's like morally totally unacceptable what they do \u2013 they lie,\" said the climate physicist from Maynooth University in Ireland, reflecting on encountering such people at public talks. \"I mean, you can't argue with climate.\" But this only pushes Caesar to better communicate what the science shows. Many climate scientists we interviewed said they're working to better communicate their research to the public A common thread of this\u00a0(rather unscientific) survey is that while we\u00a0laypeople might be worrying about what the science says, climate scientists are often worrying about us. \"Scientists always think about what are the results of their studies, how are they important for, you know, for usual people, for normal people,\" the permafrost scientist told me. While doing his research, Romanovsky said he's always thinking about \"how this could be used to make life of people easier or more predictable.\" Cutting greenhouse gas emissions would not only slow global heating, it would also ensure our food remains nutritious. When plants absorb excess CO2, they produce less protein and fewer nutrients like zinc and iron. Deficiencies in those nutrients can result in many health problems, especially in children. If CO2 keeps rising, hundreds of millions more people will face chronic undernutrition. Outdoor air pollution causes around 4.2 million deaths a year, due to illness like heart disease and lung cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Burning fossil fuels to power vehicles, homes and industry as well as agriculture and waste incineration is behind much of that pollution. Switching away from climate-killing fuels to green energy would benefit human and planetary health. Plant and animal species are declining at an unprecedented rate. But these species and the ecosystems in which they live provide the services central to all life on Earth, including our own. They deliver food, energy, clean air and water, and provide the basis for many medicines and livelihoods. Protecting the integrity of ecosystems ensures the health of communities around the world. More than half the world's population lives in urban areas, and that figure is rising. Those living in cities are already experiencing air pollution from road traffic and industry. Creating a greener transport network that includes trains, bikes and plenty of room for pedestrians would improve air quality, reduce noise pollution and traffic accidents as well as encourage a more active lifestyle. Driving biodiversity loss is the transformation of habitat for industrial or agricultural use, such as the destruction of forests in Borneo for palm oil plantations. Changing land use could be pushing the emergence and spread of infectious disease, while runoff from agriculture and industry pollutes water and air. Promoting protected areas and sustainable land use would help on both scores. Global warming is making extreme weather, such as super storms, wildfires, flooding and serious drought, more likely. According to the WHO, weather-related disasters cause more than 60,000 deaths a year, mainly in developing countries. Adaptation measures and limiting warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels would lessen the health impacts and future death tolls. Destruction wrought by extreme weather can cause post-traumatic stress in those caught up in the events, particularly if people are forced to flee their homes and cannot return for some time. Climate and environmental breakdown are thought to be affecting the mental well-being of people around the world. Protecting nature and combating climate change would reduce the toll on mental health. Author: Jennifer Collins When added to existing conflicts or tense relations, water can be an accelerant.

{"id": null, "body": "     French lawmakers in the lower house of parliament have approved a measure that could lead to climate change protections being added to the constitution. The bill is supported by French President Emmanuel Macron. French members of parliament on Tuesday threw their support behind legislation that could enshrine climate change protections in the country's constitution. French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to hold\u00a0a public\u00a0referendum on the new constitutional clause if it passes both houses of parliament. The bill passed in the lower house of parliament, with the approval of 391 deputies and 47 against. The lower house is dominated by Macron's centrist En Marche party, but the legislation faces a tougher battle in the Senate, where the right-wing Republicans hold a majority. The legislation would be the first step in adding the following line to article 1 of the French constitution: \"The Republic guarantees the preservation of biodiversity and the environment and fights against climate change.\" Marine Le Pen, the president of the far-right RN party, will likely be Macron's top presidential challenger next year Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, likely one of Macron's top opponents in the upcoming 2022 election, has slammed the bill as \"political posturing.\" Le Pen is slated to present her own environmental proposals next week. Other right-wing opponents believe the new constitutional clause could hurt France's private sector. Some left-wing parties, along with non-governmental organizations, have characterized Macron's support for the bill as a shallow PR victory ahead of next year's elections. If the bill passes both houses of parliament, it would be the first time the French voted in a public referendum since 2005. That year, the French voted against the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. The possible new line of the French constitution was proposed by the Citizens' Convention on Climate, a\u00a0 public body of 150 members formed in the wake of the \"yellow vest\" protests in 2018. Macron has rejected some of the body's proposals, including a 4% green tax on company dividends. Macron also shot down a proposition from the convention that would rewrite the French constitution's preamble to include climate change protections\u00a0as a primary goal. wd/aw (AFP, dpa)\n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "France: MPs rally behind bill enshrining climate change protections in constitution", "article_name": "france-mps-rally-behind-bill-enshrining-climate-change-protections-in-constitution", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/france-mps-rally-behind-bill-enshrining-climate-change-protections-in-constitution/a-56892665", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 2406, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:18.522231"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Burning fossil fuels to meet rising energy demand has pushed carbon dioxide emissions to a record high. Can innovation save us from global warming? It's a question that preys on our readers' minds: Can we invent our way out of climate breakdown? For many, dismayed by the pace of political progress but loathe to give up carbon-heavy lifestyles , solving climate change through technology alone is a tantalizing idea. But experts say there is no silver bullet to protect the climate \u2014 and that keeping fossil fuels in the ground is the surest known way to prevent further warming. Average temperatures have risen by 1 degree Celsius since countries first industrialized and are projected to rise about 3 degrees Celsius above that baseline by the end of the century without sharp, severe cuts to CO2 emissions. A report from the Global Carbon Project found in December that while coal-burning has largely plateaued, the rise of oil and natural gas is pushing the planet further away from its climate goals. How can technology help governments get there? Here are four innovations that energy experts told us hold promise for slowing the march of climate change. Solar panels and wind turbines What may be the biggest innovation to combat climate change has been around for decades. Solar panels and wind turbines turn sun and wind into electricity without releasing greenhouse gases. As the technologies have scaled up and converted energy more efficiently, they have come down in price to become cheaper than fossil fuels globally. \"Solar and wind being cheap and reliable and performing well opens up a lot of possibilities,\" said Gregory Nemet, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has written a book on how solar energy became cheap. \"Even as we've had 30 years of politicians dithering and not as much progress as most people would have hoped, in the background, technology has been progressing.\" But generating clean energy is one thing \u2014 storing and distributing it is another. This is particularly important for renewables that cannot generate electricity without the sun shining or wind blowing. Three things suggest innovation is overcoming these hurdles, said Nemet. \"That's renewables getting better, batteries allowing you to store electricity and then information in the system allowing you to manage it better.\" A floating solar plant near Santiago, Chile Wind turbines south of Nairobi, Kenya Batteries for electric vehicles The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded three scientists a Nobel prize in October for their work in developing lithium-ion batteries , which they say have \"revolutionized our lives since they first entered the market in 1991\" \u2014 and continue to advance. Lighter and smaller than earlier rechargeable batteries, lithium batteries can also be charged faster and more often. As their weight and price continue to fall, they are playing an increasingly pivotal role in decarbonizing the transport sector by making electric vehicles cheaper. \"Battery storage will be critical,\" said Joao Gouveia, a senior fellow at Project Drawdown, a research organization that analyzes climate solutions. \"It will allow the integration of more and more renewable tech. We cannot have 70% [of renewable energy by 2050] coming from wind and solar if we don't apply battery storage systems.\" Holding batteries back are aging electricity grids and costs that, despite falling each year, remain high. But electric vehicles could act as a storage system, said Gouveia, with owners buying electricity at night to charge their cars and selling it to the grid when demand is high and cars are parked, idle, during the day. \"We are finding new lithium reserves because this is a tech for both markets, so we're innovating more and more.\" While the global electric vehicle fleet has grown rapidly \u2014 passing 5 million cars in 2018, data from the International Energy Agency shows \u2014 this progress has been dwarfed by a rise in larger and less efficient SUVs that run on fossil fuels. Four in 10 new cars sold globally in 2018 were SUVs. A fully electric Mercedes car on display in Stockholm, Sweden Lithium iron batteries could help decarbonize transport Power-to-X Another way to store renewable energy is using electrolyzers to extract hydrogen from water. The process, also known as power-to-X, is a way of storing energy in different forms. Engineers run an electric current through water and collect the hydrogen molecules that break off. These can be burned for heat, stored in fuel cells or turned into chemicals such as methane for processes that require fossil fuels. \"It's a great way to decarbonize the heating, mobility and chemical sector,\" said David Wortmann, a board member of Energy Watch Group, a German NGO. \"It's scaleable \u2014 the tech is all there. The industry is young, you have manufacturers out there to produce an electrolyzer. But the demand is not there yet, the regulations are not in place.\" Hydrogen could also help decarbonize a high-polluting sector that has mostly been overlooked: heavy industry. The high heat needed to process industrial materials \u2014 such as concrete, iron, steel, and petrochemicals \u2014 is responsible for about 10% of global CO2 emissions, according to a report from the Center on Global Energy Policy in October. The cement industry alone is responsible for about 8% of CO2 emissions, mostly in production. This is more than three times the CO2 emissions of the aviation industry. Burning hydrogen from renewable energy sources could meet industrial heating needs cleanly, said Jeff Rissmann, head of modeling at Energy Innovation, a research firm. \"Moving to hydrogen can have a huge impact across many sectors, and would be one of the biggest ways to decarbonize the global economy.\" Capturing CO2 from power plants is seen as increasingly necessary to reach emissions targets Carbon capture and storage Even under optimistic scenarios for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, scientists say we will not meet targets to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius without removing some of the CO2 we have already emitted. The IPCC projects between 100 billion and 1 trillion tons of CO2 would need to be removed this century. Trees and plants that extract CO2 from the atmosphere and turn it into oxygen through photosynthesis are one way of doing this. But they take up large tracts of land \u2014 which is needed for other purposes such as growing food \u2014 and are not a secure way of storing carbon, because they may be felled for firewood or burned in forest fires. Some companies are experimenting with capturing CO2 from power plants and storing it deep underground. By doing this with biomass plants \u2014 where recently-grown plant matter is burned and not ancient fossils \u2014 then power can be produced while reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. But with just 19 facilities running such systems, its deployment is not happening quickly enough to meet emissions reductions targets, according to a report from the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. Although there is a combination of factors behind the numerous jellyfish that reach vacation havens like the Mediterranean coast, climate change is also partially to blame. Warmer sea temperatures are opening up new areas where jellyfish can reproduce, and increasing the availability of their favorite food: plankton. Prized for their superior sound quality, an original Stradivarius can sell for millions of dollars. Yet, extreme weather events, such as unusually violent storms, are killing millions of trees, putting at risk the famous wood in the Paneveggio forest, in northern Italy. Replanting trees won't help much in the short term. A spruce has to be at least 150 years old before it can become a violin. On very hot nights, people sleep worse, especially in big cities. By 2050 European metropolises may experience temperatures around 3.5 degrees Celsius warmer in summer. It not only affects sleep, but also mood, productivity and mental health. The only way to escape is to move to smaller towns and settlements, where the nights are cooler since there are fewer buildings and more greenery. Spring is starting earlier in the year due to global warmer temperatures \u2014 bad news for allergy sufferers. With a longer frost-free season, plants have more time to grow, bloom and produce pollen. Therefore, pollen will freely roam around much earlier, which will make the suffering season longer and the annual pollen load greater. Will it be the century of masks for air pollution and allergies? Heat not only makes us sweat; it also affects our health. By the end of this century three-quarters of the world's population is expected to be exposed to dangerous and deadly heat waves. Rising temperatures mean an increase in diarrheal diseases, as it's easier for bacteria to multiply in warm food and water. Mosquito numbers will also likely go up, along with the spread of diseases like malaria. Soil in the region around the North Pole is increasingly thawing in the summer months, with dramatic local and global consequences. Warmer temperatures cause floors to become unstable and houses and roads to crack, and leads to many more insects. Moreover, if permafrost \u2014 frozen soil \u2014 melts, it will release CO2 and methane gases that could further exacerbate global warming. It's a vicious circle. Temperature can influence the sex of several species. For sea turtles, the heat of the sand where the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the newborn. Low temperatures benefit male turtles, while females develop better in warmer areas. Researchers have found that over 99% of turtle hatchlings in northern Australia are already female, making it difficult for the species to survive.

{"id": null, "body": "     In the battle to save threatened species from extinction, a new study has found that keeping climate change under 1.5 degrees Celsius could be key. Global warming will hit hardest those animals we depend upon most. The Red List of threatened species \u00a0is getting\u00a0longer every year. Currently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists 5,583 species as critically endangered, including subspecies of animals and plants. Another 20,000 species are classified as endangered or vulnerable. Hunting and poaching are among the top reasons for species endangerment. Take the pangolin: their meat and scales are sought-after as food and for traditional medicine,\u00a0respectively. Some pangolin species are already critically endangered, and their population is still declining. Pangolins could get extinct within 10 years In 2016,\u00a0 the CITES committee put all eight pangolin species on Appendix I, giving them full protection against international trade. That hasn't stopped the illegal animal trade: Pangolins are the most trafficked animals in the world. But illegal animal trade and trafficking are\u00a0among several major factors pushing so many species to the brink. Read more: \u00a0 Five of the world's biggest environmental problems Homeless For many other species, the biggest challenge is habitat loss. All three species of orangutans are threatened with extinction because the trees they live in are being cut down, for example to make room for palm oil plantations. Grasslands are converted into housing estates, and country ponds are drained to set up a barbecue grill instead \u2014\u00a0in our modern industrialized world, many animals and plants have no more room to thrive anymore. And\u00a0 climate change will make matters worse. Species that are adapted to living on savannah\u00a0simply cannot survive when their savannah turns to desert.\u00a0 \"Every species has a preferred climate. Just as you and I don't like it too hot or too cold, too wet or too dry,\" Rachel Warren\u00a0of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, United Kingdom, tells DW. Polar bears are by far not the only living creatures to suffer in a warming world Warren and her colleagues in East Anglia\u00a0and at the James Cook University in Australia studied some 115,000 species around the globe, examining their habitats and how their geographic range would develop in a warming world. The warmer the climate gets, the more plant and animal species will be at risk of extinction due to habitat loss, they found. Even a 0.5 degree\u00a0Celsius difference can be a matter of existance or extinction for many species, they reported\u00a0Thursday in Science . The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to maximum 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, while aiming \"to pursue efforts\" to limit it to 1.5 degrees. \"We found that achieving the ultimate goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit warming to 1.5 degree above pre-industrial levels, would reap enormous benefits for biodiversity,\"\u00a0Warren said. What a difference in half a degree They investigated three different scenarios: warming of 1.5, 2 and 3.2 degrees Celsius. The latter is the current global warming trajectory if countries meet national pledges to reduce CO2 emissions. The researchers found that with current pledges, about 49 percent of all insects, 44 percent of all plants and 26 percent of all vertebrates would lose half their habitat by 2100. By limiting global warming to 2.0 degrees, this numbers would decrease tremendously,\u00a0to 18 percent, 16 percent and 8 percent. At 1.5 degrees, those\u00a0numbers would be more than halved, to 6 percent\u00a0for insects, 8 percent for plants and 4 percent for vertebrates. Taking the lower limit for global warming would save\u00a0the majority of global species from climate change. Small temperature changes will result in large strides to save species, the study found Christian Hof, a researcher at the\u00a0Senckenberg Center for Biodiversity and Climate in Frankfurt, called the study \"the largest of its kind.\" Hof, who did not participate in the study, called the methodology \"solid\" and added that the large difference in the 2 and 3.2 degree results were surprising.\u00a0 Kirsten Thonicke, a researcher at the\u00a0Potsdam Institut for Climate Research in Potsdam (PIK), pointed out that the study builds off of a WWF study and others before it. She called new the consideration of insects, also the \"astounding\" number of 115,000 species analyzed. She was also not involved in the study. The big winners Species across the globe would benefit from a 1.5 degree warming limit, but particularly those in Southern Africa, the Amazon, Europe and Australia, the researchers write. Among the big winners would be species which are also hit hardest by poaching, such as the critically endangered black rhinoceros, they found. Warren adds that among the species particularly vulnerable to global warming are insects. \"It probably is because they are cold-blooded animals and don't have much control over their body temperature,\" she says, adding that many\u00a0insect species don't have much ability to move to other areas when the climate gets unsuitable for them, such as beetles that live in\u00a0the soil. The black rhinoceros is hit by climate change as well as poaching How we depend on insects Saving insect species from extinction is particularly important, the researchers write: They are at the bottom\u00a0of the food chain and are a main food source for many birds, reptiles\u00a0and mammals. When insects die, a lot of other species will die with them. In addition, insects offer services we humans cannot do without, such as pollinating crops and flowers. The economic value of insect pollination was estimated in a 2005 study at 153 billion euros ($181 billion), accounting for 9.5 percent of global agricultural food production. \"We found that particularly those groups of insects important for pollination are one of the more sensitive ones to global warming.\" Read more: \u00a0 Supply chains at risk as pollinators die out Even without climate change, insects are already in bad shape: intensive farming with monocultural fields\u00a0full of pesticides\u00a0makes life particularly hard for them. Insects have declined by 76 percent \u00a0over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany, one survey found. On Monday, researchers in the Netherlands reported a similar trend in their country: in two Dutch nature reserves, the number of insects has dropped in the same period by about two-thirds. They are the pollination super stars! Honeybees account for about 80 percent of all pollination by insects. They visit a large variety of plants, collecting pollen and nectar taking it back to their hive. Each hive can collect about 66 pounds of pollen every year. As well as the honeybees, there are several thousand wild bee species. Most of those live a solitary life, not in hives. They are bigger and hairier than honeybees, but just as useful: bumblebees also feed on floral nectar, using their long hairy tongues to collect the delicious liquid. Bumblebees are social animals like honeybees, but form much smaller colonies of only about 50 to 600 individuals. Wasps have a bad reputation and the vast majority of wasp species play no role in pollination. That is because wasps have a smooth body without hairs, and pollen doesn't stick to them. Pollen wasps are different, though. They collect pollen and nectar inside their throats and feed their young with it. These little creatures try to look dangerous by imitating the coloring of bees and wasps - but they are harmless and cannot sting. They are often seen hovering above flowers. The adults love nectar and pollen and are important pollinators. Hoverfly larvae are also useful: they feed on aphids and thus help with pest control. They look a bit like a cross between a fly and a bee, hence their name. Bee flies can grow to up to four centimeters. They live in many parts of the world, but are most diverse in the tropics and subtropics. Adult bee flies love pollen and nectar; their larvae, though, feed on the eggs or larvae of other insects. There are more than 18,000 species of butterflies, and most of them are brightly coloured. With their long, thin legs and relatively small bodies, they cannot carry as much pollen as bees. Still, they do a good job pollinating plants. Unlike bees, butterflies can see red which attracts them to different blooms than bees. Moths are less colourful than butterflies, but they still belong to the same family. Moths fly at night. That's why they do not need bright colours. But they also feed on flowering plants. Some moths, and especially their caterpillars, are major agricultural pests, though. Did you know that beetles also play a role in pollination? Some of them do, such as the flower scarab, also called flower beetle. As the name suggest, they visit flowers for pollen and nectar. There are around 4,000 species. One is the green rose chafer (photo). It is not only insects that do the pollinator's job - there are birds on duty as well. Especially birds with long slim bills like hummingbirds carry pollen from one flower to the next when feeding on nectar. Some species of plants have even evolved to produce flowers that appear especially attractive to hummingbirds. Some other birds belonging to the passerine group also appreciate floral nectar. Take this Seychelles sunbird. Its long, slender bill shows that it is specialized on drinking from flower blossoms. This species is especially fond of hibiscus flowers. Bats - including their larger relatives, the fruit bats - play an important role in plant distribution and reproduction. While some bat species prefer insects, others feed on fruit or on nectar. When they drink nectar with their long tongues, they transfer pollen from one blossom to the next. In Madagascar, primates like this mouse lemur pollinate flowers and are even essential to the reproduction of some tree species. They stick their noses into the flowers to drink nectar, and pollen collects on their snouts. Yes, there are even some species of lizard and snake that help with pollination. Researchers found that, especially on islands, lizards are important pollinators. They suspect that lizards have fewer predators on islands and are therefore more numerous. On these islands they can roam around more freely and expand their diet to nectar, pollen and fruit. Author: Brigitte Osterath Worthy of protection Protecting species can pay off in many ways:\u00a0Rich biodiversity guarantees fertile soil, and clean water and air, researchers point out. It might even allow for finding a cure for cancer, for example\u00a0in a type of coral that conservationists have been struggling for years to protect. While limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees could save the majority of species from climate change, the report's authors acknowledge that this might be a difficult goal to achieve. That's why it is important to \"allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change,\" they write, suggesting that enlarging protected area networks could be one way to do so. This would species give the opportunity to move into new suitable habitat. Just a\u00a0bigger nature reserve won't save the pangolins, though. Experts fear that those shy, secretive mammals\u00a0might go extinct within the next 10 years, long before scientists have even a chance to study their behavior and learn more about them. Yet, Warren points out\u00a0that it is important to think about climate change now even if other problems seem more\u00a0urgent. \"If we don't do something about the future, there is a problem waiting around the corner.\"\u00a0 Looks like the IUCN Red List is set to get even longer in the future. Let's start with the good news. According to the latest Red List update, the number of mountain gorillas has significantly increased. The IUCN has said the number of animals has risen from about 680 a decade ago to more than 1,000 now. Intensive conservation action such as removal of snares has contributed to the rebound of the mountain gorilla, which inhabits the Congo region's jungles. Fin whales are now considered vulnerable rather than the more worrisome label of endangered. Their number has roughly doubled since the 1970s, to around 100,000 individuals, according to the IUCN. The situation of gray whales has also been upgraded \u2014 from critically endangered to endangered. Bans on commercial whaling have made a real impact on conservation. Yet the IUCN also issued warnings about the consequences of overfishing. For example, 13 percent of grouper species worldwide and 9 percent of the approximately 450 fish species in Lake Malawi in eastern Africa are threatened with extinction. \"Depleting fish stocks are a serious concern for food security, particularly for coastal communities in developing countries,\" the IUCN said. In a previous Red List update, the Mauritian flying fox \u2014 an important pollinator \u2014 moved from vulnerable to endangered. The bat population fell by a whopping 50 percent from 2015 to 2016 due largely to government-implemented culling sparked by alleged damage to fruit crops. The megabat species also faces threats from deforestation, illegal hunting and an increase in cyclone activity. Invasive species are threatening a number of unique Australian reptiles. This grassland earless dragon has shifted from vulnerable to endangered. It often falls prey to feral cats, as well as changes to the intensity and frequency of bushfires. Like most native Australian wildlife, the reptile is adapted to environmental conditions that existed before European settlement. Taking its name from \"The Lord of the Rings\" character Smeagol \u2014 aka Gollum \u2014 the precious stream toad is also on the list of species threatened with extinction. It is listed as vulnerable, largely as a result of expanding tourist resorts and complexes in its Genting Highlands habitat in Malaysia. The population of keas, New Zealand's Bird of the Year 2017, is declining rapidly, mostly due to tourists who keep feeding the curious parrots junk food. As a result, the birds get used to trying novel food and end up eating poison bait meant to control pests such as rats, stoats, or possums, which destroy up to 60 percent of the birds' nests each year. You can see the connection, can't you? Black-legged kittiwakes rely on certain key prey, like sand eels. But a lack of eels to eat means breeding colonies in the North Atlantic and Pacific are struggling to feed their chicks. Globally, the species is thought to have declined by around 40 percent since the 1970s. The main cause is overfishing and alterations in the ocean due to climate change. The snowy owl is vulnerable, with recent population estimates much lower than previously thought. Climate change has hit the iconic Arctic bird hard, as it has increased snowmelt and reduced the availability of rodent prey. A quarter of bird species reassessed in the Red List, including the snowy owl, have become more endangered. Five species of African antelopes \u2014 of which four were previously assessed as least concern \u2014 have been declining drastically as a result of poaching, habitat degradation and competition with domestic livestock. One of these is the gray rhebok, for which the Reebok sports brand is named. The world's largest antelope, the giant eland \u2014 previously assessed as least concern \u2014 is also vulnerable. Its estimated global population is between 12,000 and 14,000 at most, with fewer than 10,000 mature animals. This species is declining due to poaching for bushmeat, human encroachment into protected areas and expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing.

Justin Welby had said politicians' inaction over climate change was akin to genocide. Justin Welby apologized for making the Nazi comparison to highlight the impact of changes in climate The Archbishop of Canterbury on Monday said he was \"unequivocally\" sorry\u00a0for suggesting that failure to stop climate change could bring about as grave a result as that of\u00a0Nazi war crimes. Justin Welby said he meant to highlight the gravity of global warming\u00a0as world leaders met in Scotland to discuss action on climate change at the COP26 summit. He was wrong to draw a comparison with Nazi atrocities, he added. The Holocaust came close to wiping out the entire Jewish population in Europe. Before the Nazi takeover of power in 1933, Europe had a vibrant, established, and diverse Jewish culture. By 1945, most European Jews \u2014 two out of every three \u2014 had been killed. Welby told the BBC that world leaders would be \"cursed\" if they didn't urgently find ways to reverse climate change. Justin Welby, the most senior cleric in the Church of England, told the BBC that politicians who failed to find solutions to climate change would go down \"in far stronger terms than we speak today of the politicians of the (19)30s, of the politicians who ignored what was happening in Nazi Germany.\" Welby said that was because climate change \"will kill people all around the world for generations\" and that it would \"allow a genocide of an infinitely greater scale.\" Climate change would come \"back to us or to our children and grandchildren,\" Welby added. Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle newspaper, reacted furiously to comparisons drawn with Nazi war crimes. \"If this is as reported it is so sickening that I simply cannot comprehend how Welby can remain as a priest, let alone Archbishop,\" Pollar tweeted. Welby, a former oil executive, then apologized for having made the comparison, saying that he\u2002\"unequivocally\"\u2002apologized for the words he used when trying to emphasize the gravity of climate change. \"I'm sorry for the offence caused to Jews by these words,\" he added.

The sea rose only 28 centimeters (11 inches) between 1940 and 2007, which is in keeping with recordings from the previous century.

Planning for the unknown Besides alerting the population, the agency for coastal defense has been strengthening its fortifications with so-called \"climate dikes.\" A far cry from the early hand-built clay incarnations that began appearing on the flat northern German landscape around a millennium ago, these precision-engineered giant green slopes are designed to keep the waves at bay\u00a0in such a way that it would be easy to add a new layer on top if water levels were to suddenly rise much faster than current forecasts suggest. \"We have to look to the future,\" Langmaack said. \"What we have is rising temperatures, and that means rising sea levels, but nobody can tell us how the curve is going to develop, and that makes it very difficult.\" \"We're genuinely planning for the next 100 years,\" he continued. Jannes Fr\u00f6hlich would like to experiment with returning parts of unfarmed, uninhabited land to the sea Jannes Fr\u00f6hlich of WWF Deutschland would like to see Germany, where possible, meet the predicted sea level rise with a controversial practice known as 'managed realignment'\u00a0under which sections of dike are removed to allow areas of land to be returned to the sea. Conservationists, planners, trade, industry and tourism representatives in the North Frisian harbor town of Husum devised such a scheme \u00a0in 2014. But it was ultimately knocked back by residents. \"The question is how much a society is willing to give back? And that will always involve a process of negotiation,\" Fr\u00f6hlich told DW. \"But there are no noteworthy examples because societal acceptance is too low, or because the majority of the coastal population would prefer to leave things as they are.\" A drowning sea?

Read more :\u00a0 Germany's farmers feel the heat of climate change Formed over hundreds of years by storm tides and the continual, natural depositing of marine sediment, it is the world's largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats. Laid bare twice a day by low tide, they are rich in easily accessible marine biomass that serves as essential fuel for the millions of migratory birds that stop there annually. In addition, the salt marshes between the sea and the dikes don't only offer a nesting place for several species of breeding birds, but are home to more than 1,500 species of invertebrates, 350 of which are endemic. Millions of migratory birds come to feed from the rich biomass contained in the top layer of the Wadden Sea mud flats The biosphere reserve has long enjoyed conservation status, but protecting it in the face of climate change is likely to be a monumental undertaking. At\u00a0the moment, continual sediment deposits allow it to 'grow'\u00a0at the same rate as natural sea level rise. But if that\u00a0pace is suddenly speeded up by warming temperatures, the whole system will be knocked out of synch and the mud flats will remain permanently covered. The gravity of this potential scenario, from conservation, cultural and economic perspectives, has been addressed in a 2100 Strategy for the Wadden Sea, which puts forward solutions such as adding sediment to the sea to stop it from\u00a0 drowning. As a conservationist, Fr\u00f6hlich doesn't generally sanction the idea of tampering with nature, but climate change \u00a0 induced sea level rise could, he says, be grounds enough for an exception. \"I think we underestimate what's around the corner,\" he said. \"I'm worried that large parts of this area will be lost. I really am.\" And if that happens, if the Wadden Sea starts to swallow itself,\u00a0there's a very good chance the sense of calm it instills in those who live with and from it, will sink as well. At the moment, water levels in Germany's North and Baltic Seas are not rising any faster than usual, but scientists say the process is likely to speed up in the coming decades. Exactly when, and by how much, is uncertain. And that complicates the work of coastal defense authorities. Over the centuries, the hundreds of kilometers of dikes along Germany's coastline have become higher and more sophisticated. The latest incarnations are called \"climate dikes\" and are especially designed to be able to hold back higher waters brought about by warming temperatures and rising sea levels. One time-honored way populations under threat from higher sea levels have sought to secure themselves, has been to build their homes on small mounds. On the so-called Hallig islands, it is not uncommon for these embankments to be all that is left above water during a storm surge. Unlike sea-level rise, an increase in temperatures in Germany's North and Baltic Seas is already palpable. Scientists say both bodies of water are around 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than in the 1960s. This shift in conditions has had an impact on several species, including cod, which have begun to migrate north in search of the cold in which they thrive. At the other end of the scale, anchovies are increasingly making a home for themselves in the North Sea off Germany. The species is usually found in more southerly climes, but the warming temperatures are attracting them to new waters. The Wadden Sea UNESCO World Heritage Site is also at risk from the predicted sea-level rise. It serves as a resting place for millions of migratory birds traveling between the Arctic and warmer regions to the south. Because it is so rich in food, the birds stop there for several weeks at a time to build up fat and energy reserves for their onward journeys. While few plant species can survive the salty waters that regularly flood the marshes between the Wadden Sea and the dikes, the environment is alive with tiny insect species and birds that nest at ground level. If the sea level were to rise too quickly, the Wadden Sea's characteristic mud flats would no longer be exposed at low tide. That would have huge implications, not only for the birds that rely on the ecosystem for food, but for the ecosystem itself.

{"id": null, "body": "     The fight against climate change is one of the German voters' main topics of concern. With a few days until the election, DW takes a look at what the main German political parties plan to do about it. The coal phaseout is one of the measures all parties agree on \u2014 apart from one In a year of devastating floods, record heat waves, and the Constitutional Court's calling the government's climate policy \"insufficient\" \u2014 there is no doubt climate protection is a vital issue for German voters.\u00a0 But, despite almost all parties' putting climate protection at the center of their election programs , the bottom line remains: The Paris climate target will probably not really be achieved with any of the current programs. This is the result of a study by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). The researchers conclude: \"The differences between the parties are clear. However, none of the programs delivers coherent concepts for fully achieving the 2030 targets set in the new climate protection law.\" Solar panels on the roofs of all houses is what most German politicians would like to see The center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), who have led governments under Chancellor Angela Merkel for the last 16 years, along with their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), are committed to the target of climate neutrality by 2045 and want to greatly expand renewable energies. This includes simpler programs for photovoltaics on roofs. In the economy, the CDU and CSU are focusing on climate-neutral hydrogen to replace coal in industry. Exactly how this can be achieved, however, is disputed by many economic experts.\u00a0 For the time being, the CDU/CSU is also sticking to its decision to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2038, which many environmental experts consider far too late. Chancellor candidate Armin Laschet has stuck firmly to this date, while Friedrich Merz, the former head of the CDU parliamentary group, recently stated that he could imagine an earlier date. The CDU/CSU's plans fall short of achieving the international climate target. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who have been the junior coalition partner in government for the last eight years, want Germany's electricity to come entirely from renewable energies as early as 2040. This would be achieved, among other things, by installing solar panels on all suitable roofs. The SPD is also backing hydrogen; by 2030, Germany is to become the \"lead market\" in this area. But if hydrogen is to be climate-neutral, it must be produced using renewable energies. The SPD wants rail travel to become more attractive than flying, as well as to promote electric cars and the infrastructure for them \u2014 but the party does not have plans to ban flights. The party is in favor of a speed limit of 130 kph (80 mph) on German highways. And for the time being, it is sticking to the coal phaseout by 2038, even if its candidate for chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has suggested an earlier date, such as 2034, in TV discussions. But that is not yet confirmed. Climate protection is the core of the brand for\u00a0 the Greens , and this is reflected in their program. During the election campaign, the party made headlines with its demand for a future climate protection ministry with the right to veto laws that contradict the Paris Agreement. When it comes to the 2030 target, the Greens are in favor of reducing 70% of emissions, making them more ambitious than the current government. And the Greens want to phase coal out by 2030, as well as to make short-haul flights superfluous through better rail services by 2030. The Greens want to invest \u20ac100 billion ($117 billion) in rail by 2035. And, of course, they want to massively expand renewable energies. For the pro-free market Free Democrats (FDP) , the free-market instrument of emissions trading is at the heart of climate protection policy. In EU emissions trading, around 11,000 companies in the electricity industry, large industrial plants, and airlines buy and sell pollution rights. Those who are more environmentally friendly earn money \u2014 and those who don't have to pay. The FDP wants to extend this system to all sectors. They reject driving bans and speed limits. The new government goal of being climate-neutral by 2045 is not explicitly mentioned in the program.\u00a0 The Left has the most ambitious climate targets on paper of any party currently in the Bundestag. Under their plans, Germany would be climate-neutral by 2035, and emissions should fall by a whopping 80% by 2030. The Left Party does not believe that emissions trading, which is favored by the FDP, is a good way to protect the climate; they want clear rules for the economy. The Left also wants to nationalize large energy companies. However, they are alone among the main parties in making this demand. German activists are campaigning for an end to coal powered plants before 2038 For the far-right\u00a0populists of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) , climate protection is becoming an increasingly important issue \u2014 in that they firmly reject active climate protection. The party does not believe that climate change is caused by humans and their emissions. Consequently, the AfD has no regard for the fight to reduce emissions. It wants to keep coal-fired power and demands that Germany withdraw from the Paris Agreement. And it is against doing away with gasoline and diesel engines in the long term. The closest the AfD's come to addressing climate protection could be the party's wish for Germany to be able to adapt to \"natural\" climate change, primarily through better disaster preparedness.

{"id": null, "body": "     The world has seen an \"extraordinary increase\" in energy demand last year, driving energy-related emissions to a new record. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that \"urgent action is needed on all fronts.\" Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the production of energy\u00a0reached a new\u00a0record in 2018, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report on Tuesday. CO2 emissions are the main driving force behind global warming, which scientists fear could spiral out of control unless drastic action is taken to reduce global emissions. The IEA's key findings: Read more:  CO2 emissions projected to hit historic highs in 2018 Coal in Asia is undermining Paris \"Despite the major growth in renewables, global emissions are still rising, demonstrating once again that more urgent action is needed on all fronts,\" IEA executive director Fatih Birol said. In the 2015 Paris accord , nearly every country pledged to work together to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial levels. \"Whilst not impossible, if we do not address the emissions of coal power plants in Asia, to comply with our climate goals will be extremely challenging,\" IEA's Fatih Birol told the AFP news agency. Hot future: The world is already 1 degree Celsius warmer that it was before\u00a0industrialization and temperatures are currently predicted to rise by 4 degrees. What needs to be done? Experts at the UN have\u00a0warned that global CO2 emissions would need to drop by half before 2030 to avoid catastrophic climate change. Only a complete overhaul of the global economy and consumer habits would achieve this, according to the global body. Danger hidden in permafrost : Many scientists fear a domino effect if temperatures keep climbing.\u00a0 Arctic permafrost would start melting, leading to a vicious circle as large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane \u00a0would be\u00a0released that in turn increase the rate of\u00a0global warming. dj/amp (Reuters, AFP) Every day, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

{"id": null, "body": "     After reportedly testy meetings in Alaska, the official Xinhua news agency said China and the US will cooperate on tackling climate change. China leads the world in wind energy. The Alaska talks left the US and China divided on many issues Despite media reports that little progress was made during the two-days of dialogue in the Alaskan city of Anchorage , which ended Friday, China's official\u00a0Xinhua news agency said Beijing and Washington had decided to set up a working group on climate change. The agency\u00a0did not provide any details on the initiative, other than saying both China and the United States are committed to enhancing communication and cooperation. The talks were the first face-to-face meeting between senior US officials and their Chinese counterparts since President Joe Biden took office earlier this year. They opened with tense and extended exchanges over human rights in front of\u00a0television cameras, before the officials retreated behind closed doors.  As the rivalry between the two nations escalates, the climate crisis is seen as one area that might force Beijing and Washington to join forces. The new Biden administration has promised to elevate climate issues. Meanwhile, China is already working on climate-related initiatives considered to be\u00a0\u00a0 much more advanced than the ones in the US. China is now the world leader in installed wind energy Last year, China pledged to reach climate neutrality by 2060. This will require $6.4 trillion (\u20ac5.4 trillion) of investment in new power generating capacity, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said Thursday. The switch could lead to a tectonic shift in manufacturing and commodity imports while boosting the nation's\u00a0energy security. Last year, China become the world's dominant power when it comes to wind energy after record installations . According to a report released by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), a Belgium-based international trade association, China broke the world record for most wind power capacity installed in a single year in 2020, with 52 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity \u2014 doubling the country's annual installations compared to the previous year. \"The incredible and rapid growth of wind power in the region has been led by China, which now has more wind power capacity than Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America combined,\u201d Feng Zhao, head of market intelligence and strategy at the GWEC, was quoted by the London-based Financial Times newspaper . The delegations of China and the US\u00a0also talked about \u00a0economy and trade, law enforcement, culture and people-to-people interactions, cyber-security, the Iranian nuclear issue, Afghanistan, and Myanmar, Chinese officials\u00a0said. Additionally, negotiators discussed reciprocal arrangements for the COVID-19 vaccination of each side's diplomats and consular officials. The US also reiterated its adherence to the one-China policy on the Taiwan question, according to the Chinese delegation. mb/dj (AP, Reuters) \n \u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "China, US to set up joint working group on climate change \u2014 report", "article_name": "china-us-to-set-up-joint-working-group-on-climate-change-report", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/china-us-to-set-up-joint-working-group-on-climate-change-report/a-56939667", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 3067, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:23.099993"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Political efforts to cool climate change are \"fading\" as things get worse, Antonio Guterres warned. He's visiting New Zealand en route to South Pacific islands that are at risk of being inundated by rising sea levels. Arriving in Auckland Sunday, Guterres said the world was \"not on track\" to confine the rise in global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as agreed in the 2015 Paris agreement. \"The paradox is that as things are getting worse on the ground, political will seems to be fading,\" said the UN secretary general. \"Climate change is running faster than what we are \u2026 the last four years have been the hottest registered,\" he said, adding that political inadequacy was evident \"everywhere.\" Read more : Cities push for action, Swiss included He commended host Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on New Zealand's ambitious parliamentary bill , tabled last week, seeking to make the 5-million-population nation mostly carbon neutral by 2050. Its key farming sector, however, is to be given some leeway, specifically on\u00a0\"biogenetic methane,\" another climate-warming gas alongside carbon dioxide. Guterres, who will also visit the South Pacific island territories of Fiji, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, urged the world community to \"protect the lives of our people, and we need to protect our planet.\" Guterres met with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in Auckland His remarks precede a Climate Action Summit he plans to convene in New York in September where nations will be asked to present \"concrete, realistic plans\" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% over the next decade and reach net zero by 2050. On Friday, Luis Alfonso de Alba, the top UN envoy entrusted with preparing September's summit, called for a \"drastic\" rethink of the global economic model. Required was a \"transformation of the way we consume, the way we produce,\" de Alba said. \"This is not a process in which we can aim at a gradual increase of ambitions.\" Trillions of dollars in private funding would be \"indispensable,\" he added. Christchurch visit Guterres also planned to visit Christchurch on his three-day New Zealand stopover\u00a0and meet leaders of the\u00a0Muslim\u00a0community targeted on March 15 by a lone gunman who broadcast the massacre via social media. Last week, the death toll rose to 51, with the death in hospital of a Turkish citizen critically wounded during the shooting attack on two Christchurch mosques. Guterres said he would\u00a0pay tribute to Muslim courage and New Zealand solidarity during the visit, which coincides with the month of Ramadan. He praised New Zealand's parliament for tightening gun control laws and Ardern's determination to prevent extremist acts being broadcast online. She and French President Emmanuel Macron are to host a meeting on the matter in Paris on Wednesday. Of the 2 million-odd people who visit the Great Barrier Reef annually, a 2016 survey found that 69 percent were coming to see the UNESCO World Heritage site \"before it's too late.\" And no wonder. The IPCC says that even if we manage to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, 99 percent of the world's coral will be wiped out. Tourists can hasten their demise by touching or polluting reefs. And what's the carbon cost of flying to remote natural wonders under threat? A 2010 study found that the business of polar-bear safaris in Churchill, Canada, had an annual CO2 footprint of 20 megatons. Most visitors arrived by plane, and while 88 percent of them said humans were responsible for climate change, only 69 percent agreed that air travel was a contributing cause. Along with the polar bear, one of the most iconic images of climate change must be the dramatic curves of an iceberg sculpted by the warming atmosphere. Gliding between the melting giants on a cruise ship is a haunting experience that tourists will pay huge sums for. In the early 1990s just 5,000 people visited Antarctica each year, compared to over 46,000 in 2018. You don't have to go to the poles to see vanishing ice. Kilimanjaro's snowy peaks are a striking sight above the equatorial savannah of the national park, which generates \u20ac44 million ($50 million) from tourism annually. Many visitors climb to the Furtw\u00e4ngler Glacier \u2014 where 85 percent of the ice has vanished over the last century. The rest is unlikely to survive much beyond mid-century. When Montana's Glacier National Park opened in 1910, it boasted over 100 of the ice features from which it took its name. Now, there are fewer than two dozen. So dramatic is their retreat, that the park has become a center of climate science research. Some 3 million hikers and holidaymakers also visit the \"crown of the continent\" each year, soaking in the dying days of its ice-capped glory. The Maldives are the archetypal tourist paradise: 1,200 coral islands with white beaches rising just 2.5 meters above the turquoise waters. In 2017, the president decided to build new airports and megaresorts to accommodate seven times as many tourists, and use the revenue to build new islands and relocate communities. He has since been voted out of office and faces corruption charges. It's not just islands that are going under as sea levels rise. Wetlands like Florida's Everglades are disappearing too. Over the last century, around half the Everglades have been drained and turned over to agriculture. Now, saltwater is seeping into what's left, making it the only critically endangered World Heritage site in the United States. The Galapagos will be forever associated with Darwin, who realized their unique wildlife had evolved over countless generations in isolation. Today, they are besieged by visitors and environmental changes are happening too fast for species to adapt. Ocean warming has left iconic creatures like the marine iguana starving, while UNESCO lists tourism among the greatest threats to the archipelago.

{"id": null, "body": "     Never before has a year seen such intense discussion about climate change. Unfortunately, most of the time people were talking past one another rather than with \u2014 and that has to change, says Henrik B\u00f6hme. The whole situation is intractable. Adversaries have locked horns and it is impossible to have a civilized debate. You are either for or against, right or wrong, good or evil. There is no room for anything in between. There is simply no time to talk, the end is nigh. Now is the time for action, not words. Alarm bells are ringing everywhere. There is no doubt, the climate is important : This is about melting glaciers, withering landscapes, rising sea levels and starving polar bears. What always gets left out, however, are the steps already being taken to make sure less CO2 is released into the atmosphere. The things that make factories cleaner, lower automobile\u00a0emissions or even cut them altogether by going electric. In most cases, such measures are brushed off by critics as \"greenwashing.\" Walking or cycling from A to B is one the easiest ways to reduce your carbon footprint \u2014 while also giving your own health a boost! And cutting back on flying to save emissions doesn't mean you have to forgo your annual holiday either. Simply hop on the train to your next destination, pack up the caravan for a road trip or even opt for a carbon-offset adventure! Being more conscious about what you buy (and what you don't) can go a long way toward helping our planet. Luckily, it's easier than ever to buy environmentally friendly products. Use your power as a consumer to support eco-conscious brands, shop second-hand when possible and just try to buy less \"stuff\" overall. It helps to always ask yourself if you really need something before buying it. Did you know almost a third of all food produced every year is lost or wasted? You can help reduce this figure by wasting as little of your own food as possible: Eat the leftovers, get creative with any extra ingredients and start a compost pile in your backyard with remaining scraps. Compost also makes a great fertilizer, so you won't have to buy any harmful chemical alternatives! While we're more connected than ever before, the simple act of remembering to turn off the lights, PCs, laptops and screens when you don't need them can save a huge amount of energy in the long-run. Keep it up and pretty soon you'll develop an easy habit that's also great for our planet! If you haven't already, this is the year to lend your voice to the growing movement for global climate action. And that doesn't have to mean protesting on the streets: Push your local politicians to act on climate change. Stay informed and talk to your friends, colleagues and neighbors about what they can do to help the planet. Don't underestimate the power of speaking up. We could probably all be a bit healthier when it comes to our diet choices. But switching to a more plant-based diet can also help fight climate change. Farming animals for meat and dairy is one of the biggest causes of deforestation and is a major source of CO2 emissions. Eating more plant-based foods can lower your individual impact on the environment. There's a reason we're reminded of the importance of recycling time and time again. The devastating consequences of plastic pollution is becoming increasingly obvious \u2014 especially in our oceans. Recycling means fewer new materials will need to be made. You can even upcycle if you're feeling particularly resourceful. Why not turn an old bottle into a lamp, or even a bird feeder? This year, make more of an effort to get out of the house and explore the most beautiful landscapes our Earth has to offer. It might not have a direct impact on climate action, but it's a great way to truly appreciate our planet \u2014 and remind us what we need to protect.  Author: Ineke Mules What's already happening? Here are a couple of randomly chosen examples of steps already being taken: 10 years ago, the German steel manufacturer Salzgitter started something it called its EnergyEfficiency project. Since then, it has saved a million tons of CO2, as well as consuming 3,300 Terajoule less energy each year \u2014\u00a0enough to power some 55,000 households. Another example is Washington State Ferries, the world's second-largest ferry operator. The company is currently in the process of converting its fleet \u2014\u00a0which had consumed some 75 million liters (20 million gallons) of diesel fuel annually \u2014\u00a0to battery power. But why? Because Governor Jay Inslee signed a law mandating it. But the head of the company has also said the change isn't just about conforming to the new law. He says it's a good idea, adding that you don't have to be an environmental activist to appreciate the fact that it means quieter boats, less pollution and more financial savings. More and more companies are going green Just recently, during the latest COP25 global climate conference in Madrid, some 180 companies also committed themselves to ambitious environmental goals, pledging to cut emissions continuously with the aim of being carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest. After lengthy talks, a government-appointed commission announces Germany plans to stop producing energy from coal-fired plants by 2038. Climate campaigners say it's too little, too late. Germany currently generates nearly 40% of its electricity from coal and has failed to meet targets set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The anticipated phaseout cost: \u20ac40 billion ($44 billion). After a five-year study, scientists warn two-thirds of glaciers in the Hindu-Kush-Himalayan region could melt by 2100 if global carbon emissions are not cut. Meltwater from the area, home to Mount Everest, feeds into 10 of the world's most important river systems. Water shortages would cripple food and energy production in eight countries, directly or indirectly affecting nearly 2 billion people. \"One of the deadliest storms on record in the Southern Hemisphere\" \u2014 according to the UN \u2014 hits low-lying Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, killing nearly 1,000 people and causing widespread damage. Vast swaths of farmland are flooded, bringing disease and food shortages. Six weeks later, another cyclone strikes. Some 62 million people were affected by extreme weather in 2018, says the WMO. Extinction Rebellion causes more than a week of travel chaos in London with disruptive, colorful protests across the British capital. In the UK and around the world, the activist group's rallies make headlines throughout the year as they promote radical political, economic and social change to avert the worst effects of global warming. Critics call their plans to abandon fossil fuels unrealistic. At the EU elections, voter turnout is up \u2014 and populist and environmentalist parties make big gains. European Green parties win 74 seats in the 751-member European Parliament. The German Greens take more than 20% of the vote, their best-ever results. Frans Timmermans is chosen as the European Commission's new climate chief, with the bloc aiming to cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Thousands of protesters descend on Garzweiler, one of Germany's biggest open-pit coal mines near Cologne, protesting plans to expand at the expense of nearby old-growth forest. Meanwhile, an estimated 40,000 people from across Europe march through Aachen to campaign for more climate action. Over the Channel, the UK parliament becomes the first in the world to declare a symbolic climate emergency. Much of Europe suffers through an intense heat wave, with temperatures breaking 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) across the continent \u2014 smashing records set just weeks earlier. People are advised to limit time spent outdoors, while travelers face delays due to speed restrictions on superheated railway tracks. Climate monitoring agencies report July as the hottest month on record. The number of forest fires in the Amazon surges to its highest point since 2010, and thousands of firefighters are deployed to put out the blaze. President Jair Bolsonaro blasts a global outcry that not enough is being done to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest, insisting on Brazil's sovereign right. Previously, he blamed rainforest protections for hindering economic development. Teen activist Greta Thunberg, who inspired Fridays for Future protests worldwide, blasts world leaders at the United Nations for \"failing to act\" on the climate crisis. \"Change is coming, whether you like it or not.\" As millions of young people join marches around the world, leaders from more than 70 countries commit to carbon neutrality by 2050 \u2014 but not China, Russia, India, Japan or China. Local groups, cities and young people around the world increasingly take their climate concerns to court in 2019. Just this month: a group of 15 youths (above) sues the Canadian government for violating their fundamental rights with policies that fail to curb CO2 emissions. Over in Germany, a court rejects a lawsuit by three farming families against Berlin's failed climate mitigation efforts. Venice is hit by exceptional floods, with water levels topping 1.5 meters (nearly 5 feet) three times in one week \u2014 the worst flooding since records began in 1872. Famed monuments and museums, including St. Mark's Basilica and the crypt, are inundated. Undeterred tourists, however, continue to snap selfies. Meanwhile, Oxford English Dictionary names \"climate emergency\" its word of the year. As world leaders meet in Madrid for the COP25 climate conference, the head of the UN says the world is rapidly approaching the \"point of no return.\" An EU report says the environmental situation has worsened, with the bloc likely to miss 2030 carbon reduction targets. Reacting to climate concerns, the European Parliament declares a \"climate emergency\" and the EU Commission lays out its Green Deal. Author: Martin Kuebler And these aren't small, niche companies, but rather big global corporations like the consumer goods producer Beiersdorf; the world's largest beer producer, Ambev; and the International Airline Group, Europe's third-largest airline holding company (British Airways and Iberia). Such commitments have practically doubled the number of companies now in the \"Business Ambition for 1.5\u02daC: Our Only Future\" alliance since it was founded in September of last year. Admittedly, other things are also happening, things that bewilder activists and realists alike. One need only look to the disaster that is the German energy transition. True, the percentage of energy produced by renewables has gone up, but \u2014\u00a0according to the Federal Audit Office \u2013\u2014some \u20ac160 billion ($179 billion) has also devoured in the process. Despite such efforts, the German solar industry is practically nonexistent and things don't look much better for the wind industry. In Germany, people prefer to argue about minimum distances between wind turbines and the next closest village, while our French neighbors negotiate the construction of six new nuclear power plants. Read more:  Germany shuts down atomic plant as nuclear phase-out enters final stretch What climate activists really want Either way: Is it \u2014\u00a0as climate activists ceaselessly tell us \u2014\u00a0true that nothing is really happening? Or have the topics of sustainability and environmental compatibility finally struck a note with companies? And if the latter, is it because they provide a good sales strategy? And what would be wrong with that if it did? Might it not also make sense to look closer at just what climate activists want? Take Luisa Neubauer, for instance, known here as the German Greta Thunberg , despite being a few years older than the Swedish teen; or Carola Rackete, who is internationally known as the refugee-saving captain of the ship Sea Watch 3, but would prefer to be part of the Extinction Rebellion movement. Both women have now written books: Rackete called hers\u00a0\"Act: A Call to the Last Generation,\" and Neubauer\u00a0titled hers\u00a0\"The End of the Climate Crisis.\" Both books go straight to the heart of the matter \u2014\u00a0they are full of ideas for bans and penalties. The authors call for those who destroy nature to be tried for crimes against humanity. Yet, neither wastes words defending individual rights, arguing that individuals cannot be trusted to decide whether they are for or against climate protection. DW's Henrik B\u00f6hme In interviews given after her book was published, Carola Rackete went further still: \"Everything we do, or don't do, props up the current system.\" That's why civil disobedience is so \"extremely urgent.\" It quickly becomes clear that what these women are after is something much bigger than climate protection: They are at war with the existing economic system, with free-market economies, and with capitalism. And anyone who is opposed to that fight, or is of a different opinion, simply cannot be right. Only those who are for radical climate protection are among the good, and only they own the truth. But anyone who so vehemently clamors for an environmental planned economy should take a quick look into the recent past. It would seem that the disastrous state of the environment in former East Germany would be enough to illustrate just how ineffective planned systems are when it comes to sustainability and climate protection. So what now? In such a heated environment \u2014\u00a0sorry for the pun \u2014\u00a0it seems there is no chance of having a rational debate. But we have to talk about how we are going to tackle this challenge, and it is becoming increasingly clear that the discussion has to take place between different generations \u2014\u00a0one that has experienced life, and another that is impatient. But apocalyptic scenarios prophesying the end of the world won't lead anywhere. At the most, they will simply harden opposition among those of a different opinion. That would be a shame, because we need the ideas that young people have to offer. We need their youthful nonchalance, their openness and their curiosity. The young need to show us that they can do things better than us \u2014\u00a0but they should also let us come along on the journey, at least for a while.\u00a0\u00a0 The German chancellor struck an encouraging tone in what is likely to be one of her last New Year's addresses.

{"id": null, "body": "     Indigenous groups in the US state of Alaska, also referred to as Alaska Natives, have already seen climate change disrupt their subsistence way of life. But they are trying to adapt. Teresa Hunter lives in Chuathbaluk, a Yup'ik village in the southwest of Alaska. The name means \"The Great Blueberry.\" Chuathbulak is a tiny village of less than 100 people that exists off the road system. The only way to get there is by boat or plane in the summer, and by plane or driving on frozen rivers and the tundra during the winter.\u00a0 Like many rural Alaska Native communities, Chuathbulak doesn't have a hospital, and its two grocery stores mostly stock food that doesn't spoil because it has to be flown in. Fresh produce, like oranges or lettuce, is a rare treat. And food there typically costs four times as much as in the Lower 48 \u2014 which is what Alaskans call the rest of the US states except for Hawaii. Read more: \u00a0 Forest fires in Alaska: A ticking climate time bomb Though some in the local population have swapped the traditional sod houses and dog teams for frame homes, snowmobiles, motorboats and all-terrain vehicles in recent decades, most still\u00a0fish, hunt and forage for their food. Just as\u00a0their ancestors did. Hunter is among them, and says\u00a0the traditional way of life also helps keep her grocery bills low.\u00a0But she is starting to notice climate change impacting a well-practiced routine. Summers are hotter, and winters are getting warmer.\u00a0 Teresa Hunter has lived in time with nature for many years The tiny village of Chuathbulak overlooking the Kuskokwim River Hunter said in past years, the salmon would come up first through the Kuskokwim River in June and the berries would be ready for picking in August. But now the berries are ripening earlier, overlapping with the fishing season. That means people have to fish and harvest fruit at the same time in order to store enough food for the winter. \"It's a little difficult to do both at once,\" Hunter told DW.\u00a0\"[You have to] worry about your fish and then [have to] think of your berries.\" Elders predicted climate change This summer's heat wave was another sign of climate change. It sent temperatures up to 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in early July \u2014 a first in places such as Alaska's biggest city, Anchorage.\u00a0 When Enakenty Sallison, who lives in Bethel, one of western Alaska's\u00a0hub towns, went fishing during the spell of intense heat, he found dead salmon.\u00a0 \"I didn't know why they were dying until I read this article saying the heat wave was what was killing them,\"\u00a0Sallison said. Following media reports of further sightings in a tributary of the Yukon River, north of Bethel, biologists from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the University of Alaska Fairbanks\u00a0began to research the die-off.\u00a0 But some in western Alaska say climate change is not a surprise. Many have heard the elders passing down stories about climate change and how to prepare for it.\u00a0 Hunter remembers an elder coming to her school when she was a teenager and saying \"down states weather\" would come up here to Alaska. \"I wonder how he [knew] this stuff even though he couldn't read,\" she said.\u00a0\"Sure enough, we're having the weather that he's talking about.\" She worries that the changing weather will make it harder for her grandchildren to fish and hunt, and that it will become even more challenging to travel in the winter as the ice freezes later and is no longer as thick.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0 Alaska's sea ice loss means boom in polar bear tourism Search and rescue groups, usually made up of volunteers from local villages, are already seeing the consequences of higher temperatures \u2014 2016 was the warmest winter on record for Alaska, and 2018 the second warmest.\u00a0 This year, four people died in the southwest of Alaska driving their snow machines into open water or falling through thin ice. Bethel Search and Rescue volunteer Mark Leary recovered some of the bodies. \"People are, they have to, [push] the envelope of safety so that they can start traveling by their own means,\" Leary said.\u00a0 He says airports are becoming ever more crowded as people turn to planes to get to bigger hubs, like Bethel, where they can find medical help or shop for groceries not available in the village stores.\u00a0 Thinning ice, shifting communities Erosion is another big challenge in western Alaska, where most communities have been established near a river or on the Bering Sea coast, close to their main food source. Though erosion isn't new, as the ocean warms the sea ice that acts as coastal protection is weakening. And that means the shoreline is creeping closer to established villages. The thawing permafrost also destabilizes the ground beneath homes.

The new location, called Mertarvik, is on Nelson Island, on higher ground and is built upon solid bedrock. Boat and plane are the only means of accessing some communities in this part of Alaska In places like Quinhagak, coastal erosion is forcing many to consider relocation South of Newtok, the village of Quinhagak is also facing erosion along its coastline and from the Kanektok River that runs through it. Tribal leaders are also starting to consider a move. \"I think it's time to start preparing. It's coming, there's no way about it,\" Warren Jones, one of the village's leaders and the main advocate for\u00a0moving, told DW.\u00a0\"We have to relocate to better ground.\" With the 2018 National Climate Assessment \u2014 a report drafted every four years and sent to the US Congress and president \u2014 stating that Alaska is at the front lines of climate change, and Alaska Natives poised to feel the brunt of our warming world, Jones hopes more villages will consider following Newtok's lead. In the meantime, tribal leaders in southwest Alaska have been meeting with state government officials and local organizations to draft a climate adaptation plan.\u00a0 While she waits for the outcome, Teresa Hunter plans to adapt in her own way, by bartering her berries for more salmon.\u00a0 Every day, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

{"id": null, "body": "     We can't reach the Paris Agreement climate goals without business on board. Some companies are taking action, but big polluters are lagging behind. It's a major topic at the climate talks in Bonn, Germany. It\u2019s that time of the year when climate negotiators have come together in an attempt to solve the climate crisis. This time in the German city of\u00a0Bonn\u00a0for\u00a0a round of talks\u00a0that pave\u00a0the way for\u00a0the December COP25 climate conference\u00a0in\u00a0Chile.\u00a0 One thing delegates are talking about is the role of business in tackling rising global temperatures. \"Climate change is everyone's business and business needs to be a part of the solution,\"\u00a0\u00a0Majda Dabaghi, director of inclusive and green growth for the International Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business organization told DW. Experts agree that the corporate sector has a vital role to play in\u00a0reaching the 1.5 C goal as called for in the\u00a0\u00a0 2018 IPCC report \u2014 and some companies\u00a0are ready to act. Swedish furniture giant, IKEA, has promised to switch to 100% renewable electricity by 2020 and the world's largest container shipping company, Maersk, has pledged to replace\u00a0fossil fuels with alternative sources such as biofuels in order to achieve\u00a0 net zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u00a0 Climate change, everyone's business For companies that are serious about their contribution to fighting climate change, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), \u00a0offers guidelines that help them assess their carbon footprint, and evaluate whether their commitments are in line with a below 2 C or a 1.5 C scenario.\u00a0 Established in 2014 by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and a number of other organizations, the SBTi has already approved the targets for 220 companies. More than 300 more have committed to setting goals. \u00a0 This isn't only good for the planet, says Yamide Dagnet, head of climate negotiations projects at the WRI, but for the companies themselves. \"By engaging in\u00a0reducing your carbon footprint, especially when you look at energy efficiency, you're going to save money that you can reinvest\u00a0in innovation for instance, or marketing,\" Dagnet told DW.\u00a0 The business sector can also help fill the green financing gap, because as Dabaghi explained, \"governments can't fund all of the investments that need to be made in order for us to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.\" But they can, and must, she added, implement policies to lower the risk of investing in sustainable development, and in so doing, incentivize business. Dagnet believes cooperation between business and governments is key for climate action Dagnet\u00a0talks in terms of ambition loops, in which companies should be encouraging countries to increase their climate action and vice versa.\u00a0 Also known as positive feedback loops, they describe a scenario in which companies can increase green investment and set ambitious climate targets to signal their support of\u00a0bolder government\u00a0policy. Governments, in turn, can enable businesses to take further action through strong policies and clear timelines. Business leading the way In reality, however, Dagnet says it sometimes \"feels like the political will from the government is falling behind the vision and readiness of some companies.\"\u00a0 Of those 220 companies with targets already approved by the SBTi, 44 are Japanese \u2014 as compared to Germany's seven.\u00a0 While that implies a level of corporate commitment, Japan's climate pledges are not consistent with the 1.5 C\u00a0limit. In the 2019 Climate Change Performance Index, which assesses what 56 countries are doing to fight climate change, Japan ranked 49. That said, none of the countries assessed achieved a \"very high\" ranking. Dabaghi says the ICC is working to mobilize businesses around the world to collectively tell governments \"we need to raise ambition and we are here to support you in raising that ambition.\" Together with a broad coalition of businesses, civil society and UN leaders, the ICC has signed\u00a0 an open letter \u00a0for the private sector to increase its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global temperatures from soaring. Fossil fuel companies: a tough nut Though hundreds of companies around the world are already working to reduce their carbon footprints by moving to renewables, cutting back on waste or supporting sustainably-grown products, not every sector is moving at the same pace.\u00a0 Activists have long accused big oil and gas companies of making little or no effort to clean up their operations. Citing recent research , Sriram Madhusoodanan, deputy campaigns director for NGO Corporate Accountability, says some major fossil fuel corporations such as Shell and Exxon have invested over a billion dollars on misleading climate-related branding and lobbying. \"We're certainly seeing a lot of talk,\" he told DW. \"You could even say greenwashing.\" Madhusoodanan fights against the lobby of the fossil fuel industry Dagnet agrees that convincing fossil fuel companies to align with a 1.5\u00a0degree target\u00a0will not be an easy exercise. That said, she regards having the conversation as progress. \"We believe in the power of supply chain,\" she said. \"If companies like Shell have clients that demand them to do things differently, they'll have to react and adapt.\" But that's not enough for Madhusoodanan, who says oil and gas companies have known climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels \"for decades longer\" than he has been alive.\u00a0\u00a0 They are also the ones, he says, who \"have actively fueled and intensified the crisis both through their operations as well as through their obstruction of meaningful climate policy at the UNFCCC and at a national level.\" Dabaghi, however, believes everyone should have a say in the climate talks, including high emitting sectors.\u00a0 \"An inclusive and constructive dialogue will only help to accelerate climate action,\" she said. Extinction Rebellion, started last year by British academics, ended 11 days of massive disruptions in London by targeting the financial district known as the City. Activists, who are calling for zero emissions by 2025, say investors and traders in the district are making huge profits at the environment's expense. Protesters glued themselves to one another and to the entrance of the London Stock Exchange Thursday. A statement released by the group read: \"Many of the most environmentally destructive companies in the world have their stock market listings at the London Stock Exchange (LSE). This institution literally trades in the destruction of our planet.\" Protesters are demanding the British government recognize the dire state of the environment and declare a climate and ecological emergency to prevent the further extinction of life forms and environmental degradation. They are also calling for the creation of a public citizen's assembly to address solutions to climate change. The use of fossil fuels is widely seen as one of the biggest contributors to global warming, resulting in rising sea levels, violent weather, forced migration, death and destruction. Still, the world's biggest banks have invested some \u20ac1.75 trillion ($1.95 trillion) in fossil fuels since the Paris Climate Agreement was adopted three years ago. Police arrested 1,130 people over the course of the protests, 69 will face criminal charges. Protesters engaged in non-violent acts of civil disobedience such as gluing themselves to buildings, buses, trains, one another, and the street. One protester said: \"Some people don't like our methods, but do like our message. What we say is: We're not here to be liked. We're here to get attention.\" Retired parole officer Phil Kingston celebrated his 83rd birthday by climbing atop a train at Canary Wharf during rush hour.

{"id": null, "body": "     Global warming, a weakening jet stream and the moon will combine to cause more devastating heat waves and floods in the coming decades. Experts predict floods will become more frequent in Germany Over 100 people are dead and many more are reported missing after deadly floods swept large parts of western Germany this week. The shock is huge, with people losing friends, relatives, and homes. Such devastating floods have\u00a0not been seen in decades. Meteorologists warn, however, that extreme weather events are likely to become much more familiar in future. Floods have swept northern Europe this week \"Extreme rainfall is going to become more frequent in a warmer world,\" Andreas Fink from the Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology told DW. One reason for this is that global warming is causing the atmosphere to change, said Dr. Sebastian Sippel from the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science in Zurich told DW: \"For every increase in temperature of one degree Celsius, the atmosphere can absorb about 7% more moisture. [\u2026] The additional moisture caused by global warming will lead to higher amounts of precipitation in the long term, especially when there is heavy rainfall.\" There is no doubt that human-made climate change is heating up the atmosphere. Asked about the current floods in Germany, Dr. Carl Friedrich Schleussner from the geography department of Humboldt University in Berlin said in a statement: \"In 2021, it is not a question of whether climate change played a role but simply how much .\" There is a consensus among scientists about thermodynamic processes, the increasingly warm atmosphere and its increased capacity for moisture. However, there is another factor that some experts believe is probably contributing to extreme weather events such as the floods in Europe this week and the recent heat wave on the west coast of the US and Canada, but this has yet to be determined conclusively. It concerns the air currents, which ensure that high-pressure and low-pressure areas in Europe's temperate latitudes tend to move on quickly. Climate researchers such as Andreas Fink believe that the jet stream, a westerly wind that blows at a height of about nine kilometers around the North Pole, has lost momentum in recent years, causing waves in what used to be a steady air flow. \"These waves then stay in place and they can, depending on where they are, cause extreme heat waves such as those we have seen in North America, or cause floods\" he said, explaining that the floods caused by the recent storm Bernd\u00a0were the result of the fact that cyclones and anticyclones were not being pushed on so vigorously and meant that a storm could concentrate in one place. Heat waves and winds can combine to cause devastating fires Experts believe that the jet stream, which is fueled by the difference in temperature between the Arctic and the tropics, is buckling because temperatures are rising in the Arctic and as the difference becomes smaller the air flow is weaker. Another concern is that tides are predicted to be higher and lower than usual in the coming decade because of an irregularity of the moon's orbit. Though this occurs every 18 years, by the 2030s sea levels might have risen to such an extent that it could be disastrous. On its website, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) explains: \"In half of the Moon's 18.6-year cycle, Earth's regular daily tides are suppressed: High tides are lower than normal, and low tides are higher than normal. In the other half of the cycle, tides are amplified: High tides get higher, and low tides get lower. Global sea level rise pushes high tides in only one direction \u2014\u00a0higher. So half of the 18.6-year lunar cycle counteracts the effect of sea level rise on high tides, and the other half increases the effect.\" Researchers predict long-lasting floods with catastrophic consequences. Combined with the growing number of other extreme weather events caused by climate change, this is particularly troubling. \n At DW, we are constantly striving to improve our service to you.

{"id": null, "body": "     Catholic Church leaders from around the world have called for global agreement on climate change at upcoming talks in Paris. The appeal urged for \"complete decarbonisation\" by 2050. Catholic leaders representing the church from around the world said the international community has an ethical and moral obligation to reach a climate deal that is socially just and takes into account the poor.  \"We Cardinals, Patriarchs and Bishops have come together to express, on our own behalf and on behalf of the people for whom we care, the widely-held hope that a just and legally binding climate agreement will emerge,\" the appeal said. The appeal comes ahead of the November 30 to December 11 UN climate talks in Paris aiming to reach a global pact that would commit countries to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and limit a world temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.  The call puts the 1.2 billion-member Catholic Church squarely within the debate on global warming, after Pope Francis earlier this year issued an encyclical on the environment, Laudato Si, warning of the consequences of environmental destruction and climate change. In the unprecedented call Catholic Church leaders from Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Oceania said the global agreement \"should limit global temperature increases to avoid catastrophic climatic impacts, especially on the most vulnerable communities.\" The 10-point policy proposal calls for \"complete decarbonization\" by 2050, prioritizing \"people-driven solutions rather than profits\" and for negotiators to take into consideration \"particularly the ethical and moral dimensions\" of climate change. The latter point is a nod to not only the burden climate change will place on the poor and vulnerable, but recognizes the industrialized countries have more responsibility for climate change as well as the technology and ability to adapt. \"Those responsible for climate change have responsibilities to assist the most vulnerable in adapting and managing loss and damage and to share the necessary technology and knowhow,\" the appeal said. One of the main divides in the upcoming talks is between developed and developing countries, which argue that advanced economies should provide financial and technological support to help developing countries adapt to climate change and implement greener technologies.

{"id": null, "body": "     A new report has revealed the extent to which Germany has already been affected by climate change. Temperatures have risen markedly in the past five years, and it is expected to get worse. The average temperature in Germany rose 1.5 degrees Celsius between the years 1881 and 2018, with a 0.3 degree rise just in the last five years, a new climate change report revealed on Tuesday. \"The observations of the German Weather Service are unambiguous. It is rapidly getting warmer, more heat waves are threatening our health and everyone must expect damage from heavier rainfall. Germany is in the grip of climate change,\" said Tobias Fuchs , head of the Climate and Environmental Consulting Department of the German Weather Service (DWD).\u00a0 Fuchs was speaking at the presentation of the \"Monitoring Report on Climate Change Impacts\" in Germany. Read more: \u00a0 Is Germany too stingy to fund the fight against climate change? What the report found The report revealed, among other things, more health risks due to heat stress, an increase in the mean surface temperature of the North Sea and greater fluctuations in agricultural yields. The report found there was an increase in the number of days that are 30 degrees or\u00a0above, rising from three to 10 between 1951 and 2018. It also said there were up to 7,500 deaths in some years due the heatwaves. In the past 10 years, groundwater levels have receded, leading to problems with drinking water supplies in some communities, according to the findings. Increasing drought and increasingly frequent low water levels in rivers have impaired ecosystems, led to restricted shipping and endangered the supply of cooling water to power plants and industry. Economic toll In the past 50 years, according to the report, heat and drought caused \u20ac700 million ($771 million) in agricultural losses. Growing seasons had expanded from 222 days in 1951-1981\u00a0to 232 days in 1988-2017. Animal and plant species from warmer regions of the world also spread into the\u00a0country, including sardines and anchovies\u00a0in the North Sea and the Asian tiger mosquito on land, increasing the risk\u00a0of disease. Damage to infrastructure from extreme weather events affected the economy, with insurance losses of about \u20ac3.1 billion incurred on houses, motor vehicles, household goods, commerce, industry and agriculture in 2018.\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 Foresters fighting to save Germany's threatened woodlands Things will get worse Fuchs warned that climate change models predicted further increases in mean air temperature across Germany, between 3.1 to 4.7 degrees\u00a0by the end of the century.\u00a0 He said there would likely be a\u00a0significant increase in the occurrence of extremely high temperatures and the frequency of heat waves in the future, while frost events will probably occur less frequently. Precipitation conditions will become more extreme, Fuchs added, with an increase both in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation \u2014\u00a0but also in the frequency of dry days. Read more:\u00a0 Climate change: What Germany can learn from the Netherlands At the moment, water levels in Germany's North and Baltic Seas are not rising any faster than usual, but scientists say the process is likely to speed up in the coming decades. Exactly when, and by how much, is uncertain. And that complicates the work of coastal defense authorities. Over the centuries, the hundreds of kilometers of dikes along Germany's coastline have become higher and more sophisticated. The latest incarnations are called \"climate dikes\" and are especially designed to be able to hold back higher waters brought about by warming temperatures and rising sea levels. One time-honored way populations under threat from higher sea levels have sought to secure themselves, has been to build their homes on small mounds. On the so-called Hallig islands, it is not uncommon for these embankments to be all that is left above water during a storm surge. Unlike sea-level rise, an increase in temperatures in Germany's North and Baltic Seas is already palpable. Scientists say both bodies of water are around 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than in the 1960s. This shift in conditions has had an impact on several species, including cod, which have begun to migrate north in search of the cold in which they thrive. At the other end of the scale, anchovies are increasingly making a home for themselves in the North Sea off Germany. The species is usually found in more southerly climes, but the warming temperatures are attracting them to new waters. The Wadden Sea UNESCO World Heritage Site is also at risk from the predicted sea-level rise. It serves as a resting place for millions of migratory birds traveling between the Arctic and warmer regions to the south. Because it is so rich in food, the birds stop there for several weeks at a time to build up fat and energy reserves for their onward journeys. While few plant species can survive the salty waters that regularly flood the marshes between the Wadden Sea and the dikes, the environment is alive with tiny insect species and birds that nest at ground level. If the sea level were to rise too quickly, the Wadden Sea's characteristic mud flats would no longer be exposed at low tide. That would have huge implications, not only for the birds that rely on the ecosystem for food, but for the ecosystem itself. Author: Tamsin Walker Calls for change Federal Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said the \"alarming\" report revealed an imminent need to adapt to climate change through design and planning. \"All construction and infrastructure projects must be better equipped to withstand the adverse effects of heat, heavy rain or flooding. This also applies to the design of urban residential areas. Green roofs and building facades, water areas and shaded areas alleviate heat and improve rainwater retention. At the same time, they improve air quality.\"\u00a0 \"Such sustainable climate adaptation not only makes our infrastructure more robust;\u00a0it also safeguards Germany as a business location and adds value to our quality of life.\" Read more: \u00a0 Germany's Angela Merkel no longer leading the charge on climate change The president of the Federal Environment Agency, Maria Krautzberger, called for state investment in the monitoring and mitigation of climate change. \"The future has already reached us. Germany is in the midst of global warming, with far-reaching consequences for the environment, society and health. There is an urgent need to take precautions to counter these consequences,\" she said .\u00a0 \"Monitoring must be further improved and the consequences of climate change on the one hand and state investments on the other must be fully understood. For example, a special climate protection program\u00a0supported and financed by the federal and state governments is conceivable.\" This week, Germany and western Europe are bracing for another record-breaking week of heat. A high-pressure \"heat dome\" could send temperatures towards 40 degrees Celsius (104.5 Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, probably peaking on Thursday. The German Weather Service (DWD) issued a heat warning for the entire country for Wednesday and Thursday. The heat is expected to last until the weekend. A dried-out park in Cologne. DWD meteorologists said that temperatures on Thursday in the heavily populated areas around Cologne and the Ruhr region in western Germany could break the country's all-time heat record of 40.3 C (104 F) \u2014 set in the Bavarian village of Kitzingen in 2015. This heat wave could be \"one for the history books\" said a DWD spokesperson on Monday. The French weather service said temperatures in Paris on Thursday are forecast to reach a stifling 42 C (107 F), which would break the city's all-time heat record of 40.4 C (104.7 F) that has stood for over 70 years. The UK could also break its heat record of 38.5 C (101 F) on Thursday. Air conditioners are uncommon in Germany. Those in the north can cool off by the sea, but people living in the rest of the country will pack into public pools or wade into rivers and lakes. Residents of Munich often cool off in the Isar River, which cuts through the city. June 2019 was the hottest June ever recorded in Germany. Highways can buckle under extreme heat, as on this autobahn highway in Lower Saxony in northern Germany. These so-called \"blow ups\" happen suddenly and are very dangerous for drivers. Authorities in Germany often issue temporary speed limits on highways during heat waves in a bid to limit the risks. Cyclists are slogging through 40 C (104 F) heat during the decisive week of a thrilling Tour de France, as the race route crosses through the country's scorched southeast. Organizers set up ice foot baths and extra water stations. The pros often have no choice, but health authorities advise against outdoor exercise in extreme temperatures. Washington, New York and Boston on the the US east coast experienced record heat over the weekend. A cold front broke the heat wave on Tuesday, bringing severe thunderstorms that caused flooding and power outages in New York and New Jersey. On Cape Cod, a popular vacation destination in Massachusetts, a rare tornado ripped the roof off a hotel. Workers manufacture ice blocks at a factory in China's eastern Anhui province. A heat wave is currently gripping parts of eastern China, including Beijing, with temperatures this week ranging from 33 to 37 C (91-98 F). The heat has created a spike in demand for ice. According to the North American Atmospheric Association (NOAA), this past June was the hottest ever recorded worldwide \u2014 and NOAA predicts that July 2019 is on track to be the hottest month since records began 140 years ago. Climate scientists warn that the unprecedented heat waves seen in 2019 will be normal weather events in the future. Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

On Sunday, Uprising warned they planned to carry out disruptive protests, targeting airports and ports if the government does not commit to more legal measures aimed at preventing food waste. \u00a0 The activists are urging the German government to do more to reduce food waste Germany throws away\u00a0more food per capita than any other EU nation. \"We wish such a step were not necessary,\" Carla Hinrichs, a group spokesperson, told an online press conference, adding that if the government did not give a specific date to introduce a \"food rescue law\" in the Bundestag, the group would be forced to \"stand up for everyone's survival\" through what it described as civil resistance. Demonstrators have said they also plan to target airports, not only in Hamburg but in Berlin and Munich as well. Another group spokesperson,\u00a0Aimee van Baalen, told Deutschlandfunk radio that they had decided to move to more drastic measures after years of \"signing petitions and marching on the streets\" had done little to bring about the changes necessary \"to save humanity from environmental collapse.\" jcg, es/wd (dpa, EPD) The head of Greenpeace International, Jennifer Morgan, has become Germany's new climate envoy. Her links to Germany, and the country's environmental policies, go back more than two decades.\n\u00a0 In Germany, there's plenty of food to go around. So much in fact that every year 10 million tons of perfectly edible food end up in the bin. Now, a smart phone app wants to put an end to this food waste.\n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate change activists block Hamburg port bridge", "article_name": "climate-change-activists-block-hamburg-port-bridge", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-activists-block-hamburg-port-bridge/a-60859220", "date_published": "2022-02-21 00:00:00", "article_length": 2440, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:26.975649"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Baba Brinkman is a Canadian rapper who sings about climate change. His songs are fact-checked by experts. In an interview, he explains why he thinks rap is the perfect medium to create awareness about global warming. DW: Baba Brinkman, you're a self-proclaimed \"nerdy rapper\"\u00a0who writes \"lit-hop\"\u00a0or \"literatary hip-hop.\"\u00a0You\u00a0sing about bookish topics like\u00a0evolution and medicine. In your latest album, \"Rap Guide to Climate Chaos,\"\u00a0you are now tackling\u00a0climate change. Who is your music targeting exactly? Baba Brinkman : I'm trying to cast the net as wide as I can in terms of my audience. I'd like to reach people that don't think climate change is a problem and make them realize that it is, and that it needs to be addressed. I did this show off Broadway in New York for five months earlier this year and performed for thousands of people who came to see it. Some people came up to me after the show to say: \"I'm convinced. I came to this show thinking that there is no problem and now I realize there's a big problem.\" So that's definitely a big part of my audience. Brinkman is also a playwright, who combines hip-hop music with literature, theater, and science I think a lot of people come to the show or turn on the album assuming that they're on board. They're thinking, yes, climate change is a problem and I am dealing with it, because I take shorter showers and I take my bike to work and changed my light bulbs so that they're not incandescent. Part of the message of the album, which is counterintuitive to a lot of people on the left who think they are already on board with the solution, is that that's not good enough. That's not even going to come close to solving the problem. The only way it can be solved is via mass-scale intervention, like carbon taxes or carbon trade systems that change the entire economical infrastructure. So I'm advocating for people to be citizens more so than just consumers. Some of your songs include battle rap elements. One song for instance starts with the lyrics: \"Yo\u00a0momma's carbon footprint is so fat.\" The song is called Battle Line and it's kind of making fun of some of the contentiousness around the topic of climate change\u00a0and how it's really combative in public discourse. So I relate that to battle rap comparisons. One line goes: \"The mismatches on either side are shocking. It's like Sarah Palin against Stephen Hawking.\u201d\u00a0 Because I think their level of intellectual discourse can be pretty mismatched.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DW: Being factually correct is important to you, you even draw on experts to check your lyrics. How does that work? I've kind of created this formula over the years. Each of my records from the \"Rap Guide\u201d albums is peer-reviewed by experts in the field. So as I'm devising the lyrics, I'm reaching out to scientists and the people who really study this stuff first-hand, and I'm saying: Can you look at my lyrics, can you tell me if there's anything that misconstrues the science?\u00a0And if there is\u00a0something, then I'll change it. So I'm soliciting feedback. DW: Why do you think music is such an effective medium to talk about big issues like climate change? Baba Brinkman is not jus rapping to save our planet, he's personally planted more than one million trees I feel like there's a memorability factor. Music is designed to be catchy and to get stuck in your head and to get you singing along. There's a lot of lyrical witticism, punch lines and metaphors in there; just ways of thinking about climate change that would be counterintuitive but are designed to be memorable. That's not just my music, that's what all music is like. I think rap music specifically is a storytelling medium. And stories are more memorable than just concepts. So I feel like the tools were already there. It's just that a lot of rap music is telling certain stories, like the stories of the individual rappers - here's my neighborhood, here's where I come from, here's my aspirations, that kind of stuff. A lot of it is strictly autobiographical. And I do some of that in my album as well. I talk about my background and how that makes me interested in climate change. But I also talk about the question of how do you get to be a suburban, white, middle-class Canadian that's a hip-hop artist rapping about science for the masses? I do make it personal in that way. For me,\u00a0music is a medium for connecting with people in a way that a lecture can't.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of your songs is called \"Fossil Fuel Ballers.\"\u00a0What does that term mean? In hip hop there's this trope of a \"baller,\" somebody who ostentatiously flaunts his\u00a0wealth. And in the context of recent human history, western civilization could be said to be balling. Let's put it like this: Western civilization is a bling-heavy phenomenon. And fossil fuels are really the driver of that; it drives most of the economic growth. Global stock markets are still hugely tied to the oil price. I'm an example of a fossil fuel baller, but so are you if your financial stability comes from the benefits of burning fossil fuels. Which is the case for most people, because 80 percent of the global economy is driven by fossil fuels right now.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where are you drawing your inspiration from? Mori and Mila are determined to save Hambacher Forst, an ancient forest in Germany, which is facing the chop. German power company RWE wants to expand the country's largest brown coal mine. To keep the diggers away, Mori and Mila have moved into treehouses. Some activists even regularly sneak into the open-pit coal mine where they lock themselves to mining excavators to stop operations. Where others see trash, Marius Smit sees a valuable resource. Amsterdam's canals are littered with discarded plastic bottles - until Marius and his volunteers have passed by. They enjoy a drink, while casting their nets and pulling in a haul that Marius\u2019s company \"Plastic Whale\" turns into boats. That way, the bottles make their way back onto the canals - but in a much more attractive form. Luana Carretto believes we've lost touch with food and can't tell if something wrapped in plastic is still good to eat. As a result, we throw away perfectly edible food without a second thought. That's why she set up \"Taste Before You Waste\" in Amsterdam, delivering food otherwise headed for the trash to those in need. She hands out \"waste\" food to strangers and cooks up delicious community meals. Guus van der Ven helped set up a green-tech playground, De Ceuvel. Built on an old shipyard in Amsterdam, the site was heavily polluted. Now it's being cleaned up using pollution-extracting plants and is home to a creative co-working space thriving on renewable energy and recycled materials. Even human waste is turned into fertilizer and used to grow food in the on-site greenhouse. In 2009, 195 countries agreed to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. Belgium was one of them - but Ignace Schops, director of an NGO that runs Belgium's national parks, says his government isn't taking the action needed to fulfill that promise. So together with a creative group, he is suing the Belgium parliament to cut CO2 emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020, and 87 percent by 2050. Tobias Postulka is passionate about boats and passionate about protecting the planet. That's why he converted an old fishing boat into an eco dream, running solely on solar power. Even on cloudy days, the solar panels are more than up to the job. He\u2019s now even inviting groups of tourists, friends and school kids aboard to educate them about the power of the sun - and to ship them across Berlin. Guido Borgers uses sheer physical strength to provide 100 percent carbon-neutral transportation around the German capital. Unlike many of his competitors on Berlin's bike rickshaw market, which have bikes powered by electric engines, Guido's vehicle relies solely on muscle power. More than just a taxi driver, he somehow finds the breath to give guided tours of the historic sights along the way. With the average German producing 250 kilograms of waste every year, Milena Glimbovski found herself asking: \"Why is all of this food I buy every day wrapped in so much plastic? Is that really necessary?\" That's why she founded Berlin\u2019s first package-free shop: \"Original Unverpackt.\" It gives customers a more climate-friendly way to shop, with more than 400 products - minus the trash - on sale. What used to be a coal mining region has become a green festival haven, where five colossal steel excavators provide a dramatic backdrop as up to 25,000 festival goers dance the night away. Thies Schr\u00f6der, CEO of the festival site Ferropolis, is determined to host a climate-friendly party and pave the way to a greener festival future. 75 percent of Ferropolis\u2019 energy comes directly from solar. Windtest Grevenbroich gives wind turbines a rigorous going over to gather the data manufacturers need to get the best performance out of these green power behemoths. Benjamin B\u00f6hme's job involves finding new locations where the turbines can reap their zero-carbon energy harvest. He says the German government needs to do more to reach its target of 80 percent renewable power. Author: Anne-Sophie Br\u00e4ndlin, Ruth Krause I think it's mostly hip hop. My musical influencers are mostly rappers. All throughout my album I'm referencing a lot of my favorite rappers. You'll hear scratches and cuts from Jay Z, Eminem and MC Lyte. There's references to Nas, Mobb Deep and De La Soul. My musical influences tend to be a little old-school, from the 1990s and 2000s, and not so much the rappers that are big today. I'm in my 30s, so that's the rap I grew up on. One of the references I make is for instance \"Mo\u00a0Carbon\u00a0Mo\u00a0Problems.\" It's a paraphrase of a Notorious B.I.G. song called \"Mo Money\u00a0Mo Problems,\" which was a big hit in the 90s. In that chorus he said:\u00a0\"The mo money we come across, the mo problems we'll see.\"\u00a0Carbon is the main driver of climate change because methane and CFCs and CO2 are all carbon-based greenhouse gasses. So carbon in the atmosphere is the summary problem that we have to overcome and the more of it we have in the atmosphere, the more problems we end up with on earth. Out of your entire new album \"Rap Guide to Climate Chaos\"\u00a0-\u00a0which song is your favorite and why? I think I'd have to say the song \"Carbon Bubble\"\u00a0because it's fun and dancy. It's actually really a dance song. It's got a bit of a Lily Allen or Amy Winehouse flavor to it. I got an amazing soul singer named Mariella, who is based in New York, to do the hook. But the song is actually all about carbon finance models and how you can think of the carbon bubble concept as the subprime mortgage bubble of 2008, which crushed the global economy. Potentially, our reliance on fossil fuel and valuing the fossil fuel reserves as part of a company's stock is actually a huge mistake financially. It's irresponsible, because if we really have to keep all the fossil fuel on the ground, then those companies are worth a lot less than we think and so are the economies based on those companies' values. So the song is a very nerdy policy-wonk-analysis of cap-and-trade versus carbon tax versus business as usual from a financial perspective, but at the same time it's\u00a0a super fun, bouncy dance song, which has some great saxophone and horn lines in it. So it's about as much musical whimsy as you can imagine mixing with as much policy complexity in the form of one song, and that's really what I'm all about.\u00a0 What do you want your listeners to take away from your music? I don't know of I want them to be entirely persuaded and indoctrinated by everything I say, but I hope I give them a sense of curiosity and have provoked them to go look this up more and take more of an active interest. I think if I can snap people out of apathy and make them feel like: yes, this matters and yes, I need to get informed on it, then that'll be enough.

{"id": null, "body": "     World leaders have failed to set a firm date for achieving carbon neutrality or for phasing out coal. Activists had hoped for a stronger signal from the G-20 ahead of the UN's climate change conference, COP26. Global leaders have struggled to reach any firm agreements over climate change After the weekend's summit of heads of state from the world's 20 largest economies, little progress was made as key political figures gathered\u00a0 in\u00a0Glasgow for a crucial climate change conference, COP26 . While leaders said they would stick to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, no firm date has been set for\u00a0achieving carbon neutrality, according to a joint communique released by COP26 on Sunday. At a press conference following the recognition that little progress was made during the summit, current Italian Prime Minster and\u00a0G-20 President Mario Draghi said that without multilateralism \"we go nowhere\" in regards to addressing the climate crisis. UN Secretary-General\u00a0Antonio Guterres\u00a0expressed his disappointment\u00a0over a lack of any concrete conclusions from the summit. \"While I welcome the G-20's recommitment to global solutions,\" he tweeted, \"I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled \u2014 but at least they are not buried. Onwards to COP26\u00a0in Glasgow to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive and to implement promises on finance and adaptation for people and\u00a0planet.\" The G-20 leaders failed to give assurances for\u00a0ending coal-fueled power, according to a statement. \"We will do our utmost to avoid building new unabated coal power generation capacity, taking national circumstances into account, with a view to accelerating the transition away from coal to meet timeframes aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement,\" the statement said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and US President Joe Biden\u00a0struck optimistic tones following the meeting in Rome. The fact that the group of the world's strongest economies agreed in principle to support the Paris Agreement's\u00a01.5-degree\u00a0target for reducing greenhouse gases was a \"very, very good result\" and the G-20 leaders had thus sent a \"good signal\" ahead of the COP26. DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen\u00a0said Merkel was \"happy to see a joint declaration that every leader was able to sign off.\" \"We have to keep in mind that at previous G-20 summits there were declarations that only 19 of the G-20 leaders\u00a0signed,\" von Nahmen added, referring to when former US President Donald Trump refused to sign on to a G-20 climate statement. President Biden said the G-20 leaders made \"tangible\"\u00a0progress on climate change, though he lamented the absence of Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping from the talks in the Italian capital. Biden said it's disappointing that Russia and\u00a0China \"basically didn't show up\"\u00a0with commitments.  The lack of assurances after the Rome summit\u00a0came\u00a0as a disappointment to climate\u00a0activists, who had been seeking firm assurances from the G-20 members Earlier on Sunday, environmental\u00a0activists\u00a0Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate penned\u00a0an open letter to the media as the G-20 summit came to a conclusion. \"The climate crisis is only going to become more urgent,\" the pair wrote.\u00a0\"We can still avoid the worst consequences, we can still turn this around.

{"id": null, "body": "     Despite several steps in a positive direction, India's efforts are widely seen as a long way from the drastic measures needed to respond to the climate emergency.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unlike other major emitters, India has not yet committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the UN Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in Glasgow next week, he will represent the third biggest polluter in the world, with coal accounting for 70% of its power generation. Modi's attendance, nevertheless,\u00a0will be seen as critical,\u00a0since the leader of the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, Chinese\u00a0President Xi Jinping, is not expected to attend. Modi's focus will likely be to portray India as a part of the solution to climate change, rather than the problem. The South Asian country has not yet submitted its latest plans to combat climate change, but it is expected to revise its goals announced in 2015. India is the only major country to be on track to achieve its targets set out in the landmark Paris climate agreement , according to the UN Environment Program's Emission Gap Report. For instance, India plans to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP \u2014 the volume of carbon emissions emitted for every unit of GDP \u2014 by around 35% by 2030 from 2005 levels. \"India has achieved its voluntary target of reducing emissions intensity of its GDP by 21% over 2005 levels by 2020,\" the country's environment minister said last November. The country is also nearing its 2015 goal of achieving about 40% share of non-fossil fuel-based electricity generating capacity, which the government expects will be achieved by 2023 \u2014 seven years ahead of schedule. Sumaira Abdulali, founder of\u00a0Indian environmental NGO the Awaaz Foundation,\u00a0said that while achieving some goals is great, there are many ways of quantifying one's achievements. \"We are very good at crunching numbers internationally,\" she told DW. \"Even with agencies like the UN, everything looks wonderful on paper, we are going to achieve all these goals, we are going to do all these things which are all positive,\" she said. \"But on the ground, what does it mean? No one comes and checks. That's where the problem is. There's a disconnect between the ground reality and the numbers.\" She cited the example of electric vehicles, powered by coal-fired electricity .\u00a0 \"Studies show that EVs reduce emissions significantly in most parts of the world but not where\u00a0there is coal involved in firing those EVs. So, we're not only using coal, which is in itself a huge environmental issue, but we're actually cutting down forests to have those coal powered EVs.\"\u00a0 One of the areas where India seems to be lagging behind is in its commitment to enhance its carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by large-scale tree plantation.\u00a0 This has been exasperated by the government's plan to privatize the coal mining sector.\u00a0 While India may well exceed its targets, or the Nationally Determined Contributions according to the Paris accord, there have been questions over whether the goals were ambitious enough.\u00a0 Climate Action Tracker, an independent research group that tracks governments' climate actions, has rated India's efforts as \"highly insufficient.\"\u00a0 Nandikesh Sivalingam, director of the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said India's goals are a reflection of geopolitical realities, rather than based on science. \"India's climate ambition with respect to what's happening globally, and the commitments made by other countries, is not science-based. It is purely based on geopolitics,\" Sivalingam told DW. \"India would only commit\u00a0proportionate to what other countries are also putting on the table,\" he said. \"Accumulatively, none of the countries are doing enough to save the planet. So, in that sense, what India is doing is in line with all other countries, because everybody has to pull their weight.\" But as far as revising goals are concerned, he believes India is in a good position to commit to a coal peak before 2030. Coal peak means the country caps the highest amount of coal consumption in a particular year and then it brings it down in the subsequent years to reach net zero. \"One missing element in India's commitment is absolute reduction in carbon emissions,\" Sivalingam said. \"I think a coal peak year is a reasonably good target for India to achieve before 2030.\" Unlike other major emitters, India has not yet committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. While the United States has given 2050 as the year it would achieve net zero emissions, China has penciled it in for a decade later. Reaching the net zero target means the country will evenly balance the amount of greenhouse gas produced with the amount removed from the atmosphere. But\u00a0Chandra\u00a0Bhushan, a New Delhi-based environment and climate change expert,\u00a0believes simply committing to net zero doesn't make any sense until it is rooted in domestic law. \"Even if countries like the US and China say that they will achieve net zero by 2050 or 2060,\u00a0it is essentially the word of one leader versus that of the next one,\" he told DW. \"In many ways the debate about net zero and committing to it without having the legal or institutional basis for net zero is silly,\" Bhushan said.\u00a0 \"India can also announce a net zero target by 2050. But who cares? Who among the current leadership will be alive in 2050 to be held accountable?\" he added. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, India is seventh on the list of countries most affected by climate change . While there have been several measures in a positive direction, India's climate efforts are widely seen as a long way from the drastic measures needed to respond to the climate emergency.\n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "COP26: What is India doing to combat climate change?", "article_name": "cop26-what-is-india-doing-to-combat-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/cop26-what-is-india-doing-to-combat-climate-change/a-59653129", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 5859, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:29.313494"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Progressive global warming will have an outsized effect on countries in Asia and Oceania. In a DW interview, Kira Vinke from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research explains what makes the region more vulnerable. A recent report from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research (PIK) is predicting devastating climate-change consequences for the Asia-Pacific region. In 2016, the ADB invested $3.7 billion (3.16 billion euros) for initiatives combating climate change and this amount is set to be increased to $6 billion by 2020. DW spoke with Kira Vinke from the PIK about why this region is especially affected by climate change. Kira Vinke from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research DW: Why is the Asia-Pacific region so strongly affected by the consequences of climate change? Kira Vinke: There are two major reasons for this. The first is that there are geographically vulnerable regions in Asia \u2013 for example, the large river deltas or the Himalayas that provide fresh water for over a billion people. The other is that there are large populations of poor people in Asia who live in at-risk areas such as in Bangladesh, which is vulnerable to tropical storms that are causing more catastrophic flooding than ever before. What scenarios are illustrated in the latest ABD report? We compared two scenarios in the report. The first was oriented on meeting the Paris agreement goals of limiting global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius. We also imagined a scenario with which everything continues as before and globally we will reach warming of 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. For the Asian landmass, that would mean an average temperature increase of 6 degrees Celsius. People would not be able to adapt to the climatic consequences of this warming. Think about New Delhi, for example, where I lived for a long time. Even today, at temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius, it is hardly possible to spend time outside unprotected. Was does this mean for advancements in Asian development in recent years? There have really been some big successes in the Asia-Pacific region with fighting poverty and disaster relief. But the consequences of climate change could undermine these advancements. For example, data show that unabated climate change would increase precipitation up to 50 percent in many countries across the region, while it would decrease in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The level of rice production in certain countries could decrease by half before the year 2100. Extreme weather events like Typhoon Haiyan will also occur more often. This means we have to fight on both fronts against poverty and climate change. One cannot succeed without the other. What steps have countries in the region taken to address the consequences of climate change? There is not one answer that covers every country. But it is already true that a large portion of global emissions are emitted by production in Asia and the goods are consumed in the West. Asian nations are mostly ready to take part of the responsibility. You can see this as countries like China and India stand behind their climate goals. Climate change awareness is present in Asia, but what concrete measures are being taken? This also differs greatly by region. There are forerunners like the Palawan region in the Philippines that have decided on switching completely to renewable energy. But there are also unfortunate examples of countries not maintaining climate and environmental protection standards. We see this with the pollution of the Ganges in India. There are regulations in place, but there has been little success with applying these rules because it would threaten the livelihood of many people. Emissions reduction is complicated by economic factors. For example, it is clear that we cannot continue to build with steel and cement because their production requires an extreme level of emissions. The cities of the future \u2013 which are being built in Asia \u2013 cannot be built like before. We should build with wood or carbon fiber. Vinke conducting interviews in Bangladesh What did your own experiences in Asia teach you about the consequences of climate change? I was in Bangladesh for my own research and I spoke with people who needed to migrate because of extreme storms because their land was flooded or ruined by salt. They are forced to move into slums in large cities. I visited some of them and asked if they thought the environment was changing, and they all agreed it was. Rain is no longer regular. Long dry phases are followed by very strong precipitation. Most of these people have little education and no explanation of what is\u00a0happening with their climate \u2013 and that is dangerous. These people don't realize that the next storm surge could be double the size. How are these people supposed to shape their future under these conditions? What can be done about this? I think countries that have historically produced the most emissions have a responsibility to help smaller countries, for example, through technology transfer.\u00a0The poorest countries, like Bangladesh, produce cheap goods for the West without participating in the benefits of economic growth. Conversely, there are huge profits being made in the West that cause a massive amount of emissions, which have a hugely negative effect on people in Bangladesh.

{"id": null, "body": "     The Turkish parliament has ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change more than five years after Ankara first signed the deal. The move comes in time for next month's UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. Wildfires fueled by climate change devastated parts of Turkey this summer Turkey's parliamentarians on Wednesday unanimously approved the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0compared to pre-industrial levels. Although one of the first countries to sign the agreement\u00a0in April 2016, Turkey had held off ratifying it until now\u00a0while seeking to be reclassified as a developing, rather than developed country. That would mean it would not face such\u00a0harsh emission reduction targets and would benefit\u00a0from financial support. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) currently lists Turkey in the Annex I group, described as industrialized countries. However, Turkey has sent a request\u00a0to the secretariat of the UNFCCC to have its name removed from that list. The proposal is to be discussed at the upcoming\u00a0COP26 Climate Change Conference to be held in Glasgow from October 31 to November\u00a012.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change is likely to have contributed to a 7 percent spike in the suicide rate in India over the last 30 years, a new scientific study says. India is experiencing a suicide epidemic, in particular in rural areas. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) has\u00a0found an increase of\u00a01 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on an average day during the agricultural growing season was correlated with 67 more suicides than average in India - an increase of 7 percent. The study\u00a0out of the University of California in Berkeley\u00a0represents the first scientific research into links between changes in the climate and suicide in India.\u00a0 UC Berkeley researcher and report\u00a0author Tamma Carleton told DW that temperature increases outside of the growing season from June to September showed no significant correlation with suicide rates. This suggests harvests - and thus also climate - may be\u00a0a key factor. Carleton tested the links between climate change, crop yields and suicide by comparing the numbers for India's reported suicides in each of its 32 states from 1967 and 2013, using a dataset prepared by the Indian National Crime Records Bureau, along with statistics on India's crop yields, and high-resolution climate data. \"This is not a deterministic relationship between temperature and suicide,\" Carleton told DW. \"You can think about it like the rise in car accidents on rainy days: There are many possible factors causing any individual car accident, but we can measure the elevated risk of an accident caused by a rainy day, on top of these other factors like texting and driver error, by comparing total car accident rates on different days.\" More than 12,900 farmers\u00a0killed themselves in India in 2012 - one of the highest figures on record. More than 300,000 farmers and farmworkers have killed themselves in the country since 1995, according to World Health Organization figures. More than half of India's working population is employed in rain-dependent agriculture , which is highly sensitive to climate fluctuations such as monsoon rains, heat waves\u00a0and drought. Three of the \"big five\"\u00a0suicide states - Maharashtra,\u00a0Andhra\u00a0Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh - are located along India's coast. Farmers in these states rely heavily on the monsoon each year for their crops. \"The southern region of India tends to have the most severe increase in suicide for a given change in temperature,\" Carleton told DW. \"These states tend to be hotter on average, and also tend to have a higher average suicide rate in all years,\" she said. Suicide rates were highest among smallholders Suicide epidemic About 800,000 people in the world commit suicide every year, according to the WHO -\u00a0of which 135,000 (17 percent) are in India. India also\u00a0accounts for 17.5 percent of the world's population. But this figure may even be higher, as suicides tend to go under-reported in India. Until 2014, attempted suicide was a criminal offense. Add to this that police don't always count someone who has committed suicide as a farmer if they don't own the title to their land - an increasing number of farmers do not. In some parts of India, furthermore, suicide is a taboo and family members may report a different cause of death. \"It is very possible that the link between temperature and suicide depends on the religious or ethnic characteristics of a given region or individual,\" Carleton told DW. Suicide is an incredibly complex phenomenon, she explained, with many contributing factors.\u00a0 About 70 percent of suicide victims in 2015 had an income of less than 100,000 rupees (1,300 euros) per year, India's National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data show. A Lancet study by researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 2014 showed suicide rates in rural areas to be almost double those of urban areas. The most common method of suicide was ingesting pesticide. Economic factors A 2014 study by researchers from Cambridge University's Department of Sociology and University College London's Department of Political Science found that India's suicide rate is highest in areas with the most debt-ridden farmers, who have smallholdings of less than 1\u00a0hectare\u00a0and are producing cash crops like cotton and coffee - both of which are susceptible to price fluctuations on global markets. Lower rainfall and increased temperatures are hitting Indian farmers hard They found that in areas such as Gujarat, where cash crops are mainly cultivated on large-scale farms, the suicide rates were lower. The price of cotton in real terms is a twelfth of what it was 30 years ago . The government eliminated\u00a0subsidies for cotton in 1997 - this corresponds with the increased suicide rate among farmers. Tangible measures to reduce suicides The study shows that global warming - which could make India three degrees Celsius hotter by 2050 - is already hitting Indian society hard. Carleton believes the suicide rate will continue to\u00a0rise as temperatures continue to warm. The government has established a $1.3 billion (1 billion euro) crop insurance plan aimed at reducing the suicide rate. Improvements in rural credit markets may also help to reduce the rising suicide rate, Carleton believes. \"The tragedy is unfolding today - this is not a problem for future generations. This is our problem, right now,\" she said. \"Without intervention\u00a0that helps families adapt to a warmer climate, it's likely we will see a rising number of lives lost to suicide as climate change worsens in India,\" Carleton said. Indian authorities say that more than 1,150 people have died as a result of a blistering heat wave that swept across the South Asian nation. Most victims of the soaring temperatures have been homeless and elderly people as well as construction workers. This man in Hyderabad, the capital of the southern Indian state of Telangana and de jure capital of Andhra Pradesh, is resting in the shade. These two southern states are among the worst-affected, with temperatures reaching 48 degrees Celsius in some areas. However, there could be some respite from the sweltering heat as some parts of north and south India are expected to experience thunderstorms in next two days, thus bringing down the temperature by a few notches. Major relief is only expected to come in June with the monsoon. People in the capital New Delhi are also affected by the extreme temperatures, which have reportedly caused some roads to partially melt. This police officer has found a spot in the shade. The heat wave has also led to lower water levels. Disaster management authorities have called on the people in the affected areas to drink water and not to venture into the outside without a cap, especially around noon. Shown here are Indian fishermen catching fish in a shrunken pond in the village of Phaphamau on the outskirts of Allahabad. Those who can, take the opportunity to plunge into water and beat the heat, just like this man in Andhra Pradesh. Necessity is the mother on invention: This commuter in Allahabad uses the train water pipes to have a cold shower at a railway station in Allahabad. These two boys from the western Indian city on Ahmedabad jump into the waters of the Sabarmati River to cool off themselves. Meteorologists say temperatures soared to 43 degrees in the state of Gujarat on this day. Officials say the temperatures currently being recorded in many parts of the country are four notches above the season's average. The Indian summer starts in April and lasts until the arrival of the monsoon. So far increased rainfall activity has been observed over the Bay of Bengal. The rains are expected to reach India's southern tip in the beginning of July and then move to the north and west.

The annual jamboree is taking place against the backdrop of Australia's worst ever bushfires. Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg returns\u00a0to the Swiss ski resort of Davos for the 2020 World Economic Forum with a strong and clear message: put an end to the fossil fuel \"madness.\" Thunberg's missive is aimed at, among others, US President Donald Trump, who in the past has mocked the Swedish environmental campaigner, saying she has an \"anger management problem.\" Trump, who is among the most prominent climate change skeptics , is returning to Davos after giving it a miss in 2019 due to a government shutdown. It's the first time Trump and Thunberg would be present at the same event since last year's United Nations climate change summit in New York, where the teenager could be seen staring down the US president as the two briefly crossed paths. Later, Thunberg \u2014 named Time magazine's Person of the Year 2019 \u2014 told the BBC that she \"wouldn't have wasted [her] time\" talking to Trump about the climate crisis at the UN event. \"Honestly, I don't think I would have said anything because obviously he's not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me,\" she said. 'State of emergency' Thunberg, who famously told Davos participants last year that \"our house is on fire,\" has, however, found support among the organizers of the World Economic Forum, including its 81-year-old founder Klaus Schwab, who said the world is facing \"a state of emergency.\" \"We do not want to reach the tipping point of irreversibility on climate change,\"\u00a0Schwab told reporters on Tuesday. \"We do not want the next generations to inherit a world, which becomes ever more hostile and ever less habitable \u2014\u00a0just think of the wildfires in Australia,\" he said. An annual risks survey published by the WEF on Wednesday put climate and other environmental threats ahead of risks posed by geopolitical tensions and cyberattacks. It's the first time that the survey found the top five long-term risks were all environmental, from extreme weather events to businesses and governments failing to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Stakeholder capitalism Sustainability is the main theme at this year's Davos meeting, taking place at a time the world is grappling with global warming becoming worse because of growing divisions among nations and businesses on how to tackle it. The meeting, which will see over 50 heads of state and government, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, descend on the Alpine resort, seeks to give concrete meaning to \"stakeholder capitalism\" \u2014 a concept that businesses should serve the interests of all society rather than simply their shareholders. \"Business has now to fully embrace stakeholder capitalism, which means not only maximizing profits, but use their capabilities and resources in cooperation with governments and civil society to address the key issues of this decade,\" Schwab said. \"They have to actively contribute to a more cohesive and sustainable world.\" Davos 2020\u00a0by the numbers After lengthy talks, a government-appointed commission announces Germany plans to stop producing energy from coal-fired plants by 2038. Climate campaigners say it's too little, too late. Germany currently generates nearly 40% of its electricity from coal and has failed to meet targets set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The anticipated phaseout cost: \u20ac40 billion ($44 billion). After a five-year study, scientists warn two-thirds of glaciers in the Hindu-Kush-Himalayan region could melt by 2100 if global carbon emissions are not cut. Meltwater from the area, home to Mount Everest, feeds into 10 of the world's most important river systems. Water shortages would cripple food and energy production in eight countries, directly or indirectly affecting nearly 2 billion people. \"One of the deadliest storms on record in the Southern Hemisphere\" \u2014 according to the UN \u2014 hits low-lying Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, killing nearly 1,000 people and causing widespread damage.

Extinction Rebellion causes more than a week of travel chaos in London with disruptive, colorful protests across the British capital. In the UK and around the world, the activist group's rallies make headlines throughout the year as they promote radical political, economic and social change to avert the worst effects of global warming. Critics call their plans to abandon fossil fuels unrealistic. At the EU elections, voter turnout is up \u2014 and populist and environmentalist parties make big gains. European Green parties win 74 seats in the 751-member European Parliament. The German Greens take more than 20% of the vote, their best-ever results. Frans Timmermans is chosen as the European Commission's new climate chief, with the bloc aiming to cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Thousands of protesters descend on Garzweiler, one of Germany's biggest open-pit coal mines near Cologne, protesting plans to expand at the expense of nearby old-growth forest. Meanwhile, an estimated 40,000 people from across Europe march through Aachen to campaign for more climate action. Over the Channel, the UK parliament becomes the first in the world to declare a symbolic climate emergency. Much of Europe suffers through an intense heat wave, with temperatures breaking 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) across the continent \u2014 smashing records set just weeks earlier. People are advised to limit time spent outdoors, while travelers face delays due to speed restrictions on superheated railway tracks. Climate monitoring agencies report July as the hottest month on record. The number of forest fires in the Amazon surges to its highest point since 2010, and thousands of firefighters are deployed to put out the blaze. President Jair Bolsonaro blasts a global outcry that not enough is being done to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest, insisting on Brazil's sovereign right. Previously, he blamed rainforest protections for hindering economic development. Teen activist Greta Thunberg, who inspired Fridays for Future protests worldwide, blasts world leaders at the United Nations for \"failing to act\" on the climate crisis. \"Change is coming, whether you like it or not.\" As millions of young people join marches around the world, leaders from more than 70 countries commit to carbon neutrality by 2050 \u2014 but not China, Russia, India, Japan or China. Local groups, cities and young people around the world increasingly take their climate concerns to court in 2019. Just this month: a group of 15 youths (above) sues the Canadian government for violating their fundamental rights with policies that fail to curb CO2 emissions.

Author: Martin Kuebler Greener Davos The annual jamboree \u2014 which is marking its golden jubilee this year \u2014 has often been criticized for its own carbon footprint, mainly left behind by leaders flying in their private jets. The WEF, on its part, is touting that this year's meet would be among the most sustainable international summits ever held. It promises to buy carbon credits to offset flights, line up more electric vehicles and offer locally-sourced food. \"It is something we take very seriously,'' Adrian Monck, the WEF's managing director, told reporters. \"There is nothing worse than an organization identifying a risk and doing nothing about it.\" The WEF plans to launch a scheme using public and private funds to plant 1\u00a0trillion trees by the end of this decade. Geopolitical tensions The summit that runs from Tuesday to Friday this week would also focus on issues such as global trade wars, inequality, record debt levels and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. While key leaders from Iraq, the Palestinian Authority, Pakistan and Afghanistan are expected to attend the event, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohamad Javad Zarif will\u00a0not be present as Tehran deals with protests following the downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet. Zarif's cancelation also comes against\u00a0the backdrop of rising tensions in the Middle East since US air strikes killed Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian general, earlier in the month.

While conceding that the health, safety and security of citizens all over the world was currently the main priority, they were quick to remind leaders that the pandemic should not overshadow the climate crisis, which scientists warn is swiftly becoming irreversible. \"Governments must now find answers for the global health crisis, but they can't ignore climate protection,\" said Ann-Kathrin Schneider, the head of international climate policy at Germany's Union for Environment and Nature Protection (BUND), wrote on Wednesday. Tasneem Essop, from the Climate Action Network (CAN), echoed this sentiment. \"Let us remember this pandemic is taking place against the backdrop of an ecological crisis,\" wrote Essop, whose network brings together roughly 1,300 environmental NGOS worldwide. Emma Howard Boyd, the chair of the UK's Environment Agency, a nondepartmental public body, pointed out that environmental activism, like other major causes of the 20th century, would resume its mission. The director of think tank Power Shift Africa, meanwhile, drew attention to the plight of developing nations where land and water systems are drying up. \"Before the pandemic countries were failing to deliver quick enough emissions reductions and support for the vulnerable.

The need for urgent climate action has been gaining greater momentum in recent years as increasing numbers of scientific reports point to the irreversibility of global warming if leaders fail to act. Water is becoming scarce in the Himalayas where glaciers have been losing 8 billions of ton every year Rising temperatures have seen Arctic regions lose significant amounts of snow and ice in recent years Hot on the heels of revelations in its 2018 report that revealed how dire circumstances would become even with warming limited to only 1.5 degrees Celsius , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released two further reports last year, which warned that emissions were putting unspeakable pressure on both land and sea. According to the IPCC, ocean warming has more than doubled since 1993 and, even if global warming were limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the impact on coastal ecosystems would still be \"severe.\" In a similar warming scenario, desertification of land would threaten the food supply for nearly 180 million people . Earlier this year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said COP26 would need to operate under the assumption that goals for a 1.5 degree warming scenario would begin this year . \"We need to demonstrate, starting this year, how we will achieve emissions reductions of 45% from 2010 levels this decade, and how we will reach net-zero emissions by mid-century,\" Guterres said. The UNFCCC confirmed on Wednesday that COP26 would be rescheduled for 2021, with a new date pending further discussions among its parties.

Being more conscious about what you buy (and what you don't) can go a long way toward helping our planet. Luckily, it's easier than ever to buy environmentally friendly products. Use your power as a consumer to support eco-conscious brands, shop second-hand when possible and just try to buy less \"stuff\" overall. It helps to always ask yourself if you really need something before buying it. Did you know almost a third of all food produced every year is lost or wasted? You can help reduce this figure by wasting as little of your own food as possible: Eat the leftovers, get creative with any extra ingredients and start a compost pile in your backyard with remaining scraps. Compost also makes a great fertilizer, so you won't have to buy any harmful chemical alternatives! While we're more connected than ever before, the simple act of remembering to turn off the lights, PCs, laptops and screens when you don't need them can save a huge amount of energy in the long-run. Keep it up and pretty soon you'll develop an easy habit that's also great for our planet! If you haven't already, this is the year to lend your voice to the growing movement for global climate action. And that doesn't have to mean protesting on the streets: Push your local politicians to act on climate change. Stay informed and talk to your friends, colleagues and neighbors about what they can do to help the planet. Don't underestimate the power of speaking up. We could probably all be a bit healthier when it comes to our diet choices. But switching to a more plant-based diet can also help fight climate change. Farming animals for meat and dairy is one of the biggest causes of deforestation and is a major source of CO2 emissions. Eating more plant-based foods can lower your individual impact on the environment. There's a reason we're reminded of the importance of recycling time and time again. The devastating consequences of plastic pollution is becoming increasingly obvious \u2014 especially in our oceans. Recycling means fewer new materials will need to be made. You can even upcycle if you're feeling particularly resourceful. Why not turn an old bottle into a lamp, or even a bird feeder? This year, make more of an effort to get out of the house and explore the most beautiful landscapes our Earth has to offer. It might not have a direct impact on climate action, but it's a great way to truly appreciate our planet \u2014 and remind us what we need to protect.

These live updates are now closed.\u00a0To read more on how the\u00a0three-day event unfolded\u00a0 please click here . World leaders meet the Queen of England at the G7 conference in Cornwall Criticism from health and environment campaigners followed the release of the final G7 communique. \"This G7 summit will live on in infamy,\" said Max Lawson, the head of inequality policy at international aid group Oxfam. \"Faced with the biggest health emergency in a century and a climate catastrophe that is destroying our planet, they have completely failed to meet the challenges of our times.\" \u00a0 Campaigners also complained that the G7\u00a0failed to go into details about how it will pay for a newly agreed \"Nature Compact\" \u2014 aimed to protect 30% of the world's land and oceans from further destruction by 2030. Additionally, the 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses for poorer countries falls far short of the 11 billion doses the World Health Organization said is needed to vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population and truly end the pandemic. Former British prime minister Gordon Brown said the lack of a more ambitious vaccination plan was \"an unforgivable moral failure.\" International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach meanwhile thanked \"G7 leaders for their support\" for the Tokyo games that were postponed for a year \u00a0due to the coronavirus pandemic. \"We take this as a great encouragement to deliver safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 for everybody in this spirit of worldwide solidarity,\" Bach said. US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden visited the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, following the end of the three-day G7 summit. The Bidens emerged from a Land Rover on Sunday to meet the awaiting queen before inspecting the Guard of Honor assembled on the castle grounds. US President Joe Biden and US First Lady Jill Biden headed to Windsor Castle to meet the British monarch The queen and the US first lady stayed on a dais as Biden walked along the guard. Once Sunday's inspection was completed, the queen and the Bidens headed into the castle for tea. Following the visit, Biden said \"I don't think she'll be insulted, but she reminded me of my mother.\" US President Joe Biden inspected the Guard of Honor during a visit to Windsor Castle US President Joe Biden said his fellow leaders agreed that \"America is back at the table and fully engaged,\" following a period of \"America First\" protectionist policy under former president Donald Trump. Here's a roundup G7 leaders' comments on Biden at the summit. A \"big breath of fresh air\" is how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, host of the summit in southwest England, described Biden, He told reporters Sunday that the G7 stood united anew in its \"democratic values.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel, attending her last G7 in the post, meanwhile said Biden had brought \"new momentum\" to resolving the world's problems at the three-day summit. French President Macron and US counterpart Biden hit it off during the G7 summit French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that it was a relief that he was now working with an American president who he termed was \"willing to cooperate.\" \"What you demonstrate is leadership is partnership,\" Macron said of Biden. Macron and Biden appeared to have built up quick chemistry during the in-person summit. The two draped their arms around each other and chatted animatedly when they walked together after the leaders' photo on Friday. US President Joe Biden said democracies were \"in a contest with autocratic governments around the world\" in his final address at the G7 conference. \"We're in a contest, not with China per se, ... with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in a rapidly changing 21st century,\" said Biden. He indicated Russia had its own problems to \"chew on,\" saying its president, Vladimir Putin, had not changed. \"Let me make it clear I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which in many cases he has not,\" Biden told reporters. The US president also stressed that his country was making a comeback in international diplomacy, following Trump. \"America's back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values,'' Biden said, before leaving Cornwall to visit Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. \"I think we've made progress in reestablishing American credibility among our closest friends.\" Biden said he does not view NATO as a \"protection racket.\" Trump had often criticized European member states for what he viewed as too low financial contributions to the organization. Biden also reported that global leaders were gratified that he accepted the science of climate change: \"One of the things some of my colleagues said to me when I was there was, 'Well, the United States' leadership recognizes there is global warming,''' Biden said. The final communique from the G7 meeting has been released to some media outlets.\u00a0 The document covers several topics On the coronavirus, the document: On climate change\u00a0and environment it: Pledges\u00a0to meet\u00a0$100 billion a year overdue funding to help poorer countries tackle climate change On Russia, the document: On other human rights issues, it: On China, it: On global economic issues, it: G7 leaders said in their draft communique that China must respect human rights in Xinjiang as well as allow Hong Kong freedoms. The group also expressed concern over what it called Beijing's growing influence in the East and South China Seas, and in the Taiwan Strait. \"We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,\" the\u00a0G7\u00a0said in the\u00a0communique that was almost finalized. Leaders also expressed concern over forced labor in China.\u00a0 \"The United States and our G7 partners remain deeply concerned by the use of all forms of forced labor in global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor of vulnerable groups and minorities and supply chains of the agricultural, solar, and garment sectors \u2014 the main supply chains of concern in Xinjiang,\" the document said. DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says G7\u00a0leaders have agreed to increase their financial support \"to make sure that they will be able to mobilize \u20ac100 billion for poorer nations to cope with the coincidences of climate change and to help them switch to clean energy.\"\u00a0 \"However, this promise was already made a decade ago and so far the leaders have not managed to live up to their promises,\" von Nahmen told DW.\u00a0Therefore, they are \"now saying they are definitely going to increase financial spending,\" she added. G7 leaders called for a\u00a0transparent, science-based study into the origins of COVID-19 convened by the World Health Organization, according to the draft communique.\u00a0 \"We\u00a0call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 COVID-19 Origins study including, as recommended by the experts\u2019 report, in\u00a0China,\" it said.\u00a0 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hopes that a new G7 task force can present details of the first infrastructure projects in developing countries in 2022. She also said that 2.3 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses should be distributed to low-income countries by\u00a0the end of next year. \"Germany is responsible for 350 million doses,\"\u00a0Merkel\u00a0said.\u00a0That includes 30 million doses that Germany had ordered and would distribute, she said. \"That will probably be more over time.\"\u00a0 The\u00a0G7\u00a0group has \"agreed that the pandemic can only be defeated globally,\" she said. \"The way out of the pandemic is vaccines,\" she stressed.\u00a0 Speaking about coal, for which the G7 leaders\u00a0are facing pressure to phase out state subsidies, Merkel said\u00a0the delegates had not\u00a0agreed on a date for ending the use of\u00a0the fossil fuel. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has joined the summit for its last day, urged the G7\u00a0to help finance the World Health Organization's\u00a0program\u00a0to increase COVID-19 testing, diagnostics and vaccines. \"We need to address the substantial financing gap for tests, treatments, critical supplies like oxygen and the health systems that enable testing, treatment and vaccination,\" Ramaphosa said in the presidency statement, referring to the\u00a0Access to the COVID-19 Tools Accelerator.\u00a0 \"If all\u00a0G7\u00a0countries met their fair share target, this initiative\u00a0would be two-thirds funded \u2013 and it would be 90% funded if all G20 countries made their fair share contributions,\" Ramaphosa said. G7 countries will provide one\u00a0billion COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next year and work with the private sector\u00a0and other countries to increase the contribution over the next months, according to a communique draft. \"The commitments since we last met in February 2021 including here in Carbis Bay provide for one\u00a0billion doses over the next year,\" the communique said. \"We will work together with the private sector, the G20 and other countries to increase this contribution over the months to come,\" it added. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lauded the vaccine pledge but said it's not enough. He said at least 11 billion doses are needed to\u00a0 vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population \u00a0by the middle of next year. \"We need more and we need them faster,'' Tedros said. DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says climate policy is a \"top priority\" for G7 countries. Speaking from Cornwall, England, where the G7 summit is taking place, von Nahmen\u00a0says leaders are expected to discuss the phasing out of diesel and patrol cars as well as ending the use of coal \"as soon as possible.\" She\u00a0added that the leaders are unlikely to specify a deadline. \u00a0 Concerning\u00a0relations between the West and China, von Nahmen said:\u00a0\"The US is pushing and hoping for a united front to counter China's rise,\" with European countries being \"very cautious not to push it too far to the extent that it would prevent any cooperation with China.\" \"What we expect from the (final) communique is to strike a balance, to stress that it is important to work on global issues with Beijing such as climate change,\" she said,\u00a0adding that the G7 would also be expected to \"call out China for human rights abuses\" and that the Chinese government should \"use fair methods to compete with western economies.\" Oxfam activists get creative at a climate protest at Swanpool Beach near Falmouth during the G7 summit The heads of state\u00a0plan to commit to steps to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources. The US, Germany, Britain and Canada say they intend to provide developing countries with up to $2 billion (\u20ac1.65 billion) to accelerate their phase-out of\u00a0coal. A White House statement also said that the\u00a0G7\u00a0would coordinate climate targets so that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as outlined in the Paris climate agreement\u00a0\u2014\u00a0remains \"within reach.\" British naturalist Sir David Attenborough is to\u00a0address\u00a0the G7 delegates by video link, warning that countries must take urgent action to avoid human-made environmental disasters. In remarks released ahead of his speech, Attenborough said global warming and loss of biodiversity are \"beyond doubt,\" as is the fact that \"our societies and nations are unequal.\" \"The question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether, as a result of these intertwined facts, we are on the verge of destabilizing the entire planet.\" \"If that is so, then the decisions we make this decade, in particular the decisions made by the most economically advanced nations, are the most important in human history,\" Attenborough added. The third and final day of the G7 summit takes\u00a0place in Cornwall, England, on Sunday. The UK wants to use the summit to coordinate global climate targets and persuade world leaders to agree on tougher climate measures, such as the phasing out of coal. The heads of state and government\u00a0will discuss steps on how to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources as well as how to\u00a0accelerate the phase-out of\u00a0coal. mvb/mm (AP, Reuters, dpa) The US leads efforts to create a western alternative to China's New Silk Road project, but the EU is wary of setting up an anti-China coalition.

{"id": null, "body": "     Ocean temperatures and water levels are continuing to rise as a result of human intervention. This is having a widespread impact on sealife and weather patterns. Humans are continuing to have an adverse affect on the world's oceans The state of the world's oceans is worsening, according to an environmental report released on Wednesday by a European Commission-funded marine monitoring service. Oceans cover over 70% of Earth's surface and are crucial in regulating the climate. The Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service report highlighted the speed of change in oceans due to human intervention. The warming of the world's oceans and melting land ice caused sea levels to rise by 2.5 millimeters (.1 inches) per year in the Mediterranean. Worldwide, levels are rising by up to 3.1 millimeters each year. Although this seems like a small figure, the report pointed to\u00a0 the flooding of Venice in November 2019 , when the water level rose up to 1.89 meters, as an example of the impending consequences. The report showed that marine life is migrating to cooler waters. Warmer waters are also causing the populations of some sea-dwelling species to shrink. It found that sole, European lobster, sea bass and edible crabs were being adversely affected by extreme heat fluctuations in the North Sea. The report found that Arctic sea ice reached its lowest levels in the last two years. Between 1979 and 2020, the report found the Arctic lost an area of ice about six times the size of Germany. Loss of Arctic sea ice could contribute to regional warming, erosion of Arctic coasts and changes in global weather patterns. \"Climate change, pollution and overexploitation have caused unprecedented stress on the ocean,\" Karina von Schuckmann, chair of the Ocean State Report, said in a statement accompanying the report. Schuckmann said accurate and timely monitoring is crucial to better understanding the oceans and responding to changes. The Copernicus Marine Service\u00a0is designed to serve EU policies as well as international legal commitments related to ocean governance. It provides inputs that support major EU and\u00a0international policies\u00a0and initiatives concerning the environment and oceans. The findings of the report will likely contribute to these areas. The report follows almost two months after a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that the key 1.5 degrees Celsius\u00a0 (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) threshold in the fight to stop climate change will be crossed within the next 15 years. \n kmm/sms (dpa,marine.copernicus.eu) \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate change: EU-backed study shows alarming state of oceans", "article_name": "climate-change-eu-backed-study-shows-alarming-state-of-oceans", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-eu-backed-study-shows-alarming-state-of-oceans/a-59261525", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 2668, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:33.920068"}

The new measures will remain in place \"until further notice,\" with the city studying the results, said a spokesperson for Brussels Mayor Philippe Close. \"Ending the lockdown poses great challenges, and radical decisions are necessary,\" said Elke Van den Brandt, the regional mobility minister. \"This could start a cycling revolution in Brussels.\" Thyl\u00a0Van\u00a0Gyzegem, a mobility expert with\u00a0 regional NGO Inter-Environment\u00a0Brussels \u00a0(IEB), was somewhat more pragmatic. \"It's unlikely that the pandemic will significantly change the main travel dynamics in Brussels, at least in the near future,\" he said. Van Gyzegem pointed out that more than half of Brussels residents already\u00a0relied on\u00a0something other than a car,\u00a0and that bicycle use and walking had been steadily increasing in recent years.\u00a0 And he didn't\u00a0think\u00a0Brussels' notorious traffic jams would disappear any time soon, with high rents continuing to push people out to the suburbs and beyond, forcing\u00a0many\u00a0to\u00a0rely on cars for their\u00a0commutes.\u00a0In addition, the Belgian love affair with the\u00a0fiscally-advantageous\u00a0company car\u00a0\u2014 in 2019, a record 315,557 new cars were registered in the country, 7% more than in 2018 according to the Belgian Automobile and Cycle Federation \u2014 remained a \"very strong incentive\" to use private vehicles, he said.\u00a0\u00a0 \"For this reason, the Brussels Region cannot, on its own, and on the sole basis of infrastructure works [\u2026] revolutionize mobility,\"\u00a0Van Gyzegem\u00a0told DW, though he did expect\u00a0the region's \"tactical move\"\u00a0would bring\u00a0some transport benefits in the long term. Freshly painted road markings clearly show where cyclists have priority Using\u00a0crisis\u00a0as an\u00a0opportunity Other cities around the world have\u00a0also\u00a0been using the pandemic to try out alternatives to automobile-based mobility. In London\u00a0and other\u00a0major centers, for example, health workers have had\u00a0temporary\u00a0free access to electric bikes courtesy of bike retailers and ride-sharing companies. In the Italian city of Milan,\u00a0 particularly hard hit by the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic , officials have announced plans to convert 35 kilometers of streets into more cycling and walking space, with lower speed limits,\u00a0makeshift\u00a0bike lanes and wider sidewalks. Some\u00a0provisional\u00a0moves have brought about permanent change.\u00a0After widened bike lanes began popping up in Berlin and other German cities \u2014 an act\u00a0the opposition Free Democrats called \"an unnecessary provocation\" by the bike lobby during the crisis \u2014 the federal government introduced nationwide reforms that banned drivers from stopping on bike lanes and required a minimum 1.5-meter gap between cars and cyclists, a measure previously only recommended. Read more :\u00a0\u00a0 Five cities leading on climate action Vancouver, Denver, Budapest, New York,\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0and numerous other cities have also introduced short-term street closures and temporary bike lanes,\u00a0some more ambitious than others.\u00a0Bogota, Colombia, which already boasts an extensive cycling network,\u00a0in March added more than 100 kilometers of emergency bike lanes marked by traffic cones to take the pressure of its TransMilenio bus rapid transit network.

An ongoing research project in Nigeria highlighted by the Transformative Urban Mobility Initiative\u00a0(TUMI), for example, showed that\u00a0 coronavirus\u00a0measures in the capital,\u00a0Abuja ,\u00a0which\u00a0included\u00a0reducing\u00a0bus capacity and\u00a0suspending Uber services,\u00a0resulted in transport becoming increasingly expensive and restricted, leaving\u00a0some\u00a0passengers stranded and vulnerable \u2014 women in particular.\u00a0 TUMI,\u00a0a\u00a0global\u00a0sustainable mobility\u00a0group\u00a0which includes\u00a0Germany's agency for international cooperation, GIZ, has been\u00a0 sharing\u00a0COVID-related\u00a0city\u00a0interventions\u00a0on its\u00a0platform .\u00a0Armin Wagner,\u00a0a senior\u00a0transport\u00a0policy\u00a0adviser\u00a0with GIZ,\u00a0gave the example of\u00a0Singra, Bangladesh, where\u00a0electric rickshaws were\u00a0brought in\u00a0as part of\u00a0an\u00a0\"emergency action plan\"\u00a0to\u00a0fill the gap left by\u00a0public transport. \"In times of social distancing, these vehicles have been deployed to supply much-needed food to the public as part of the\u00a0'home delivery system'\u00a0in Singra.

But\u00a0crowded public transportation\u00a0is\u00a0still\u00a0sometimes the\u00a0only option.\u00a0\"We are seeing cities introduce physical distancing measures,\u00a0both on public transit networks and informal minibus operations where stricter occupancy limits are being set,\" said\u00a0Gunjan Parik,\u00a0an\u00a0urban\u00a0planning\u00a0expert\u00a0at\u00a0 C40 Cities, a network of major\u00a0world\u00a0cities tackling\u00a0climate\u00a0change . To keep people safe, she\u00a0said,\u00a0many cities were\u00a0stepping\u00a0up\u00a0vehicle\u00a0cleaning and disinfection,\u00a0mandating\u00a0face masks\u00a0and\u00a0providing\u00a0hand sanitizer\u00a0on buses, like in Cape Town,\u00a0or\u00a0setting up\u00a0portable\u00a0hand-washing facilities,\u00a0such\u00a0as those in the Rwandan capital, Kigali. Renewed focus on 'active mobility' needed Parik\u00a0pointed out, however, that\u00a0fear of the virus\u00a0could still\u00a0keep people away,\u00a0risking\u00a0the future viability of these services.\u00a0\"It is inevitable that the fear factor of public transport will affect future demand,\" she said.\u00a0And with many transport networks\u00a0reliant on fares to fund operations, new infrastructure and maintenance,\u00a0she said decreasing services could\u00a0\"[create]\u00a0a vicious circle where demand falls further.\" Until recently, the classic old bicycle would have been an obvious option for anyone wanting to get active outdoors. These days, however, there are a number of electric alternatives that require slightly less exertion. But e-bikes and e-scooters aren't always as eco-friendly as you might think, and can cause other problems too. The e-bike, an enhanced bicycle if you will, is probably the best-known electric alternative to regular bikes. The battery motor makes it move faster and is especially helpful on inclines. One problem: Because it makes biking less exhausting, more seniors who would normally not head out into the traffic anymore, ride e-bikes. That has lead to an increase in accidents. Another issue with e-bikes is the battery, the production of which requires a lot of natural resources. E-bikes run on rechargeable lithium batteries. Digging this metal out of the earth is no easy feat and requires large lithium mines. It's also a finite resource. In 2018, the world's remaining lithium reserves were estimated at 53.8 million tons. Electric modes of transportation don't emit CO2, but e-bike batteries have to be charged regularly. The same is true, of course, for batteries of e-scooters, e-skateboards monowheels, hoverboards, \u2026 See a trend there? The demand for electricity is growing and not all of it is met with energy from renewable sources. As companies keep coming up with cool new e-gadgets for us to buy, the number of batteries that need to be charged is likely to keep rising. In addition to regular e-bikes, there are even e-unicycles. Not into peddling? Then how about a hoverboard, inspired by cult classic \"Back to the Future II\"? E-scooters are similar to the scooters you might remember from your childhood. These new ones, however, don't rely exclusively on our feet to propel them forward, but on battery power. That makes them more eco-friendly than vehicles with a combustion engine, but many people only use them to travel the \"last mile\" from a bus stop or car park to wherever they're going. Up until now, zipping along the streets on an e-scooter was illegal in Germany. Because of their little \"engine,\" you'd need certain permits for e-scooters (like a license for a car), but those weren't available. Starting in the summer of 2019, Germans will be allowed to drive e-scooters with a maximum speed of up to 20 kph (12 mph) on bike paths. In the US, that's been legal for a while. Author: Carla Bleiker Mobility expert\u00a0Van Gyzegem\u00a0shares her concern,\u00a0pointing\u00a0out that shared mobility \u2014 cars, bikes and scooters, featured in\u00a0Brussels' strategy\u00a0\u2014 could also take a hit, with users fearing the\u00a0risk of contamination. \"Wouldn't people rather invest in their own bike or scooter, rather than use a shared device?\u00a0None of these services were profitable before COVID-19 \u2014 how will they survive?\"\u00a0he said. \"A renewed focus on active mobility has to form a significant part of the recovery as economic activity increases in cities,\" said\u00a0Parik.\u00a0In a statement\u00a0on May 7, a group of mayors with the C40 COVID-19 Recovery Task Force,\u00a0representing 750 million people in cities on every continent,\u00a0 emphasized that\u00a0initiatives linked to\u00a0climate\u00a0action \u00a0\u2014 including\u00a0funding public transport\u00a0and\u00a0expanding cycling networks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0could \"help accelerate economic recovery and enhance social equity.\" \"Our goal is to build a better, more sustainable, more resilient and fairer society out of the recovery from the\u00a0COVID-19 crisis,\" said the statement, warning that the social and economic effects of the pandemic would be \"felt for years to come.\" Shops across Europe were forced to close their doors to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including this fashion store on Makarios Avenue in downtown Nicosia, Cyprus. A stay-at-home order had been in place on the island since late March. On May 4 President Nicos Anastasiades allowed construction sites and small retail stores to open again. People should be able to move freely again on May 21. People in Portugal are now able to enjoy strolling along the beach again. Under the country's state of emergency, which was introduced on March 18, beaches were shut, along with non-essential businesses and restaurants. People were still able to go outdoors and exercise, but now have more freedom to go to shops and hairdressers. However, face masks are still required in closed spaces. Hairdressers were also allowed to reopen in Greece on May 4, including this salon in Athens. Other businesses to open up after a six-week lockdown include florists, bookstores and other small stores. Restaurants and bars will have to wait until the end of the month. Greeks can also leave their homes without needing a form stating their reason, but face masks are mandatory in public transport. Rules requiring face masks on public transport are now commonplace throughout Europe. In Hungary's capital Budapest, transport workers were offering travelers masks at Nyugati Square. Budapest remains under stricter restrictions than the rest of the country. Other cities can begin to open up some stores, museums and public spaces. Public spaces in Spain had been deserted. For 48 days residents were not allowed to leave their homes except for food, medical reasons, or to walk the dog. Restrictions and social distancing rules are still strict, but people are finally able to go out for exercise. People in the capital Madrid pounced on the opportunity. Italy was also under an extremely strict lockdown, with people only allowed to go out for very limited reasons. But on May 4 it slowly began to allow some people to return to work, under social distancing conditions. Workers at a shoe factory in Castelnuovo Vomano, in Teramo province, have to work wearing face masks and separated by plastic screens. Construction workers can also return to sites. The lifting of restrictions in Italy also allows up to 15 people to attend a funeral, albeit while wearing masks. During its lockdown, Italy banned funerals to stop the spread of COVID-19, which denied many people the chance to say goodbye to loved ones. Austria is making sure 100,000 final-year students are able to return to school before their leavers' exams. Teachers like Richard Fischer in Vienna handed out medical face masks to students before the start of lessons. The country is also allowing people to visit relatives in care homes again. Small shops and other businesses were already allowed to reopen on April 14. In Germany professional footballers have been in training, despite competitions currently being suspended. Like other clubs, Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich have been putting their players through their paces, albeit only in small groups. The Bundesliga is targeting May 15 to restart, the first major European league to do so. Fans won't be allowed into stadiums, however.

Massive forest fires are a common occurrence in the region, but the magnitude of this year's blazes has reached an exceptional level with fears of a long-term effect on the environment. More than 3.2 million hectares (7.9 million acres) were on fire on Monday alone, mainly in the vast regions of Yakutia in the north and Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk in Siberia, authorities said. The fires, triggered by dry thunderstorms in temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), were spread by strong winds, Russia's federal forestry agency said. The picture shows a woman taking part in firefighting exercises for volunteers at the Mechta [Dream] forest summer camp outside Moscow. Russian authorities have been slow to declare emergencies and firefighting efforts have been scaled back over economic concerns. The lackluster response has prompted residents to post pleas for help and demands for action online. The fires could exacerbate climate change, warn experts. Greenpeace says almost 12 million hectares have been burnt this year, causing significant CO2 emissions and reducing the future capacity of forest to absorb the carbon dioxide. Some scientists posted satellite images from NASA showing the clouds of smoke reaching Arctic areas. The smoke from the wildfires has affected not only small settlements, but also major cities in western Siberia and the Altai region as well as the Urals such as Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg, and disrupted air travel.

Inaccessible by air and visited only sporadically by a supply ship, the 3,000-strong community is hoping to save its people and culture from rising tides and increasingly severe storms. The atoll of Ontong Java is a ring of 120 islands located in the western Pacific Ocean - some 500 kilometers (311 miles) north of Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands. One of the world's most remote landmasses, the islands span 1,400 square kilometers. They combine to make up 12 square kilometers of land that sits no more than 3 meters (10 feet) above sea level. If sea levels continue to rise, the Ontong Java atoll will be inundated The people on the Ontong Java atoll have always lived at the mercy of the wind and waves - but the largely subsistence life that has served them for centuries is becoming increasingly untenable. Over past years, islanders have been living with worsening food insecurity, severe coastal erosion and the ever-growing prospect of fleeing to an uncertain future on more elevated islands far across the sea. Not only is the ocean encroaching through high winds and waves - bringing seawater and salt over the land - but due to rising sea levels , seawater is now bubbling through the porous coral soil. \"Like the island is leaking,\" an atoll resident told the photojournalist. All islands are showing signs of major erosion, to the point where some land masses have disappeared completely Islander Chris Keungi is 40, and the son of a former chief. Standing on the southern point of Pelau, the island he and about 600 others call home, he pointed beyond the tip of the island. Although a village once stood there, it is hard to imagine anything other than the seawater currently flowing into the lagoon. \"When I was 10, there were a lot of houses here,\" Keungi said. \"When I came back 10 years later, I saw a lot of changes. Soil erosion had begun to wash away most of the houses that were affected by sea rise,\" Keungi said. Late June 2015, an unprecedented cyclone stormed through Ontong Java, leaving devastation in its wake Rising seas are only one of the threats facing the atoll. At the end of June 2015, Ontong Java was hit by two very large waves on the south side of the southern islands, followed immediately by wind gusts at speeds as high as 125 kilometers per hour - generated by Cyclone Raquel. The island of Luaniua, the largest of the atoll with a permanent population of 2,000, bore the brunt of these extreme weather events, losing more than 80 structures including homes, kitchens and rest houses. The home of Moses Paoa on Luaniua, Ontong Java, was destroyed by Cyclone Raquel When faced with the reality of climate change, Keungi, his family and the rest of the people on the atoll have ever-fewer options. Plans to relocate the Polynesian islanders of Ontong Java to the culturally distinct Melanesian island of Malaita have failed. People on the islands understand the growing need to move - but at the moment, most have no intention of doing so. When that day finally comes, many on the atoll would prefer to move to the island of Santa Isabel, some 300 kilometers to the south. They see Santa Isabel as the best chance of finding a place where they can reestablish themselves, and be welcomed as new arrivals with at least some of their ancient culture and traditions intact. The vibrant culture of Ontong Javans threatens to disappear with their islands In December, the international community will come together in Paris to thrash out a new global accord on climate change. For Pacific islands like Ontong Java, the stakes could not be higher. If negotiations in Paris succeed, and new vigorous rules are created that dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and secure renewed funding to protect those already grappling with the effects of climate change - like Ontong Javans - the meeting may provide a future for such Pacific islanders. Yet, if heavy emitters - including one of the Solomon Islands' closest neighbors, Australia - succeed in watering down the current text and allowing ever more fossil fuels to be exploited and burned, the 3,000 people of Ontong Java will be forced to flee the islands they have called home for generations.  In June and July 2015, non-governmental organization Displacement Solutions sent photojournalist Beni Knight to Ontong Java for two months to document and record the culture, lives and opinions of the people of the atoll. DW publishes the exclusive essay and photos here. Member states of the EU have agreed on a unified bargaining stance for the climate talks in Paris later this year.

{"id": null, "body": "     UN head Antonio Guterres has said the world needs to change its food priorities. Meanwhile, island nations talked of rising sea levels and the US and the EU voiced frustration with Iran over nuclear talks. Food waste creates significant amounts of greenhouse gasses. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0said the world needs to change how it makes, eats and wastes food in comments to the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday. \"The war on our planet must end and food systems can help us build that peace ,\" Guterres told the UN summit in New York. Noting that food systems create one third of greenhouse gases, he said following UN sustainable goals established in 2015 could end hunger and poverty while creating global health and wealth. Guterres called for reform of agricultural subsidies and said food should not be seen \"simply as a commodity to be traded, but as a right that every person shares .\" The World Bank Group, International Food Policy Research Institute and Food and Land Use Coalition laid out plans at the summit to unlock $4.5 trillion (\u20ac3.8 trillion)\u00a0in business opportunities with fairer food systems. After US President Joe Biden announced he would invest $10 billion to end hunger earlier in the week, the Bill Gates Foundation committed $900 million to end malnutrition across the globe on Thursday. Small island nations such as the Marshall Islands and the Maldives could be left underwater by rising sea levels caused by a 2 degree heat change, its leaders said. \"We simply have no higher ground to cede,\" Marshall Islands President David Kabua told leaders in a prerecorded speech on Wednesday. \"The difference between 1.5 degrees and 2 degrees is a death sentence for the Maldives,\" President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih said on Tuesday. The November UN climate conference in Glasgow\u00a0will try to pursue the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to cut global emissions by half for 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Carbon fuel emissions create greenhouse gases that\u00a0erode the ozone layer, contributing to global warming and rising seas as polar ice caps melt. But Guyana President Irfaan Ali said Thursday that large polluters were not delivering on their promises to cut emissions . Ali said their \"deception\" and \"failure\" would \"profit them little to emerge king over a world of dust.\" Both the US and China have pledged more cash to help other countries reduce their carbon footprint. World leaders expressed their concern that worsening environmental issues would provoke further conflict in areas with their own sociopolitical friction. \"Look at almost every place where you see threats to international peace and security today, and you'll find that climate change is making things less peaceful, less secure, and rendering our response even more challenging,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. Despite Russian and Chinese objections to climate change being such a large factor in disturbing global peace, the US highlighted its impact in Syria, Mali, Yemen, South Sudan and Ethiopia . \"We have to stop debating whether the climate crisis belongs in the Security Council,\" Blinken urged, \"and instead ask how the council can leverage its unique powers to tackle the negative impacts of climate on peace and security.'' Guterres said: \"The effects of climate change are particularly profound when they overlap with fragility and past or current conflicts.\" \"And when natural resources like water become scarce because of climate change, grievances and tensions can explode , complicating efforts to prevent conflict and sustain peace.\" The United States and the European Union have told the UN this week that they are getting increasingly frustrated with Iran's unwillingness to revive the 2015 nuclear accord . \"We are very much prepared to return to Vienna and continue the talks,\" said Blinken. The question is whether, and if so when, Iran is prepared to do that.\" Months of talks between European nations and Iran's new foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian have revealed nothing concrete. \"The clock is ticking. We're not going to wait two or three months for the Iranian delegation to come back to the table in Vienna,\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters. \"It has to happen more quickly,\" he added. Iran's foreign ministry said that nuclear talks would resume \"in the coming weeks,\" with new ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi counting the cost of Western sanctions in a recent speech. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told the international community it needs to try not to isolate the Taliban to create a more stable Afghanistan. Qureshi urged for \"an innovative way of engaging\" with the Taliban in an Associated Press interview on Wednesday on the sidelines of the meeting. US and EU powers froze Afghan development aid after the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August . Western nations are still waiting to see if the Taliban will create an inclusive government, preserve women's rights and reject terrorism before working with the insurgent administration. Women's rights have been a prime concern of Western powers in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan Pakistan's foreign minister said his country was ready to play a \"constructive, positive\" role in opening communication with the Taliban because that would be to its benefit too. \"What the international community can do, in my view, is sit together and work out a roadmap,'' Qureshi said. \"If they fulfill those expectations, this is what the international community can do to help them stabilize their economy. This is the humanitarian assistance that can be provided. This is how they can help rebuild Afghanistan, reconstruction and so on and so forth.'' The foreign minister said it was \"a positive sign\" that the law-and-order situation had improved, fighting had stopped and many internally\u00a0displaced Afghans were going home. jc/aw (Reuters, AFP, AP)\n \u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "UN chief urges food systems change amid climate change threat", "article_name": "un-chief-urges-food-systems-change-amid-climate-change-threat", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/un-chief-urges-food-systems-change-amid-climate-change-threat/a-59290123", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 6068, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:36.883263"}
{"id": null, "body": "     A study found that the world lost an area of tropical forest roughly the size of England in 2018, equal to about 30 soccer fields every minute. The implications for efforts to fight global climate change are dire. Humanity destroyed some 12 million hectares (30 million acres) of tropical forest in 2018 \u2014 almost a third of which was pristine rainforest. That was the finding of scientists from Global Forest Watch, whose study, published on Thursday, showed the third-largest decline since global satellite data became available in 2001. Failure to stop tree cover\u00a0loss\u00a0has major implications for climate change, they warned, limiting the ability of the planet to soak up carbon emissions. \"The world's forests are now in the emergency room,\" said Frances Seymour\u00a0from the World Resources Institute, the research organization responsible for the study. Forests absorb about 30 percent of man-made global greenhouse gas emissions \u2014\u00a0just over 11 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Oceans\u00a0soak up the next\u00a0largest portion. Read more: \u00a0 Forest SOS: Earth's green lungs disappear \"The health of the planet is at stake, and band-aid responses are not enough,\" Seymour said. \"With every hectare lost, we are that much closer to the scary scenario of runaway climate change.\" One bright spot A quarter of tropical tree cover loss took place in Brazil alone , with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia both accounting for about 10%. There were also high levels of deforestation in Malaysia and Madagascar. For the first time, researchers were able to calculate the loss of undisturbed natural rainforest using satellite data.\u00a0They found that much of the loss \u2014\u00a0an area about the size of Belgium \u2014\u00a0occurred in primary rainforest,\u00a0with mature trees that absorb more carbon and are harder to replace. Read more:\u00a0 Deforestation triggering natural calamities in Indonesia Almost a third of primary rainforest loss was in Brazil, with DR Congo, Indonesia, Colombia and Bolivia next in line. New deforestation hot spots were revealed, particularly in Africa, where illegal mining, small-scale clearances and cocoa farm expansion led to notable tree loss in countries such as Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Read more: \u00a0 Brazil's Amazon deforestation documented via massive satellite imaging  The study revealed at least one positive. In Indonesia, primary forest loss\u00a0slowed for the second year running, dropping by 63% compared to 2016. This happened after the government imposed a moratorium on forest-clearing. Forests, woods, groves, copses... all of these woodland areas take centre stage on the International Day of Forests on March 21st. The day was proclaimed by the United Nations in 2012. With its annually changing themes, it is all about raising awareness of forests and their diverse uses. This year the theme is \"Forests & Energy.\" Forests are the basis for many types of energy. When used as a fuel, wood can come in handy in solid, gas, and liquid form. Woodfuels such as solid firewood and charcoal, wood gas, and liquid bio-oil or bio-ethanol provide one in three households worldwide with energy. That equals 2.4 billion people globally. Woodfuels' primary domestic uses are cooking, heating and boiling water. Good old forests and the fuels they generate are ancient, yet sustainable sources of energy. They account for approximately 40 percent of our global renewable energies. In contrast to fossil fuels, the emissions that are set free into the atmosphere when burning woodfuels are later removed again when trees are planted, because they make use of and store CO2. About 50 percent of wood is used for energy purposes each year, mostly just burnt for fuel. This percentage rises to 60 percent in Asia and 90 percent in Africa. But the smoke causes problems, particularly for people's health. 4.3 million people die every year because of indoor air pollution. That is more than deaths from malaria, tuberculosis and HIV combined. Woods are an important source of employment. In developing countries, around 883 million people base their livelihoods fully or partly on forests. With new, advanced biofuels picking up, this number could increase - also in developed countries. The popularity of pellets and briquettes has significantly increased over the years - in 2015, 28 million tons were produced. They are not only smaller and easier to handle, they can also be produced from other feedstock, such as grasses or waste-sawdust. Another benefit of the energy carrier: compared to liquid or gas from fossil fuels, pellets are safer to transport. Wood is only good for heat? Not necessarily. With our planet heating up, trees can also act as coolers. In overheated cities, trees can cool their environment down by up to eight degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit). As a consequence, cooler city air requires less energy for air conditioning in buildings. The trees are working their magic again. The rainforest plays a key role in sequestering CO2. The key Amazon rainforest is under threat from deforestation as trees are felled and areas cleared for farming, mining or construction projects. Scientists warn that these forests must be saved if the world's climate is to be protected.

{"id": null, "body": "     The EU is expected to commit to going carbon neutral. But what will net-zero emissions mean in practice? What are negative emissions, and why do we need them? DW unpicks the jargon. With the Paris Agreement in 2015, nearly 200 nations submitted plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Because it was clear, however, that\u00a0these\u00a0measures would not be nearly enough to meet the Paris goals, the agreement stipulated that states would submit commitments to more radical cuts five years later. In the intervening years, storms, floods, drought and forest fires have made climate change a terrifying reality for increasing numbers of people. And last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned of much worse to come if we exceed 1.5 degrees of warming. Read more: \u00a0 IPCC 1.5 C degree report points to high stakes of climate inaction To meet this goal, the IPCC said we must cut emissions to net-zero by 2050. Last November, the European Commission published a \"strategic vision\" to get there, which it's hoped the European Union will adopt at a summit in Brussels on June 20. Read more: \u00a0 EU elections: Wake-up call for centrists amid euroskepticism, climate inaction So what does \"net-zero\" mean? Net-zero means a radical change across the entire economy, doing away with fossil fuels and other sources of emissions wherever possible. For the rest, every ton of CO2 we do emit must be matched by a ton that we remove from the atmosphere. Read more: \u00a0 EU Commission president candidates clash on climate change, migration Which sectors can and can't we \"decarbonize?\" So far, experts say we've done the easy bit: Renewable electricity generated has plummeted in price and is already\u00a0overtaking fossil fuels in some countries. But then things get more complicated, because power that comes and goes with the weather needs to be backed up with something more constant like biofuels \u2014 or nuclear, which the EU strategy expects to generate 15% of our power at net-zero. Read more: \u00a0 Is the IEA underestimating renewables? We will probably also need intelligent grid systems and ways to store electricity, such as giant battery plants. This technology isn't all there yet, but the power sector is still seen as relatively low-hanging fruit. Harder to decarbonize, but to some degree still possible \u2014 with massive deployment of heat pumps and by converting renwable \u00a0power to gas \u2014 are heating, shipping and industrial processes.\u00a0But then there are planes and cows. Renewable-powered flying isn't on the cards yet, and our appetite for beef implies climate-killer methane . With climate concerns growing, many people are trying to reduce their environmental impact. Increasingly, they're turning to plant-based meats \u2014 and investors are taking notice. When Beyond Meat debuted on Wall Street in early May, share prices more than doubled the first day. \"Investors recognize \u2026 a huge business opportunity,\" Bruce Friedrich, director of the Good Food Institute, told AFP. Backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, meat alternatives including Beyond Meat and Impossible Burger, seen here at left, use new food technology and ingredients like peas, fava beans and soy. Unlike earlier veggie burgers, these meatless patties are said to taste, look, smell and even \"bleed\" like real meat (the secret is beet juice). They can also be healthier. But eating less meat isn't just a healthy decision. A 2018 WWF report said cutting animal products from diets would be a \"relatively easy and cheap way\" to fight climate change. A study by the University of Michigan found the Beyond Burger generates 90% less greenhouse gas emissions, requires 46% less energy to produce and has far less of an impact on water scarcity and land use than a beef patty. Beyond Meat is already sold in thousands of US supermarkets and restaurants, and major brands are also looking for a piece of the action. Nestle launched its take on the beef patty in Europe in April, and Unilever took over Dutch plant-based meat producer The Vegetarian Butcher in late 2018. Burger King is rolling out a Beyond Meat option US-wide, and McDonald's is testing its own vegan burger. Industrialized soy crops have been flagged as a contributing factor to widespread deforestation. As Brussels-based environment group Fern points out, more than 1 million square kilometers of land are used to grow soy, almost three times the size of Germany. Only a very small percentag of this, however, is used in meat alternatives. Most goes to animal feed. There are also nutritional concerns about these highly processed foods. Leading brands can have more than double the saturated fat and as much as seven times the amount of sodium as a lean beef burger. And environmental groups are worried about Impossible Burger's inclusion of GMO yeast, which adds a meaty flavor. Excessive consumption has been linked to cancer \u2014 but that goes for real meats too. In Europe, meat alternatives may soon have to be sold as \"discs,\" \"tubes\" and \"slabs\" as opposed to burgers, sausages and steaks. The EU Parliament's agriculture committee has backed a move to ban producers of vegetarian food from using terms that usually describe meat. The full parliament is yet to vote on the measure however. Author: Martin Kuebler What are negative emissions? That's where negative emissions come in. To meet the net-zero target, we will literally have to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere. The obvious way is with trees and plants, which do it anyway. That means turning over vast areas of land to forest and\u00a0wetlands, as well as\u00a0looking at other natural forms of carbon sequestration. One idea is bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS): Energy crops, such as maize, absorb carbon as they grow. We then burn them (generating energy we can use), capturing the carbon they emit, so it can be buried or recycled rather than going back into the atmosphere. But this would require so much agricultural land it could threaten food security.\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 Carbon capture: Expensive, risky \u2013 and indispensable? Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology hasn't progressed much beyond the pilot-project stage, and has mostly been used with fossil fuel power plants or\u00a0to capture industrial emissions. And then there is direct air capture (DACCS), which splits CO2 from the air around us. But it's in even earlier stages of development than CCS. What about carbon offsetting? Leaving carbon capture aside, there is another way to reach the big zero: carbon credits. Rather than a country offsetting emissions it can't \u2014 or won't \u2014 get rid of against carbon sequestered on its own soil, offsetting schemes allow it to pay for things such as\u00a0tree-planting or forest conservation abroad. But the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's REDD+ offset scheme has been criticized for lacking \"environmental integrity\" and violating indigenous land rights. And it obviously doesn't work if every country wants to emit more than their share. Ultimately, offsetting means some countries will have a negative balance \u2014 absorbing more carbon than they emit. Small island nations around the world are already feeling the impact of rising sea levels. And probably none more so than the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, which is considered the lowest-elevation country on the planet. The average elevation of its 26 atolls is just 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level - so it wouldn't take much for the country to be rendered completely uninhabitable. Rising waters have already caused some islanders to flee their homes for higher ground. On the Kiribati islands in the Pacific, some villages have been completely flooded. Local farmers also have to worry about encroachment of saltwater on their crops. The ever-approaching sea means less surface area for agriculture, and a greater need to transport food from afar. Around 113,000 people call the Kiribati islands home. Locals who've been displaced often end up on the main island of South Tarawa, which has a sea wall to protect low-lying properties on the shore from rising waters - but that's no permanent solution. The Dutch are famous for their efforts to fend off the sea - they built their first dikes to protect land from flooding more than 1,000 years ago. Today, a sophisticated system of dams and dikes allows two-thirds of the population live below sea level. Nevertheless, rising ocean levels are still a concern in the Netherlands, where there are future plans to fortify levees and build surge barriers. Venice in northeastern Italy is no stranger to flooding - and according to experts, the iconic city will continue to sink. The Italian government has invested 9.6 billion euros ($7 billion) in the \"Moses\" water barrier project, designed to protect the city - a UNESCO World Heritage site - from rising oceans and high tides. The barriers are expected to be completed by 2016. Many small islands in far-flung corners of the ocean don't have the money to fund large-scale climate change mitigation. And often, they're not just facing rising seas - they're also under threat from increasingly frequent cyclones and hurricanes. In the Caribbean islands of St. Lucia and Dominica, frequent storms wreak havoc on local agriculture, including bananas and avocados. The devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines last November is a clear example of how the unpredictability of climate change can make weather events more severe for islands. Many homes in the typhoon\u2019s path weren\u2019t built to withstand typhoons, which previously tended to strike the north of the country. More than 6,200 people were killed. Some argue that poorer, less-developed countries are now suffering as a consequence of Western industrialization. At the recent climate conference in Warsaw, Philippines Commissioner Yeb Sa\u00f1o made a passionate plea for action, saying: \"What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness.\" Although Bangladesh is on the mainland of Asia, it faces a huge risk from climate change due to its low-lying geography and population density. A mere 1-meter (3-foot) rise in sea level would cause half the country to be under water. Communities have started adapting to increased flooding by using floating agricultural technology to grow their crops. There are fears sea level rises could eventually displace entire populations, creating hoards of climate change refugees. One idea floated by President Anote Tong of Kiribati some years ago was the possibility of building artificial islands for displaced locals to live on. Dubai - with its artificial island projects, like the one pictured here - may be able to help by sharing its experience. Author: Natalie Muller How much traction does net-zero have in EU states? In Europe, Denmark and Norway have enshrined net-zero by 2050 in law, while Sweden's climate legislation commits it to meeting the target by 2045. Still, all three Nordic countries either allow or don't explicitly rule out international carbon offsetting to reach the goal. Countries including France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands are debating similar steps. Read more: \u00a0 Sweden to end net carbon emissions by 2045 Why 2050? The target year of 2050 is a negotiation between the necessary and the possible. The IPCC says if we cut global emissions to net-zero, we can still keep warming below 1.5 degrees. If we end up with net-zero by 2070, we can still hope for no more than 2 degrees.

The European Commission's vision says the 2050 goal will make the EU \"one of the first to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and lead the way the worldwide,\" implying that other countries will be less ambitious, and therefore that the IPCC's global net-zero target will be missed. So, we still have a few decades then? A zero-carbon economy won't be built in a day. The deadline is just over 30 years away. By then, our streets must be cleared of all combustion-engines. The Climate Change Commission advising the UK government says no new petrol and diesel cars should be sold from 2035 at the absolute latest. Meanwhile, several EU countries\u00a0have new fossil-fueled power plants, which have an average lifespan of 50 years, either in planning or\u00a0under construction right now.

But the longer we take to change our systems and behavior, the heavier\u00a0we will rely on the more dubious business of extracting carbon from the atmosphere. Are there more important targets to shoot for? Committing to net-zero makes it clear that cutting emissions isn't enough. It means there's no point in building natural gas infrastructure, for example, even if it would save a lot of emissions from coal. But talking about 2050 might give the impression we can leave the toughest jobs for last, betting on technologies that haven't been invented yet and future generations being able to stomach even more drastic change than we're facing now.

So far, Europe isn't even on track to reach the original goals\u00a0it set back in 2015. Thousands of students walked out of class in Sydney, kicking off global protests on Friday. They got the attention they wanted. Some Australian politicians hit back with criticism. \"For action on issues that they think is important, they should do that after school or on weekends,\" said Education Minister Dan Tehan. Protesters in New Zealand invited adults to join the march. \"If we go on strike on a school day, then they'll notice and they might want to do something,\" said 14-year-old student Inese, who didn't want to give her full name. And her prime minister is listening. Jacinda Ardern supports the strikes and has pledged NZ$100 million (\u20ac60 million/$68 million) to cut greenhouse gases. The movement has snowballed since 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg began skipping school to protest in front of parliament last August. On March 15, her protest spread from Vanuatu to Hong Kong (pictured here), Tashkent to Madagascar. In Thailand, one of the world's top plastic polluters, students campaigned against single-use plastics. From Seoul to Singapore, each city's students spoke out in their own way. Here in South Korea, 100 students held signs saying \"Too warm 4 school\" and \"Don't deny climate change.\" In Singapore, strict laws regulate public assembly so young people planned a virtual campaign on social media. In India, protests were seen in 36 different cities, including New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore. Students in New Delhi chanted slogans demanding the Indian government stop using coal and act against climate change and air pollution. While German Chancellor Angela Merkel has supported the movement, some German students are still afraid to skip school. But not all. Protests were planned for 200 cities across the country. In the German capital, the crowds were huge by midday. In the western German city of Cologne, students braved the wet weather. Massive storms have recently battered that part of the country, though they only appeared to fan the flames of the students' protest. Greta Thunberg (center) led one of the many protests in Sweden. She said she was excited that protests had spread to 2,052 places in 123 countries. Asked if adults should strike too, she replied: \"It's up to them, if they want their kids to have a future.\" Students in South African cities, including Cape Town and Pretoria, joined in the school strike. Africa, with more than 1 billion people, is expected to be hardest hit by global warming even though it contributes the least to greenhouse gas emissions. Strikes were held by students in cities across the country, including New York, Washington, Chicago, Portland, Oregon and St. Paul, Minnesota. In June 2017, US President Donald Trump announced that the US was withdrawing from the 2015 Paris agreement on mitigating climate change. Montreal drew among the largest crowds, estimated by organizers at nearly 150,000. The global movement saw a response from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who said he was inspired by the climate strikers to call a special summit in September to deal with \"the climate emergency.\" Author: Tom Allinson The student environmental activist group has issued a concrete set of demands to German politicians, including a greenhouse gas tax and net-zero emissions by 2035.

{"id": null, "body": "     These five megatrends present major global threats for planet Earth \u2014 problems that must be solved if the world is to remain a supportive habitat for humans and other species. DW looks at causes and possible solutions. 1. Air pollution and climate change. Problem: Overloading of the atmosphere and of ocean waters with carbon. Atmospheric CO2 absorbs and re-emits infrared-wavelength radiation, leading to warmer air, soils, and ocean surface waters - which is good: The planet would be frozen solid without this. Unfortunately, there's now too much carbon in the air. Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation for agriculture, and industrial activities have pushed up atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 280 parts per million (ppm) 200 years ago, to about 400 ppm today. That's an unprecedented rise, in both size and speed. The result: climate disruption . Carbon overloading is only one form of air pollution caused by burning coal, oil, gas and wood. The World Health Organization recently estimated that one in nine deaths in 2012 were attributable to diseases caused by carcinogens and other poisons in polluted air. Solutions: Replace fossil fuels with renewable energy. Reforestation. Reduce emissions from agriculture. Change industrial processes. The good news is that clean energy is abundant - it just needs to be harvested. Many say a 100 percent renewable-energy future is feasible with existing technology now. But the bad news is that even though renewable energy infrastructure - solar panels, wind turbines, energy storage and distribution systems - are already widespread, and getting cheaper and more efficient\u00a0all the time, experts say we're not applying them quickly enough to prevent catastrophic climate disruption. Barriers in policy and finance remain to be overcome. Picture gallery:\u00a0The big smog: Cities plagued by air pollution Ulan Bator is not only one of the coldest capitals on earth, it's also a city with massive air pollution. During the winter months, yurts like Tsegi\u2019s are heated with coal and wood which contributes up to 70 percent of the smog in the city. Air pollution in Ulan Bator is seven times higher than what is considered safe by the WHO. The Chinese capital has been suffering from smog so heavy that scientists say the city is almost uninhabitable - although it is home to 20 million people. Models suggest that 3.5 million people die globally every year because of air pollution - almost half of them in China. Having said this, it might be a surprise to learn that smog is an even bigger problem in other cities across the world. Air pollution is one of Pakistan's main environmental concerns. The situation is particularly dramatic in the country's second largest city, Lahore. The smog is caused primarily by the high volume of road traffic, rubbish incineration and dust from the surrounding deserts. In the nearly 10 million-strong city of New Delhi, the number of cars has increased from 180,000 to 3.5 million in the last 30 years. Still, it's the city's coal powered plants that are causing the biggest problem. They contribute to around 80 percent of the total air pollution in the city. Sandstorms, like here in Riyadh, can contribute to smog forming because they increase the amount of particles in the air. In a place like Saudi Arabia, the intense ultra-violet rays also transform transport and industry emissions into ozone. The poor air quality in Cairo causes a number illnesses among city residents, like chronic respiratory problems and lung cancer. The reason for the air pollution is an increase in road traffic and the booming industrial sector. According to a study by the Max-Planck Institute in Mainz, some 15,000 people die every year in Dhaka due to air pollution. Researchers found the world's highest concentration of sulfur dioxide there. Even if it looks the same the world over, smog is different, depending on the city. Smog in Moscow, for instance, is characterized by high amounts of hydrocarbons. The westerly winds which regularly plow across Moscow mean that the western part of the city generally has better air quality. The smog in Mexico City is made worse by the geographical location. The city is surrounded on three sides by mountains. Due to the high levels of sulfur dioxide and hydrocarbons in the air, Mexico City was long considered one of the most polluted cities in the world. The situation is now improving due to new transport policies and certain factories being shut down. Author: Julia Vergin / al / ms \u00a0 2. Deforestation. Problem: Species-rich wild forests are being destroyed , especially in the tropics, often to make way for cattle ranching, soybean or palm oil plantations, or other agricultural monocultures. Today, about 30 percent of the planet's land area is covered by forests - which is about half as much as before agriculture got started around 11,000 years ago. About 7.3 million hectares (18 million acres) of forest are destroyed each year, mostly in the tropics. Tropical forests used to cover about 15 percent of the planet's land area; they're now down to 6 or 7 percent. Much of this remainder has been degraded by \u00a0logging or burning. Not only do\u00a0natural forests act as biodiversity\u00a0reserves, they are also carbon sinks, keeping carbon out of the atmosphere and oceans. Solutions:  Conserve of what's left of natural forests, and restore degraded areas by replanting with native tree species. This requires strong governance - but many tropical countries are still developing, with increasing populations, uneven rule-of-law, and widespread cronyism and bribery when it comes to allocating land use. Picture gallery:\u00a0Burning down the Amazon In 2013, clearing practices were intensified again in Brazil\u2019s rainforest. At the World Climate Summit in Warsaw, Brazil\u2019s environment minister Izabella Teixeira admitted that by November this year, some 5,843 square kilometers of forest had been cut down. 2012 saw a loss of 4,571 square kilometers. In 2004, some 27,000 square kilometers went up in flames \u2013 a global negative record. Intensified soy and wheat cultivation are partly to blame for the destruction of the rainforest. Brazil\u2019s Para state saw the heaviest clearing. Destruction there rose by 136 percent between August 2012 and June 2013, according to the Imazon Institute. Near the city of Novo Progresso alone, some 400 hectares of forest were torched. Even though only about five percent of Brazil\u2019s 200 million inhabitants live in the Amazon region, dam construction is on the rise there. The Teles Pires hydropower plant on the Amazon tributary of the same name is due to start operation in 2015. So far, only one percent of the region\u2019s hydropower potential is being used. Brazil\u2019s national energy plan foresees a considerable rise by 2030. Once it is cleared, the timber is sold. The illegally cleared areas in the Amazon region are often used by cattle breeders as pasture land. According to Brazilian law, they can become the rightful owners if they use the area \u2018productively\u2019 for five years in a row. The costs of clearing a forested area are estimated at around 3,000 euros (4,040 US dollars) per hectare. This settler has been caught red-handed by the police. He illegally cut down trees in Jamanxim National Park. Brazil\u2019s environment agency, Ibama, regularly patrols the Amazon\u2019s national parks and nature reserves. In 2012, the agency issued fines of roughly half a billion euros. This year, the figure is likely to be even higher. Last year, the Brazilian government announced it would limit the destruction of the rainforest until 2020 to less than 4,000 square kilometers per year by increasing patrols. But an ever-growing number of trees is lost to lumberjacks, gold diggers and agricultural companies. The illegally felled jungle giant pictured here was discovered near the city of Novo Progresso in Jamanxim National Park. The 3,000-kilometer \u2018Transamazonica\u2019 highway was supposed to connect Brazil with its Latin American neighbors, Peru and Bolivia. But forty years after the ground was broken on Brazil\u2019s famous federal highway BR 230, the gigantic project is still not finished. And environmental groups don\u2019t want that to change. Humble bars along the 'Transamazonica,' like this one, are the first port of call for truck drivers and those seeking their luck in the jungle. In the rainy season, the highway often turns into an impassable mud track. Small farmers and gold prospectors have settled along the gash cut through the jungle, pushing out the original inhabitants from their traditional areas of settlement. The gold rush is threatening their lives. Hundreds of Yanomami have died from diseases brought into their areas by prospectors. Settlers invade the area regularly because the Yanomami\u2019s reservation hosts big gold reserves. In June this year, the Brazilian army destroyed illegal airstrips in the nearly 9.5 million hectare reservation on the border with Venezuela. Black gold: In the middle of the 'Alto Rio Guama' reservation, jungle giants like these disappear in round ovens. The illegally felled trees are turned into charcoal. This aerial image was taken from a police helicopter during a patrol in September 2013. The reservation belongs to the 'Nova Esperanca do Piria' community in Brazil's Para state.

At sea, huge industrial fishing boats equipped with bottom-trawling or purse-seine nets clean out entire fish populations. The loss and destruction of habitat are also major factors contributing to a wave of extinction - unprecedented in that it is caused by a single species: humans. The IUCN's Red List of threatened and endangered species continues to grow. Not only do species inherently deserve to exist, they also provide products and \"services\" essential to human survival. Think bees and their pollinating prowess - necessary for growing food. Solutions: Concerted efforts need to be made to prevent further loss of biodiversity. Protecting and restoring habitats is one side of this - protecting against poaching and wildlife trade is another. This should be done in partnership with locals, so that wildlife conservation is in their social and economic interest. Picture gallery:\u00a0Looming extinction crisis \u00a0 The American black bear is one of more than 22,000 species threatened with extinction. During the past century, animals have been disappearing about 100 times faster than they used to, scientists from different American universities warned in a new study. According to the WWF, around 70 species go extinct every day. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - which publishes a \"red list\" of threatened and endangered species - 41 percent of amphibian species and 26 percent of mammals are facing extinction. This Titicaca water frog, found only in Lake Titicaca in South America, used to be present in the millions in the early 1970s. By now, they have disappeared almost completely. The causes of species loss are mostly manmade. They range from climate change, to pollution, to deforestation and beyond. About 2,000 trees have been cut down every minute during the past 40 years, according to a different study. The world is embarking on its sixth mass extinction event, the current study concludes. The modern rate of species loss was compared to \"natural rates of species disappearance before human activity dominated.\" The dodo (pictured above) was pushed to extinction by the introduction of nonnative species in 1690 - only 100 years after it had been discovered on Mauritius. The study is based on documented extinctions of vertebrates - or animals with internal skeletons - from fossil records and other historical data. These results are estimations, since humans don't know exactly what happened throughout the course of Earth's history. In earlier extinction events, such as the Ice Age, only two out of 10,000 mammals died out per century - such as this primordial horse. As species disappear, so do crucial services, such as pollination of crops by honeybees. At the current rate of species loss, humans will lose innumerable biodiversity benefits within three generations, the study's authors write. \"We are sawing off the limb that we are sitting on,\" wrote author Paul Ehrlich from Stanford University. If the current rate of extinction is allowed to continue, \"life would take many millions of years to recover and our species itself would likely disappear early on,\" wrote lead author Gerardo Ceballos of the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico. The study calls for \"rapid, greatly intensified efforts to conserve already threatened species, and to alleviate pressures on their populations - notably habitat loss, over-exploitation for economic gain and climate change.\" In the meantime, the researchers hope their work will contribute to conservation, the maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity-oriented public policy.

Problem: Overgrazing, monoculture planting, erosion, soil compaction, overexposure to pollutants, land-use conversion - there's a long list of ways that soils are being damaged. About 12 million hectares of farmland a year get seriously degraded, according to UN estimates. Solutions: A wide range of soil conservation and restoration techniques exist, from no-till agriculture to crop rotation to water-retention through terrace-building. Given that food security depends on keeping soils in good condition, we're likely master this challenge in the long run. Whether this will be done in a way equitable to all people around the globe, remains an open question. Picture gallery:\u00a0When the earth turns to dust \u00a0 The number of organisms living in a handful of soil outnumber all humans on the planet. They ensure that the humus layer stores nutrients and water. After oceans, soils represent the planet's largest carbon bank. Soils store more carbon than all the world's forests combined. As cities around the world expand, fertile land is disappearing under concrete and asphalt. Microorganisms are suffocated under this artificial surface, and above it rainwater flows away rather than seeping into the soil. Like human skin, the Earth's sensitive surface needs protection from the sun, wind and cold. Large areas can dry out, and ploughing can dislodge the top layer so that it is blown away by the wind. Depletion of the soil through deforestation, over-fertilization and overgrazing can turn land into desert. Climatic factors like drought become a catalyst in a chain reaction - that is set in motion by human activity. Monoculture plantations need large amounts of fertilizer and pesticides to remain productive. Some types of pesticides also harm the natural soil biota, reducing the soil's fertility. Whether resulting from industrial leakage, disaster or weapons, or from years of over-fertilization: once soil is contaminated, fixing the damage is costly and time-consuming. According to official sources in China, nearly one-fifth of agricultural land there is contaminated. The earth is also dug up to get to raw materials. This photo from Germany shows how brown coal mining strips away the topsoil. Through resource extraction, land that could provide wildlife habitat, or be used for agriculture or human habitation, is lost. It takes 2,000 years for nature to produce a 10-centimeter (4-inch) layer of fertile soil that holds water and nutrients, and where plants can grow. To protect fertile soils worldwide, the United Nations has declared 2015 International Year of Soils. Author: Helle Jeppesen / rr 5. Overpopulation. Problem: Human population continues to grow rapidly worldwide. Humanity entered the 20th century with 1.6 billion people; right now, we're about 7.5 billion. Estimates put us at nearly 10 billion by 2050. Growing global populations, combined with growing affluence, is putting ever greater pressure on essential natural resources, like water . Most of the growth is happening on the African continent, and in southern and eastern Asia. Solutions: Experience has shown that when women are empowered to control their own reproduction, and gain access to education and basic social services , the average number of births per woman drops precipitously. Done right, networked aid systems could bring women out of extreme poverty, even in countries where state-level governance remains abysmal. Picture gallery: Remember when we used just one earth? In 1970, 3.7 billion people lived on the planet. Our numbers today exceed 7.5 billion. China and India top the global population list, with 1.4 billion and 1.33 billion inhabitants respectively. (Source: Statista, Deutsche Stiftung Weltbev\u00f6lkerung) About 64 percent of the world's population were rural dwellers in 1970. That's changed drastically. In 2016, the proportion had dropped to 45 percent. (Source: WorldBank) We are becoming city people instead. The number of us living in urban areas rose from 1.34 billion in 1970 to 4 billion in 2016. According to the latest estimates, the majority of us are living in urban areas even in less developed countries. (Source: WorldBank) People love cars, right? But do you know how many there are today? The exact figure is hard to come by but estimations draw a relatively a clear picture. In 1970, 250 million cars were on the road worldwide. That number shot up to 1 billion in 2010 and will have skyrocketed to 2 billion by 2020. The figures include cars, all kinds of trucks as well as buses. (Source: Wikipedia) In 1970, the first Boeing 747 began its passenger service, flying 324 passengers from New York to London. Those 324 people were among the 310 million passengers who flew that year. Around 3.7 billion people took to the skies 2016. (Source: Worldbank) Do you ever think about oil? Well, there's still plenty in the ground and we should keep it there if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change. But we actually put a lot of effort into getting the black gold out instead. Crude oil production has nearly doubled from 48,000 barrels a day in 1970 to 92,000 barrels in 2016. (Source: Statista) Whatever we do, we create carbon emissions. And - rather unsurprisingly - we create a lot. Back in 1970, the world's population exhaled about 14.4 billion tons of CO2. In 2015, we breathed out about 35 billion tons. (Source: Statista) The Amazon is one of the most precious and impressive rainforests on Earth. It's described as the world's green lung because it sucks up so much carbon dioxide. But mankind uses lots of wood and the lung is shrinking. Its area fell from 4,100,000 square kilometers in 1970 to 3,300,000 square kilometers in 2016. In other words, 81 percent of 1970's forest cover still remains.

{"id": null, "body": "     If you want to save the world, go veggie seems to be the motto. But even though dietary decisions are proven to reduce CO2 emissions, young Germans are still eating a lot of meat. To recognize lifestyle trends, take a look at the stock market. After going public in May 2019, a company in the US named \"Beyond Meat\" spiked. Are burgers made from pea protein in high demand \u2014\u00a0or are investors factoring in a new, meat-free era? Recognizing a good business model, German discount supermarket chains stock their shelves with their own veggie products and see those shelves quickly emptied. An astonishing number of food products bear the \"vegan\" imprimatur, including apple juice, wine, nuts and baking chocolate. That may astonish meat-consuming laypersons: in those foods, where's the beef? But vegans in the know will tell you that many flora foods also contain traces of fauna: for example, the gelatin\u00a0used to clarify wine. The advent of the \"Big Vegan TS\" burger in April 2019 in Germany, marketed by a US fast food chain, shows that veganism is not just tolerated. It's going\u00a0mainstream. Read more:\u00a0 Poor eating habits killing millions With everything from meat contamination scandals to concerns about agriculture's climate change impact in the news these days, more and more people are turning to a vegan diet. But, there are other ways to eat in an environmentally-friendly way too. Free-range meat products are now commonplace. Rarely, though, are cows raised in such a paradise as this alpine meadow. In the 1970s and 80s, eating vegetarian, and especially vegan \u2014 abstaining from animal products completely, like milk and eggs \u2014 was not part of the mainstream. Nowadays, things are changing. Jonathan Safran Foer's book \"Eating Animals\" sparked thought about the meat people eat. More vegan restaurants are sprouting up all over the place; here are some dishes from 'P\u00eale-M\u00eale' in Berlin. Eating vegan can reduce carbon footprints and water usage worldwide. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the meat industry generates nearly one-fifth of human-made greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Scientists also say that 13,000 to 15,000 liters of water are needed to produce just one kilogram of beef. With the recent scandal surrounding Dutch horsemeat being sold as beef, more Europeans are now simply choosing to eat meat less. But, for those that can't do without, the \"Meine kleine Farm\" (My little farm) concept tries to achieve transparency with consumers. It aims to give each animal it sells as meat a proper identity. The Potsdam-based farm has a website showing the living conditions of the animals and giving customers a chance to vote online about which animal they want slaughtered next. Since they mainly sell to customers in the nearby region, the 'Meine kleine Farm' project also helps to keep transportation routes \u2014 and thus greenhouse gases \u2014 to a minimum. Eating locally and in season also helps reduce greenhouse gases because it cuts out long transportation routes. Canadians Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon argued for local cuisine in their book, \"100-mile diet: A year of local eating.\" The couple spent one year eating foods from within one hundred miles of their home. Self-preserved foods got them through the winter. The modern industrial agriculture practice of cultivating monocultures, such as corn and soy, can make the crops more susceptible to pests and diseases. This, in turn, promotes the widespread use of pesticides. Small-scale farmers, on the other hand, often promote crop diversity which makes plants naturally more robust, even in periods of drought. Cultivating one's own crops is possible even in big cities, as shown by the \"Princess Garden\" project right in the middle of Germany's capital, Berlin. Crops are grown and consumed locally, with food dishes offered as business lunches at an on-site caf\u00e9. The urban farmers here say gardening raises awareness about the environment and, since the garden is shared, they make friends along the way too. With Germans throwing away an estimated 20 million tons of food a year, food-sharing has become one of the latest environmentally-friendly trends. Restaurants or grocery stores donate still-edible food that they can no longer use to charity organizations. Foodsharing.de is an internet portal where people can swap food they won't be able to eat. Many dietary experts argue that a vegetarian or vegan diet can be good for your health too. Various studies show that a decrease in daily meat consumption may reduce the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Author: Louisa Schaefer It's about where it comes from Driven by the ongoing issue of climate change, that lifestyle is trending upwards. Week after week, students in \"Fridays for Future\" demonstrate for environmental protection. The most essential measures towards reducing CO2 \u00a0emissions must be taken by public policy and industry, but Greta Thunberg, the movement's initiator, says that responsibility for the planet begins with personal decisions: no meat, no air travel, no plastic. But does the climate actually benefit from these honorable motives? Under certain conditions, yes, says Felix Olschewski, cookbook author and blogger on Urgeschmack.de (the page translates as \"original taste\"). But in many cases, not. \"If you care about the climate, you have to ask first: Where's my food coming from?\" A cow on forest-cleared land in Argentina fed soy grown in monocultures and transported to Germany on a freight ship will of course leave a bigger carbon footprint than a locally-grown one. All the more so if the latter, nourished on land unsuitable for cultivation and without agricultural products, makes its own contribution to sustainable grasslands. Even climate-damaging gasses that land-nourished animals emit during digestion enter a natural cycle. The book author himself eats climate-neutral, refusing bananas and coconut oil. Both are vegan, but long-distance transport gives them a negative climate factor.\u00a0 Seal of approval: the food industry goes vegan There are 1.3 million vegans in Germany. In a country of 83\u00a0million residents, that's an insignificant number for marketing considerations, but the number of hobby vegans and flexitarians who occasionally purchase vegan or vegetarian foods is much larger. It's cool to go without. According to an opinion survey published by \"YouGov,\" 63 percent of Germans want to reduce their meat consumption. The \"vegan\" label, not long ago a symbol of otherworldly ecofreaks, is now synonymous for \"healthy\" and \"climate-friendly\": attractive marketing pitches for any food manufacturer. Read the fine print, however, and the picture is less clear. \"Many products have a such a long list of additives that you can't read them all on the way home,\" says Olschewski. Looks like meat, but it ain't That hasn't (yet) reduced the popularity of these products according to marketing research institute Nielsen, which determined that sales of vegan and vegetarian foods have been increased by 30% every year since 2008. Germany, the land of wurst Germany is actually a leader in introducing new products. According to the opinion researcher Mintel, the number of new vegan products is three times higher than in 2013. Fifteen percent of all new products worldwide \u2014\u00a0vegan liverwurst for example \u2014\u00a0originate in Germany. On the subject of vegan wurst products: the market leader far-and-away, as determined by Statista, is a big company named R\u00fcgenwalder M\u00fchle. A climate-conscious consumer who buys alternative meat substitutes sold under this label is bolstering the profit margin of a company that largely manufactures conventional, mass-produced and processed meat products. However, the National Association of the German Meat Industry registers no dent in the demand for meat. One surprising statistic: \"Meat sales are on the rise \u2014\u00a0particularly among young consumers,\" says managing director Thomas Vogelsang. When at the supermarket, the stomach and the head seem to go different ways: \"Many consumers answer polls one way and then buy something else,\" he explains. At the BBQ Championship in Fulda, professionals grill every season for top honors This consumer behavior isn't likely to change soon. \"It's like a steamer. It changes direction very slowly,\" says Vogelsang. It's also a matter of perspective. An upward tick is registered by both top-quality \"Dry Aged Beef\" and the burger joints that keep popping up in big German cities. \"Take a look around home supplies stores, and you'll see one barbecue\u00a0grill larger than the other. A giant grill that can accommodate two hundred pounds of meat and takes up the whole terrace is a status symbol nowadays,\" adds Vogelsang. How to protect the climate? It's a complex issue. Climate researchers continue to urge consumers to make discerning purchases and to opt out of meat. A study conducted by Oxford University in Great Britain indicates that one-fourth of global greenhouse gas emissions is caused by food production, and 80% of that results from animals. Read more:\u00a0 Snack bar culture in Germany The average German generates 11 tons of annual CO2 emissions, but if exclusively plant-based food is consumed, it is estimated to be only nine tons. \"Going vegan is probably the biggest handle an individual\u00a0has on reducing his ecological footprint,\" explained Oxford scientist Joseph Poore in the German newsweekly Der Spiegel . \"The benefit is far greater than buying an electric car or flying less.\" The current special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also recommends sharply reducing meat consumption. That doesn't mean bending over backwards however, the report said: \"We don't have to decline all animal products but should return to the principle of the Sunday roast,\" says Alexander Popp, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute of Research into the Consequences of Climate Change and a co-author of the IPCC report. Worldwide meat production per capita has more than doubled. Equally astonishing is the waste of food products, with up to 30% of total global food production thrown away. Soy monoculture destroys the Amazon forest \u2014 and between 70-90% of it is used as animal feed Using arable land to nourish the world's population has grown out of proportion. Researchers for the IPCC report urgently recommend a more sustainable and conservational use of shrinking spaces, be it to sustain animals or for soybean monocultures \u2014 which are mainly grown to feed livestock.\u00a0 What's good for nourishment and for the climate cannot be determined by the food industry, a vegan seal or a lifestyle trend. A veggie burger wrapped in triple layers of plastic or kept edible only with chemical additives can possibly score lower on the eco-friendly scale than wild meat at an outdoor market. \u00a0 As we learn how climate change leaves our food security \u2014 and us \u2014 hanging in the balance, it's time to stop behaving as though the planet were an endless store of goodies, says DW's Tamsin Walker.

{"id": null, "body": "     African ranchers are forced to seek new pastures after traditional grazing lands have dried up, putting them on a collision course with local farmers. In some areas, lands previously herded are being used for farming. In mid-October, people in the central Nigerian village of Nkyie Doghwro desperately sought shelter in a schoolhouse. Yet they did so in vain. Ultimately, 29 of them lost their lives, as they were\u00a0the victims of an ongoing conflict between ranchers and farmers in the region. Over the last 15 years more than 60,000 people have died in this forgotten conflict \u2013 almost four times as many as have been killed by the terror group Boko Haram. Conflict between ranchers and farmers is a classic motif in Hollywood westerns. But conflict is also very much part of everyday life in many African nations \u2013 and the reality of it is far more brutal than that which is portrayed on the silver screen. Such conflict becomes unavoidable when ranchers seek new pastures after traditional grazing lands dry up, just as it does when climate change forces farmers to plant in areas where cattle had previously been herded. Such conflicts feature in this year's edition of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's (SIPRI) annual report. Read more:\u00a0 Climate change burden unfairly borne by world's poorest countries Farmers in Nigeria are having increasing difficulty finding enough land to graze cattle In an interview with DW, SIPRI director Dan Smith stressed the link between climate change and security: \"The effects of climate change, alongside other social, economic and political components, contribute to the violence with which conflicts are resolved.\"\u00a0\u00a0 In 2012, several agencies within the United States' intelligence community prepared a report that predicted: \"Many countries that are of strategic importance to the USA will suffer water shortages or flooding over the next 10 years.\" The report added that such situations would increase the risk of instability or even lead to failed state status as well as contributing to regional conflict. Climate change as a threat magnifier That said, one cannot draw a direct connection between climate change and violent conflict, as the causes that lead to bloody conflict are often too complex to allow such mapping. Therefore, it is perhaps more helpful to think of climate change as a threat amplifier. That is how Rob van Riet of the World Future Council describes the relationship between climate and conflict. Van Riet expanded on that thought when speaking with DW: \"Existing threats \u2013 like resource shortages, poverty, famine, terrorism or extreme ideology \u2013 are only amplified by climate change.\" Read more:\u00a0 'Climate change allows terrorists to thrive' Water scarcity and food expense in Syria added to social chaos and fulled the conflict SIPRI's Dan Smith also warns that the effects of climate change \u2013 from droughts to floods \u2013 are not simply local phenomena. He points out that extreme weather situations affect global food prices, and that those rising prices also fuel conflict. \"Whenever global food prices go up we see demonstrations, rioting and ultimately lasting social and political instability in 30 or 40 countries at the same time,\" the SIPRI director observed. When asked which regions most clearly illustrated that relationship, Smith pointed to North Africa and the Middle East: \"Climate change can be clearly recognized within the complex mosaic of causes of conflict in Syria, Egypt and Yemen.\" Rob van Riet also sees Syria as a prime example of climate change as a driver of conflict. In the mid-2000s, large numbers of farmers were forced to give up their livelihood and move to already hopelessly overpopulated cities as a result of the worst droughts the country had ever seen. \"Water became scarce and food expensive. The resulting suffering and social chaos added to ongoing conflicts that eventually spun out of control and ultimately led to the conflict that we are witnessing today,\" says the World Future Council climate expert. Flooding in Karachi, Pakistan Rob van Riet is also gravely concerned about how nuclear powers like Pakistan will deal with the effects of climate change. He says that Pakistan is especially vulnerable, which can be seen in the massive flooding that takes place there annually. \"Beyond the fact that such floods immediately deprive people of their livelihoods, they also have a direct influence on nuclear security,\" emphasized van Riet in a DW interview. Fleeing from a changing environment The Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya houses almost 250,000 people It is clear that the economic effects of climate change are dramatic, and that social effects are as well. The Berlin-based Mercator Research Institute on Climate Change (MCC) is currently analyzing the scope of economic damages caused by climate change. Matthias Kalkuhl, who heads MCC's working group on economic growth and human change, is closely studying 1,400 regions around the world, and told DW: \"On average, about 10 percent of a region's economic output \u2013 and up to 20 percent in tropical counties \u2013 is lost to sinking agricultural and labor productivity caused by climate change \u2013 those are substantial numbers!\" And Kalkuhl did not factor damages from extreme weather catastrophes such as hurricanes or long-term issues such as rising sea levels into the equation. Read more:\u00a0 Conflict as Lake Chad vanishes When entire regions become impoverished it can lead to mass migration, which can, in turn, lead to increased tensions within a country or even beyond its borders. Speaking with DW, Kalkuhl points back to the discussions that accompanied the refugee debate in Germany when\u00a0\"roughly a million people arrived here within a relatively short period of time, throwing the political system into chaos. Therefore, it is very hard to predict how societies will cope with mass population movements.\" Right-wing extremism in Germany has risen since the influx of refugees in 2015 So what can be done? The question grows even more complex due to the fact that, in a best case scenario, it would take\u00a0decades to asses\u00a0the effects of intelligent climate policy. Will we even see such measures enacted?\u00a0SIPRI director Dan Smith thinks that an institution serving under the aegis of the United Nations is what is needed. The institution, he says, would be tasked with assessing security risks. It would then pass its findings on to other UN organizations such as the Security Council, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs or the World Food Program. \"In one way or another, these organizations will all be affected by climate change related security risks over the next several years,\" says Smith.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate change: A catalyst for conflict", "article_name": "climate-change-a-catalyst-for-conflict", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-a-catalyst-for-conflict/a-41245925", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 6817, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:39.854624"}
{"id": null, "body": "     The research group SIPRI has identified a link between climate change and extremism in the West African country. As the region reels from the sudden death of Western-backed strongman Idriss Deby, instability is rife. Many Malians have been forced to flee their lands as climate change and insecurity take their toll A new report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has detailed how environmental changes, including limited land, freshwater and other natural resources, are at least partly\u00a0driving the growth of extremist groups operating in Mali. \"The effects of climate change make peacebuilding more difficult,\"\u00a0Farah Hegazi, from SIPRI's\u00a0Climate Change and Risk Program, told DW. \"When climate change has a negative impact on agriculture, for instance, it means people's income goes down.\" With most Malians relying on natural resources for their livelihoods, a lack of\u00a0economic alternatives in some areas means other actors, such as extremist groups, are more likely to step in and offer false promises. The Lake Chad basin is a vital water source in the Sahel \"There seems to be a relationship between child recruitment and scarce rainfall in central Mali,\" explains Hegazi. \"Families send their children to armed groups as a form of income. When there is more rainfall, there is noticeably\u00a0less recruitment into armed groups.\" While SIPRI's report focused on Mali, the effects of climate change also transcend national boundaries across the Sahel. \"Lake Chad used to provide\u00a0opportunities for communities that depended on fishing for their well-being,\" Christopher Fomunyoh, the Senior Associate for Africa and Regional Director at the National Democratic Institute (NDI) for International Affairs in Washington, D.C. told DW.\u00a0 \"When you visit the Sahel and Lake Chad, you can't not come to the conclusion that climate change is an existential threat to sizeable populations that live in this area.\" Weak governance has significantly compounded these challenges, undermining human security and amplifying local grievances.\u00a0 \"Climate change interacts with other socio-economic factors, which makes peace and security more challenging,\" explains Hegazi.\u00a0 The SIPRI report\u00a0focused\u00a0on the multilateral deployment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). The peacekeeping mission was\u00a0established in 2013\u00a0in the wake of the Tuareg rebellion \u00a0to\u00a0bolster the government and neutralize extemist groups which are heavily involved in organized crime and human trafficking. The mission\u00a0is considered a priority due to its impact beyond Mali's borders, with its mandate due to expire in June. The UN's MINUSMA in Mali is a long battle against several islamic groups in the Sahel With the Malian government still struggling to retain\u00a0control in the northern part of the country, the introduction of new policies to combat the impact of climate change, such as alternative job creation, is\u00a0being hindered. \"There are are few opportunities for Malians to engage in economic activites apart from pastoralism, which has\u00a0led to many taking part in illicit activities such as trafficking,\" Hegazi says. With no solutions to the decreasing water supply and lack of arable\u00a0land, communities across the Sahel are being forced to migrate in search of better livelihoods. This has also led to an\u00a0increase in intercommunal-conflict, as rival\u00a0groups come into contact with one another more frequently. \"We're seeing that across northern Nigeria, there are herder-farmer tensions and skirmishes,\" says Fumonyoh. Another factor at play is the type of support Sahel countries have received from\u00a0 Western states . While France has long been a major player in the region due to its former colonial ties, multilateral efforts such as the G5 Sahel and other counter-terrorism operations have also recieved significant international funding. Problems in the Sahel have brought European and African leaders together: solving the challenges has proved much harder Speaking in the wake of Chadian leader and France ally Idriss Deby's death at the hands of rebels disgruntled at his regime,\u00a0Fomonyoh says the event should serve\u00a0as wake-up call to Western nations operating in the Sahel to better deal with the reality\u00a0on the ground. \"A number of the Sahel countries and their populations face multiple challenges and true partners should be ready to assist those countries deal with those challenges.\" Fomunyoh also says Western allies need to look beyond their own interests if the situation in the region has any hope of improving. \"You can't be a major power and be a partner just because you're interested in natural resources,\" he explains.\u00a0\"At the same time, you cannot neglect climate change or issues of governance that arise with members of the partnerships that you develop.\" A number of environmental initiatives have taken off in the Sahel, including the\u00a0 Great Green Wall initiative, which aims to stop desertification and make soil arable again by replanting swathes of land. It also aims to\u00a0create millions of so-called green\u00a0jobs. The Great Green Wall, meant to stop desertification in the Sahel, is way behind schedule in critical regions like Mali and Bukina Faso But these\u00a0intiatives are particularly difficult to pull off in conflict-ridden areas\u00a0and sustainable funding still remains elusive. MINUSMA has its own Environment and Culture Unit.\u00a0But\u00a0according to SIPRI, it does not focus on climate risks as a priority\u00a0and the mission lacks capacity to address these problems.\u00a0 Fomunyoh adds that when Western partners complain about migration to Europe, Sahel states \"think they're so self-interested that they don't care about the interests of local populations or their permanenliving conditions on a permanent basis.\" \"If the European Union (EU) and European countries want collaboration and cooperation with Africa and Africans, they have to take a holistic approach and make sure that it's not lopsided and not solely focused on\u00a0natural resources.\" Since 1999, the UN has been trying to pacify the eastern region of the DR Congo. The mission known as MONUSCO has nearly 20,000 soldiers and an annual budget of $1.4 billion (1.3 billion euros). Despite being the largest and most expensive mission of the United Nations, violence in the country continues. UNAMID is a joint mission of the African Union and the UN in Sudan's volatile Darfur region. Observers consider the mission a failure. \"The UN Security Council should work harder at finding political solutions, rather than spending money for the military's long-term deployment,\" says security expert Thierry Vircoulon. Since the beginning of South Sudan's civil war in 2013, nearly 4 million people have been displaced according to the UN. Some of them are being sheltered in UN compounds. But when clashes between government forces and rebels broke out in the capital Juba in July 2016, the blue helmets failed to effectively intervene. Later, the Kenyan UNMISS commander was sacked by former UN chief Ban Ki-moon. UN peacekeepers in Mali are monitoring compliance with the peace agreement between the government and an alliance of Tuareg-led rebels. But Islamist terrorist groups such as AQIM continue to carry out attacks making MINUSMA one of the UN's most dangerous military intervention in the world. Germany has deployed more than 700 soldiers as well as helicopters. MINUSCA, the UN's mission in Central Africa Republic has not helped to improve the image of the United Nations in Africa. French troops have been accused of sexually abusing children by the Code Blue Campaign. Three years on, victims haven't got any help from the UN. Since 2014, 10,000 soldiers and 1,800 police officers have been deployed. Violence in the country has receded but tensions remain. The UN mission in the Westsahara known as MINURSO has been active since 1991. MINURSO is there to monitor the armistice between Morocco and the rebels of the \"Frente Polisario\" who are fighting for the independence of the Western Sahara. In 2016, Morocco which has occupied this territory since 1976, dismissed 84 MINURSO staff after being angered by a statement from the UN Secretary-General. The UN mission in Ivory Coast fulfilled its objectives on June 30, 2016 after 14 years. Since 2016, the troops have been gradually withdrawn. Former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said this was a \"turning point for the United Nations and the Ivory Coast.\" But only after the full withdrawal will it be clearly known whether or not the mission was successful on a long-term basis. The UN deployment in Liberia is - as in neighboring Ivory Coast - will soon be history. The soldiers are leaving by mid-2017. Since the end of the 14-year civil war, UNMIL has ensured stability in Liberia and helped build a functioning state. Liberia's government now wants to provide security for itself. The country is still struggling with the consequences of a devastating Ebola epidemic. The UNISFA soldiers are patrolling the disputed oil-rich region of Abyei. Sudan and South Sudan both claim to be rightful owners of this territory located between the two countries. More than 4,000 blue helmets from Ethiopia are deployed. Ethiopia is the world's second largest peace-keeping contributor. At the same time, the Ethiopian army is accused of human rights violations back home. UN peacekeepers in Somalia are fighting under the leadership of the African Union in a mission known as AMISOM. The soldiers are in the Horn of African country to battle the al-Shabaab Islamists and bring stability to the war-torn nation. Ethiopia, Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya and Uganda, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria have all contributed their troops for AMISOM.

{"id": null, "body": "     Isaac and Hasnaa are both in their late 20s and they are both passionate about the world they live in. But there's one fundamental difference. Isaac is a climate change skeptic and Hasnaa believes it's happening. The debate over climate change is everywhere. It's in the newspapers we read, on the TV shows that we watch and it's happening all around us. But while many people generally agree that the global temperature is rising, what is more contentious are the reasons why. Life Links spoke to two young people to find out their views: Isaac Orr is a climate change skeptic. It's something that used to drive his ex-girlfriend nuts, he says. He believes that global warming is to with normal fluctuations in the earth's temperature, irrespective of CO2. The 27-year-old also thinks that the use of fossil fuels just makes economic sense. Isaac is a research fellow at the Heartland Institute, a US-based think tank that ran a counter event to the COP21 Paris Climate Conference. Hasnaa Benlafkih believes that climate change is manmade and that something needs to be done to stop it. The 26-year-old is a program manager with the Global Diversity Foundation, which works to \u201cprotect biocultural diversity and enhance socio-ecological well-being.\u201d She organizes workshops and extracurricular activities for young girls from underprivileged rural areas with the aim to foster environmental stewardship particularly the importance of conserving biodiversity in the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco.   Why do you think climate change is happening?  Hasnaa : It\u2019s happening because our economies are dependent on spewing out a lot of pollutants and greenhouse gases into the environment. Climate change is the by-product of a dysfunctional economic system.  Isaac : I studied geology in college so I feel like I have a comprehensive view of the temperature record that the earth has had over the last 4.6 billion years and there\u2019s always been a lot of variation \u2013 there have been periods where we've had higher CO2 concentrations, and lower temperatures. There are a lot of feedback mechanisms, so as the ocean changes temperature it can either hold more or less CO2. So it\u2019s one of those things where I don\u2019t think the jury is out. I think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.   What are the biggest problems as a result of climate change?  Hasnaa : I think climate change will exacerbate social justice issues and income disparity. There are already problems with the refugee crisis in Europe, but if climate change worsens then the world will have to brace itself for climate refugees. Climate change will cause droughts and rising sea levels that will displace people. It will increase the likelihood of political and social upheaval and also terrorist and extremist groups. It has ramifications that are widespread and unpredictable.  Isaac : It's not to say that we're not having an impact on the climate, because I think we are having some impact. But how sensitive is the global atmosphere and temperature to our carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions? I just don't think they're necessarily as big a factor as some people say they are.    What are the effects of climate change or the climate change debate where you live?  Isaac : [Trying to mitigate climate change] is just one of those things where these regulations have to have large implications on the prices of electricity and that\u2019s going to affect people. That\u2019s less money that you can put towards other things. I\u2019m not a fan of saying that I\u2019m going to take this money and spend it on this, but if you\u2019re going to spend it on something, I think a lot more people die of heart disease, cancer every year. We might do a better service to the world by figuring out that stuff first. I just don\u2019t think that the amount of global warming that we\u2019re going to be able to prevent with these types of measures is going to be significant enough that it\u2019s our best use of money.  Hasnaa : Morocco has gone through periods of drought. Subsistence farming is getting pushed out because it is dependent on rainfall. In Islam there is a special prayer for rain that is only used when the country is desperate for rain and they are performing it here in Morocco on Friday.  The issues of climate change and conservation are related. In the Ourika Valley many people make a living by collecting medicinal plants or working for businesses in the cosmetic and food industry that depend on aromatic plants. But biodiversity conservation is also important because many plants have cultural functions and when they disappear, there is a part of cultural heritage and identity that are lost with them.   What do you think about alternative energies?  Hasnaa : I think they are an important factor in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. We can no longer be dependent on fossil fuels both because of the harm they are doing to the planet, but also for social and political reasons. The sooner we wean our economy off the carbon intensive energy resources, the faster we move towards less income disparity and lessen the power of undemocratic governments. But it\u2019s not just our dependence on nonrenewable sources of energy that needs to change, it\u2019s also the way we plan and build our cities and our consumer lifestyles among other things. In Morocco, we are reliant on fossil fuels. But Morocco is working on improving that with, for example, a huge solar panel farm, which is a would be a first in the region.  Isaac : We\u2019ve been thinking that we were going to run out of fossil fuels for a really long time. For me, I think it\u2019s about technology and the ability to get oil out of the ground. At some point we might get to the point where we don\u2019t have the technology to get more fossil fuels out of the ground, but at that point it becomes cost competitive for wind and solar and nuclear to get into the market naturally. So I think it [investing in renewable energy] is just a little premature right now and maybe we\u2019ll find something else completely. For me it's about promoting the most cost effective way of going about it, energizing our society.   What about more controversial methods like fracking?  Hasnaa : It is not an issue in Morocco. Fracking is terrible for the environment particularly our water systems. It\u2019s not even a necessarily economically viable option because the price of oil fluctuates and it is definitely not viable when one takes into account how detrimental it is to our planet and health.  Isaac : Even when I write about fracking, I don\u2019t say it\u2019s the best thing since sliced bread. I say, you know, this is really good for us right now. It\u2019s really important. There are certain drawbacks and risks to the environment, but if we can mitigate these in a way that\u2019s satisfactory then I think the benefits outweigh the costs, so that\u2019s how I like to look at everything. I don\u2019t like to gloss over the bad parts, because I think that really diminishes credibility. But I think it can be done in an environmentally responsible way. A lot of the impacts are the same as conventional oil and natural gas development and honestly if you want to live in a society where you can drive your car, have a house that's heated and you enjoy abundant electricity, there are certain trade offs that you need to make.   What do people in the country where you live think about the environment?  Hasnaa : Most people in Morocco have a small carbon footprint in comparison to people in the developed world. Their standard of living is not as consumerist. But many people who are becoming more environmentally aware. Although they may not call it climate change, there is a sensitivity and awareness to the changes happening in the environment particularly in communities whose livelihoods and culture depend on nature.  Isaac : I think it\u2019s the generally impression that Europe tends to be a lot more green-minded or at least more concerned about carbon dioxide emissions than we are in the United States, but there are a good amount of people that are concerned about it, too. But I just don\u2019t think, when Bernie Sanders [independent US presidential candidate] came out and said he thinks climate change is the biggest threat that humanity is facing, well, I just think there\u2019s a lot more immediate danger. For me, economic growth is a big threat, that our country has more debt than GDP. But it\u2019s all a matter of perspective.   But do people think it is the responsibility of the developed world to cut down on emissions?  Isaac : When people talk about limiting CO2 [emissions] in the developed world, one thing that kind of goes untalked about is the impact that will have on the developing world. There\u2019s 1.3 billion people in the world that have no access to electricity and I think those people don\u2019t want wind and solar. We [the Western society] were once in the same boat and I think it\u2019s important to note, that when people have a higher standard of living, they demand cleaner environments. In the US, we used to have a lot less environmentally protective ways of going about mining...we didn\u2019t care as much about the environment because people were struggling to survive, but now that we\u2019ve raised our standard of living that becomes a more important consideration. So at some point the people in, for example, India don\u2019t really care and Brazil and other places where people are struggling to survive. They\u2019re fine with deforestation and other things because they need to do that in order to live. But if you can promote their economic well-being \u2013 and a lot of that happens through increasing their ability to access affordable energy in the form of coal, oil or natural gas - they\u2019re going to develop ways of having less impact on the environment while still providing a standard of living to people that is far better than they already have and I think that\u2019s really important.  Hasnaa : I would say yes. This is a point of contention in the ongoing climate negotiations at COP21. Some are saying that agreements made in the early 90s to give the developing world time to catch up with the developed world are now outdated because a lot of the developing world countries are becoming wealthier and are increasingly part of the developed world, but I don\u2019t agree with this line of thought because even countries like India and Brazil still have a lot of catching up to do in some regards. The developed world has been doing things to cause climate change for a long time and the global south will get hit hardest by climate change. I hope climate action will bring the world together. We have everything to gain from making the world a better places and everything to lose by resisting.

(20.04.2012)\n\u00a0 (03.02.2014)\n\u00a0 Climate change skeptics argue that humans are not to blame for climate change, and they often cherrypick scientific facts to support their argument.

In other words, if we're to hit that target, global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) will have to fall by some 45 percent of 2010 levels by 2030, and reach \"net zero\" 20 years after that. There is then a huge amount of work to do. But with Germany still uncertain on when it can phase out coal (and therefore on track to missing its carbon reduction targets), Brazil's new far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro , considering pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, and US President Donald Trump publicly declaring he doesn't believe the climate change predictions presented to him by his own federal agencies, there's something of a question mark over how we're going to achieve such ambitious goals. Read more:\u00a0 How right-wing nationalism fuels climate denial \"Public opinion around the world is that our leaders, governments and businesses should be doing more on this vital issue,\" Hoda Baraka, global communications director with environmental campaign organization 350.org told DW, adding that \"when governments fail, it's up to people to lead.\" Last year was testimony to that notion, with massive people power mobilizing to resist fracking in the UK, march for a transition to renewables in the US, and protest lignite production \u2013 the dirtiest and thus most climate change inducing form of coal \u2013 in Germany. Thousands also came together to pressure German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government to seek a more ambitious target for its coal phaseout. \u00a0 The ambitious road ahead Though still in its infancy, this year has already picked up where the old one left off. \"2019 got off to a pretty intense start,\" Baraka said, citing last week's 67 demonstrations of international support for indigenous land defenders blocking the path for a fracked gas pipeline in Canada. Around the same time, formerly evicted activists in Germany's Hambach Forest, the center of the nation's lignite battle, were re-erecting around 20 tree houses from which to lead their protest. People took to the streets in support of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation opposing a planned pipeline in Canada And events on the calendar for the coming months include international action preparation camps, and climate change related actions around general elections in Nigeria and Indonesia.

We do! \"As we go through 2019 and build towards 2020, we're going to see many more coordinated actions from a multitude of organizations and movements,\" Baraka said. Claudia Kemfert, Head of the department of Energy, Transportation, Environment at the German Institute of Economic Research, told DW she also expects this to be a \"year of change where climate action is coming from civil society and young people more than ever before.\" In the mix will be school children who are planning global and national strikes to protest a lack of climate action. Greta Thunberg started a protest movement that has been picked up by children all over the world The student climate action movement ostensibly began when Swedish 15-year-old Greta Thunberg made lone Friday protest vigils against climate change outside the Swedish parliament. She then delivered a landmark address at the COP24 climate conference in Poland last month. \"We've run out of excuses and we are running out of time,\" she told the adults of the world. \"We have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like it or not.\" Civil society serving as a\u00a0watchdog? So the stage looks set for another year of bold grassroots and civil society climate action, perhaps the boldest yet, but how effective is it? \"Unless you have public pressure, national governments who are often looking at the shorter term, will put aside climate change,\" Antony Froggatt, energy policy consultant and Senior Research Fellow at Chatham House told DW. He says civil society action has been a key actor in the debate in terms of alerting governments to environmental issues, establishing networks and talking to both the media and the public. Going forward, he also sees scope to get involved in monitoring individual states' pledges to reduce emissions. \"It's important that there's a verification of national contributions and there, I think civil society, acting as a watchdog, has an important role to play.\" \u00a0 The economic factor Equally though, Froggatt says, non-state actors working on environment issues can be effective in influencing attitudes, both at an individual consumer level, and in the world of commerce. \"Civil society targets business, which then doesn't only change its own behavior but also supports governments if they have more ambitious plans in terms of climate change.\" Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Brasilia-based Climate Observatory, agrees on the importance of going \"beyond the climate debate\" to connect it with economics. \"It's extremely important to show that mitigation is not only good for the planet,\" Rittl told DW, adding that farmers and agribusiness must also understand that energy and land use efficiency of sustainable agriculture make the industry more economically competitive. But in a country now led by a man already giving over the Amazon \u2013 one of the world's largest carbon sinks that will be vital to fighting climate change \u2013 Rittl says getting that message across \"won't be easy.\" That though, goes for most environmental fights. And certainly for the one to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial averages. But that reality won't stop grassroots and civil society groups from giving it everything they've got. The protesters' symbol was a clock to signal to those meeting at the United Nations climate change conference (COP24) that time is running out if the world is to limit global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Negotiations at the COP have been tough, with disagreements on financing for developing countries and on how states should report their emissions cuts. Some marchers made giant puppets, including of Brazil's president elect, Jair Messias Bolsonaro, to protest the leader's climate policies. Bolsonaro has threatened to follow US President Donald Trump and withdraw his country from the Paris climate agreement. Bolsonaro has also talked about loosening protections for the Amazon rainforest \u2014 the Earth's green lungs. About seven million people worldwide die prematurely due to air pollution every year. Poland's air quality is particularly bad because of the country's dependence on coal for electricity and heating. Some protesters decorated pollution masks to make a statement about Poland's coal policy. During the COP, the country's president said there was no intention to phase out coal. Some groups, like the International Atomic Energy Agency, are promoting nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. It would provide a stable and greenhouse gas-emission-free energy source, says the IAEA. A number of protesters turned up to advocate against nuclear, because there is no good way to deal with the radioactive waste it produces and because it is potentially unsafe, they say. Sustaina Claus arrived at the climate march with his Christmas elves to preach the message of sustainability. The environmental activist says we need to stop overconsumption if we are to stop climate change and protect the planet's resources. Instead of buying mountains of gifts for your loved ones at Christmas, \"you should give the gift of you.\" NGOs said a number of environmental campaigners were refused entry at the Polish border or deported from the country, having been deemed a \"threat\" to national security. Climate Action Network, an umbrella group of climate groups, called the actions worrying. A spokeswoman for Poland's border guards said she could not say whether the refusals were connected to the COP, according to Reuters. Climate activist Lander Wantens cycled over 1,000 kilometers from Belgium to Katowice for the protest and to deliver a message to delegates to do more to combat climate change. He hopes that if the negotiators see \"four guys from Belgium are crazy enough to bike to the climate summit in Poland in winter, maybe that's a signal that they have to work on an ambitious climate agreement.\" Author: Jennifer Collins, Louise Osborne As Germany's coal commission and Chancellor Angela Merkel mull over a strategy for the country's exit from coal, DW's Gero Rueter visits the Rhineland region to meet those whose livelihoods could be on the line.

The study's lead author told DW there's \"little chance of staying within environmental limits\" if no action is taken. A plant-based diet, improved farming practices,\u00a0and reduced food waste are needed to keep the negative environmental effects of the food system within the Earth's limits, according to a new study in the journal Nature . The study found that between 2010 and 2050,\u00a0due to expected changes in population and income levels,\u00a0the environmental effects of the food system could increase by 50\u201390 percent if action is not taken.

In addition to those boundaries, \"ecosystems could be at risk of being destabilized and losing the regulation functions on which populations depend.\" Read more: \u00a0 'Serve less meat and use renewable jet fuel' In terms of food waste, it is currently estimated that more than a third of all food that is produced is lost before it reaches the market, or is wasted by households, according to the study, which was funded by Scandinavian food system think tank EAT. Plant-based diets a must \"The food system has little chance of staying within environmental limits without dietary changes towards more plant-based diets,\" the study's lead author Marco Springmann told DW. That diet would include plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes and nuts, and could\u00a0also include small amounts of animal products, but should have less than one portion of red meat \u2014 beef and pork \u2014 per week. Springmann, a senior researcher at the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food, told DW that animal products have greater environmental impacts, particularly on climate change, because animals need to be fed large amounts of feed that require\u00a0environmental resources in the production process. Read more: \u00a0 Demand for animal feed threatens a tropical paradise He said cows need to be fed 10 kilograms of feed on average to gain 1 kilogram of body weight. For pigs, that ratio is about 6, and for chickens 3-4. Cows also produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, during their digestion process. With everything from meat contamination scandals to concerns about agriculture's climate change impact in the news these days, more and more people are turning to a vegan diet. But, there are other ways to eat in an environmentally-friendly way too. Free-range meat products are now commonplace. Rarely, though, are cows raised in such a paradise as this alpine meadow. In the 1970s and 80s, eating vegetarian, and especially vegan \u2014 abstaining from animal products completely, like milk and eggs \u2014 was not part of the mainstream. Nowadays, things are changing. Jonathan Safran Foer's book \"Eating Animals\" sparked thought about the meat people eat. More vegan restaurants are sprouting up all over the place; here are some dishes from 'P\u00eale-M\u00eale' in Berlin. Eating vegan can reduce carbon footprints and water usage worldwide. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the meat industry generates nearly one-fifth of human-made greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Scientists also say that 13,000 to 15,000 liters of water are needed to produce just one kilogram of beef. With the recent scandal surrounding Dutch horsemeat being sold as beef, more Europeans are now simply choosing to eat meat less. But, for those that can't do without, the \"Meine kleine Farm\" (My little farm) concept tries to achieve transparency with consumers. It aims to give each animal it sells as meat a proper identity. The Potsdam-based farm has a website showing the living conditions of the animals and giving customers a chance to vote online about which animal they want slaughtered next. Since they mainly sell to customers in the nearby region, the 'Meine kleine Farm' project also helps to keep transportation routes \u2014 and thus greenhouse gases \u2014 to a minimum. Eating locally and in season also helps reduce greenhouse gases because it cuts out long transportation routes. Canadians Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon argued for local cuisine in their book, \"100-mile diet: A year of local eating.\" The couple spent one year eating foods from within one hundred miles of their home. Self-preserved foods got them through the winter. The modern industrial agriculture practice of cultivating monocultures, such as corn and soy, can make the crops more susceptible to pests and diseases. This, in turn, promotes the widespread use of pesticides. Small-scale farmers, on the other hand, often promote crop diversity which makes plants naturally more robust, even in periods of drought. Cultivating one's own crops is possible even in big cities, as shown by the \"Princess Garden\" project right in the middle of Germany's capital, Berlin. Crops are grown and consumed locally, with food dishes offered as business lunches at an on-site caf\u00e9. The urban farmers here say gardening raises awareness about the environment and, since the garden is shared, they make friends along the way too. With Germans throwing away an estimated 20 million tons of food a year, food-sharing has become one of the latest environmentally-friendly trends. Restaurants or grocery stores donate still-edible food that they can no longer use to charity organizations. Foodsharing.de is an internet portal where people can swap food they won't be able to eat. Many dietary experts argue that a vegetarian or vegan diet can be good for your health too. Various studies show that a decrease in daily meat consumption may reduce the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Author: Louisa Schaefer Improved farming practices Some farming practices can lead to negative environmental impacts, the study found. This includes excess fertilizer finding its way into river systems and oceans,\u00a0where it can lead to oxygen-depleted dead zones, while other farming practices might make inefficient use of water resources, said Springmann. \"When taken together, we find that improvements in farming practices and technologies can lead to large reductions in the environmental impacts of the food system,\"\u00a0Springmann said. These\u00a0\"are required, together with dietary changes towards more plant-based diets and reductions in food loss and waste, to stay within environmental limits,\" he added. The study comes just after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report outlining what we need to do to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The 2015 Paris Agreement saw the world agree to keep global warming less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and preferably below 1.5 degrees Celsius. But the report found that the difference between those two numbers was significant and could potentially save\u00a0hundreds of millions of people from poverty.

{"id": null, "body": "     Nearly 50 countries are dealing with serious hunger levels as 320 million people lost access to adequate food last year, a newly released index shows. Hunger, violent conflict and the visible impacts of climate change are all contributing to a rise in hunger World hunger was set to end by 2030 \u2014 that was a goal set by United Nations in 2015. After years of progress reducing numbers of undernourished people since 1960, reaching zero hunger by 2030 seemed like an attainable target for the international community. But now, \"the fight against hunger is dangerously off track,\" the latest Global Hunger Index indicates. Over the past two years, economic fallout from the pandemic, climate change and armed conflict have fueled a sharp increase in the\u00a0number of people going hungry around the world, according to the report by nongovernmental organizations Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide . The study, released Thursday, comes not long after the United Nations published data showing that the number of people who did not get adequate nutrition last year increased 320 million to 2.4 billion \u2014 amounting to nearly a third of the world's population. This increase is equivalent to that of the previous five years combined. \"We can clearly see that progress is slowing or even reversing,\" said Miriam Wiemers, one of the authors of the index. Beyond undernourishment and availability of calories, the index monitors other factors such as diet quality, stunted growth among children and child mortality. \"These factors reflect the long-term effects of hunger on the population health, and on children's physical, mental and cognitive development,\" Wiemers added. The index reveals how about 50 countries around the world are in an alarming or serious situation, meaning that hunger affects a significant part of their population. A 2021 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, a UN agency)\u00a0connects global warming \u2014 in particular, more frequent and intense weather events such as storms, floods and droughts \u2014 to increased food insecurity. \"One of the reasons that [sub-Saharan] Africa has higher levels of hunger is because of lack of preparedness for climate change challenges,\" said Joe Mzinga, a spokesperson of ESAFF, a network small-scale farmers in eastern and southern Africa. Reliance on a single type of crop makes the population particularly vulnerable to climate change, Mzinga explained.\u00a0 \"One of the biggest challenges that we're facing is the loss of biodiversity and the push for quite specific types of crops, which in the case of South and East Africa, is maize. \"Maize needs plenty of water [to grow], so a shortage of rainfall quickly leads to a food crisis.\" With these trends, there is also an unaddressed element of climate justice. \"We have countries with less share of carbon emission that carry the burden of climate change,\" Wiemers pointed out. Supply chain breakdowns and restrictions attempting to stem the spread of COVID-19 simultaneously caused consumer prices to increase and producer prices to fall, decreasing food security for the urban and rural poor, the FAO reports. Add to that how pandemic curfews in many African and Asian countries inadvertently led to food losses, as drivers who normally transported fresh produce during the cooler nighttime hours were no longer able to do so. For the world's hungry and undernourished people, climate change is a threat multiplier The pandemic also revealed how higher-income countries are similarly vulnerable to food price increases and shortages . According to government reports in the United States, prices of meat, poultry, fish and eggs rose 5.9% over last year, and were up 15.7% compared to August 2019. Due to the enduring impacts of the pandemic on the world's economy, the number of people who are estimated to be undernourished by 2030\u00a0will rise by 30 million, the FAO report showed.\u00a0 Separately, other studies indicate 2.6 million children could suffer from stunted growth between 2020 and 2022 \u00a0in low- and middle-income countries,\u00a0compared with pre-pandemic expectations.\u00a0 Violent conflict can cripple every aspect of a food system.\u00a0In conflict regions, crops are destroyed, livestock is stolen and people are driven off their land.\u00a0 During a war, \"we cannot continue with production as usual, and we can't access markets as usual,\" Mzinga said.\u00a0 Conflict is a major driver of hunger in eight out of 10 countries with alarming or extremely alarming levels of hunger, the index report says. Violent conflicts are increasing in number, as well as becoming more severe,\u00a0it added. As conflict contributes to hunger, heightened food insecurity can contribute to violent conflict in a vicious cycle. As competition over scarce resources mounts, ethnic and religious divisions are more likely to spur conflict, a 2017 study by the World Food Program shows. \"Without resolving food insecurity, it is difficult to build sustainable peace, and without peace the likelihood of ending global hunger is minimal,\" the index report stated. Fighting hunger is not only about reaching our policy's target; it's about people's right to access adequate and nutritious food, Wiemers said. \"It's a basic human right. So right now, we have millions of people around the world whose human rights are violated on a daily basis,\" she concluded. Resilient food systems contribute to peacebuilding by strengthening livelihood security  United Nations experts say some 350,000 people in Ethiopia's Tigray province are acutely threatened by starvation, with millions more at risk. Agencies and aid groups say conflict is to blame.\n\u00a0 Efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus have left many Cambodians without access to food, essential medicines and other necessities for weeks.\n\u00a0 Filipino fishing communities find ways to protect their livelihoods against COVID-19 and climate change. \n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Pandemic, climate change and conflict fuel sharp rise in global hunger", "article_name": "pandemic-climate-change-and-conflict-fuel-sharp-rise-in-global-hunger", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/pandemic-climate-change-and-conflict-fuel-sharp-rise-in-global-hunger/a-59488549", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 5980, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:42.314422"}
{"id": null, "body": "     The pandemic has torn a deep hole into Germany's budget, which is being plugged with more and more new loans. The new government's mountain of debt has grown to over \u20ac1.4 trillion. More money will be needed in 2022. One of the first official acts by new German\u00a0Finance Minister Christian Lindner was something of a turnaround. Five days after being sworn into the post, Lindner \u2014 the chairman of the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) \u2014 introduced a supplementary budget bill in\u00a0parliament\u00a0that only months before, when\u00a0still in opposition, he would have castigated as completely unsound. Now, he proposed to transfer what is left over in pandemic loans in 2021 to go toward investment into climate protection. A total of \u20ac240 billion ($270 billion) in credit had been approved for hardship loans, and\u00a0about \u20ac60 billion are left over, which\u00a0Lindner wants to move\u00a0to the Energy and Climate Fund. This money is to help with \"the transformation of one of the largest industrialized nations toward climate neutrality,\"\u00a0finance minister said in the Bundestag, referring once again to the declared goal of the new coalition government of center-left Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and FDP. The plan has not go down well with everyone. It is \"fundamentally problematic to create financial reserves by taking out debt and then use these funds to finance projects in the coming years,\" according to the German Taxpayers Federation. The conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), who are now in opposition, are outraged. \"I consider this supplementary budget to be unconstitutional,\" said Christian Haase, the budget policy spokesman for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag. The reallocation of funds, he said, was nothing more than a circumvention of the debt rules enshrined in the Basic Law, Germany's constitution. \"I consider this supplementary budget to be the beginning of the end of the constitutional debt brake.\" The finance minister finds himself in an awkward situation: For years, he has been pushing for Germany to reinstate the debt brake enshrined in the constitution. It stipulates that the state may only spend as much money as it takes in \u2014 except for a small credit line to cover emergency spending. Because of the coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, which qualifies as a major emergency, the debt brake has been suspended. Now, the new finance minister assures us, it will be respected again no later than 2023. But is that realistic? Lindner\u00a0is facing the constraints posed by a governing coalition that\u00a0will need an enormous amount of money in the coming years to deal with the consequences of the pandemic \u2014 and must urgently allocate funds to deal with the climate crisis , as well. Lindner has to find money that he doesn't have. Germany's\u00a0federal budget is generally inflexible. Every second euro is earmarked for social benefits,\u00a0the lion's share of which are pension payments. Cuts are not possible, as the aging society is actually increasing the overall demand. The fallout of the COVID pandemic is also driving up social spending. In the coalition negotiations, the FDP ensured that there would be no tax hikes. But this leaves new borrowing as the only option. Since the start of the pandemic, Germany has taken on considerably more debt. From 2014 to 2019 all federal budgets were balanced, but then in 2020 and 2021 there were record levels of borrowing. The government's mountain of debt grew by around \u20ac400 billion\u00a0in the two years to a total of well over \u20ac1.4 trillion. If the debts of Germany's 16 states and its smaller\u00a0local authorities are combined, the total comes to\u00a0just under \u20ac2.4 trillion. It was originally agreed that pandemic-related debts are to be repaid within the next 20 years. But in the coalition negotiations agreed to by the three parties\u00a0extend debt repayment by another 16 to 36 years. In 2022, the federal government will continue borrowing. Under the previous government under Chancellor Angela Merkel, in which\u00a0 new Chancellor Olaf Scholz was finance minister, almost \u20ac100 billion\u00a0in new debts were earmarked for 2022. However, this was only within the framework of a draft budget that never became law. This is standard practice in years when there is a general election; it is then up to the new government either to revise the old draft or to draw up a completely new one. The question is: How much debt will be taken on for 2022? In recent weeks, economic forecasts have been lowered further and further in the face of the fourth wave of the pandemic. Now the fifth wave, triggered by the Omicron variant of the virus, is rolling in and will predictably put a further dampener on the German economy: It will reduce tax revenues and again increase the need for government financial aid. The hardship assistance for ailing companies was supposed to expire at the end of 2021. Now it has been extended by half a year. According to the Federal Ministry of Finance, almost \u20ac58 billion have been paid out to companies in the form of non-repayable grants (as of November 2021). The repayable aid, which includes loans, guarantees and state equity investments, amounts to just under \u20ac70 billion. In 2022, companies will have to start repaying. But how is that supposed to work when the pandemic will affect business well into next year? It is to be expected that many repayments will not be made, plus new applications will be filed also for furlough\u00a0and reduced-hours contract \u00a0unemployment benefits. Catering, entertainment and tourism sectors have already announced layoffs. Pandemic management is just one area of urgency. The transformation of the economy toward climate neutrality needs to start as soon as possible. \"Due to the uncertainties and restrictions in the COVID crisis, many investments in modernizing the economy have been canceled,\" Lindner said. He wants to use the \u20ac60 billion in the new supplementary budget to boost the national economy. \"It is essential to start catching up now. We must lose no more time in the transformation of the economy and society because of the pandemic.\" Lindner expects this to generate more economic growth and thus more tax revenue. It will also be interesting to see how the new\u00a0finance minister positions himself in EU fiscal policy. Before this year's federal election, Lindner was seen as a fearmonger, especially in southern EU countries, because he wanted to advocate a tough consolidation course. Now his national supplementary budget of \u20ac60 billion has triggered quite different expectations. This became apparent during Lindner's inaugural visit to Paris, when his French counterpart, Bruno le Maire, expressly congratulated him on his move. It was also noted with approval in France and some southern European EU countries that the new chancellor,\u00a0Scholz, and his Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck (Greens) are both warning against austerity within the EU. Until now, the European Stability Pact has only allowed member countries' debt levels of 60% of their gross domestic product (the sum of all economic output). Many countries failed to adhere to this restriction \u2014 in some cases significantly so. In 2019, Germany was below 60% for the first time since 2002. In 2020, it reached over 68% again. And the trend is going up. This article has been translated from German. While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The trick is this: After a while, the relentlessness batters through how foolish you feel, and you have no choice but to reach for your deepest feelings of loss. That's the idea anyway. This was one of the things that happened when I joined the grief workshop at the Climate Psychology Alliance (CPA) conference in London earlier this year. This association of psychotherapists formed 10 years ago in response to the split lives their clients live: going about their regular late-capitalist existence while struggling with hard emotions \u2014 helplessness, guilt, panic, anxiety, grief, despair \u2014 because the planet's ecology was being pushed towards collapse and no one was doing anything about it.

Not that the media is helping, because, as psychoanalyst and CPA member Rosemary Randall explained in\u00a0 \u00a02009 , the news about climate change gives us just two stories: \"monstrous and terrifying images of the future accompanied by bland and ineffective proposals for change now.\" As climate change-related floods, droughts and wildfires intensify, so too does anxiety over the future of the planet Denial \u2014 or disavowal, in the jargon of psychoanalysis \u2014 describes a state where \"you both know and don't know that something is true,\" Randall said during the conference. She added that this is a good definition of what surveys about climate change have shown.\u00a0People know it is real but don't want to feel that it affects them. In other words, people have grown used to worrying and feeling guilty while they book plane tickets. And without confronting our sense of loss, we end up living anxious double lives.

One such survey , produced by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication in January, found that while seven out of 10 Americans believe that climate change is happening, and about the same number are at least \"somewhat worried\" about it, only half believe they will be affected by it. The same survey found that\u00a0four in 10 Americans said that either they or their families are making at least a moderate effort to change their behavior because of global warming. Read more: \u00a0 Psychology behind climate inaction: How to beat the 'doom barrier' A different order of grief Psychoanalysis might be able to name the problem, and offer the tools to deal with grief, but as one man at the CPA conference got up to say: \"It seems to me we're dealing with a different order of grief. We're not talking about the loss of a loved one, we're talking about the loss of everything.\"\u00a0 In other words, what if it's rational to panic and despair? What if you know that your therapist should be feeling the same things you are, but they keep asking about your mum? What if it's not just in your head? How can people deal with grief and still take action on climate change when that grief is about the loss of everything? Laura Schmidt and Aimee Lewis-Reau have been thinking about this. The founders of the Good Grief Network have settled in a small blue house in Arizona surrounded by huge cactuses, rocks, and lizards just to reflect on it. As both activists and survivors of difficult childhoods and breakdowns, they became frustrated with the way therapists told them they were projecting personal problems onto the planet. \"Several of my therapists have been like,\u00a0'Oh, you were abused as a child? You're just projecting that onto the Earth.'\" says Schmidt. \"And my response is,\u00a0'Yes, and? And?' These are very real things and if you read any scientific report you know this is not just projection.\" Read more:\u00a0 Climate change takes a toll on our minds, too In fact, traditional therapy might well be part of the problem. Psychotherapists are beginning to see a connection between our individualism, the consumerist promise of self-fulfillment, and our environmental predicament: What if our therapists, in teaching us to love ourselves, have helped us create this selfish culture and the monstrous fossil-fuel economy it depends on? \"Mainstream psychology needs to be revamped,\" says Schmidt. \"It needs to take into account our social connections, our community, how we position ourselves as human beings, and not as individuals.\" You could say that psychotherapy needs to get political. The Good Grief Network tackles climate anxiety with group therapy Ten steps to 'resilience in a chaotic climate' They aren't the only ones who think this, but Schmidt and Lewis-Reau have created one of the more practical responses with their Good Grief Network \u2014\u00a0a leaderless organization of activists and generally worried people that meets online to work through their \"10 Steps.\" Read more: \u00a0 In the eye of the firestorm: Surviving Australia's most extreme bushfire Adapted from the famous 12 of Alcoholics Anonymous, Good Grief's steps are built around acknowledging the enormity of the problem and one's own place in it, \"sitting with\" the uncertainty it creates, and as Schmidt puts it, reaching past the \"reptilian brain\" responses of \"panic and denial.\" \"It doesn't suit us to stifle that panic;\u00a0it doesn't suit us to pretend it doesn't exist,\" she says. \"Instead we honor that panic and see what's behind it. And what's behind that panic is fear of loss.\" It seems to help. As one Good Grief member told me: \"This is what was missing!\" Aimee Lewis-Reau (left) and LaUra Schmidt (right) founded the Good Grief Network to help those anxious about climate change Lewis-Reau is delighted when I ask what effect the meetings have. \"I love this question! We see a shift in energy, in body language, and enthusiasm for life,\" she says. \"They come in defeated and anxious, shoulders high, they leave more present, more grounded, with clarity.\" Read more:\u00a0 Change your ways, save the environment The turning point, she's noticed, is step 4: \"Honor My Own Mortality & The Mortality Of All.\" It turns out that people tend to open up when they confront death and disaster. \"The first four steps are always very hard,\" she says. \"I can sense the anxiety and the self-consciousness. But a shift happens right around the death anxiety step, and people start to be themselves and crack jokes. They start to feel a real safety and community.\" Good Grief, they say, helps activists keep fighting \u2014 or just cope emotionally with the gulf between their small victories and the profound change we need to save the planet. Honor the panic, because the problem is not just in your head. So what did I tell that stranger in the conference room? What is dying in me? Maybe the need to cling on to this civilization.\u00a0 Although there is a combination of factors behind the numerous jellyfish that reach vacation havens like the Mediterranean coast, climate change is also partially to blame. Warmer sea temperatures are opening up new areas where jellyfish can reproduce, and increasing the availability of their favorite food: plankton. Prized for their superior sound quality, an original Stradivarius can sell for millions of dollars. Yet, extreme weather events, such as unusually violent storms, are killing millions of trees, putting at risk the famous wood in the Paneveggio forest, in northern Italy. Replanting trees won't help much in the short term. A spruce has to be at least 150 years old before it can become a violin. On very hot nights, people sleep worse, especially in big cities. By 2050 European metropolises may experience temperatures around 3.5 degrees Celsius warmer in summer. It not only affects sleep, but also mood, productivity and mental health. The only way to escape is to move to smaller towns and settlements, where the nights are cooler since there are fewer buildings and more greenery. Spring is starting earlier in the year due to global warmer temperatures \u2014 bad news for allergy sufferers. With a longer frost-free season, plants have more time to grow, bloom and produce pollen. Therefore, pollen will freely roam around much earlier, which will make the suffering season longer and the annual pollen load greater. Will it be the century of masks for air pollution and allergies? Heat not only makes us sweat; it also affects our health. By the end of this century three-quarters of the world's population is expected to be exposed to dangerous and deadly heat waves. Rising temperatures mean an increase in diarrheal diseases, as it's easier for bacteria to multiply in warm food and water. Mosquito numbers will also likely go up, along with the spread of diseases like malaria. Soil in the region around the North Pole is increasingly thawing in the summer months, with dramatic local and global consequences. Warmer temperatures cause floors to become unstable and houses and roads to crack, and leads to many more insects. Moreover, if permafrost \u2014 frozen soil \u2014 melts, it will release CO2 and methane gases that could further exacerbate global warming. It's a vicious circle. Temperature can influence the sex of several species. For sea turtles, the heat of the sand where the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the newborn. Low temperatures benefit male turtles, while females develop better in warmer areas. Researchers have found that over 99% of turtle hatchlings in northern Australia are already female, making it difficult for the species to survive.

{"id": null, "body": "     Few delegates at the Munich Security Conference showed up to discuss climate change. But those that did were reminded that the current collapse of the Earth's ecosystems is already causing conflict and mass migration. School children might be taking to the streets to protest government inaction across Europe, and scientists might be predicting extreme weather and catastrophic food shortages across the world, but for the delegates of the Munich Security Conference , climate change does not seem to be a very urgent problem. The main conference hall, packed out to celebrate Angela Merkel's plea for multilateralism, its occupants looking\u00a0a\u00a0little nonplussed when US Vice President Mike Pence declared Donald Trump a \"champion of freedom,\" was half empty\u00a0when a panel including representatives of Bangladesh, Kenya\u00a0and Norway discussed the obvious links between climate disruption and global security risks. As the panelists noted, even though this represented the first time that climate change had been included in the MSC's main program, the security community had actually been the first to identify climate change as \"a threat multiplier.\" In other words, climate change is increasing the likelihood of mass migration, terrorism, infectious diseases, and therefore global instability. US only major power on panel Indeed, the only major power represented on the panel was the United States, whose delegation sent Sheldon Whitehouse of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works to talk about hope for a \"climate tax\" and the power of fossil fuel companies in the US. Read more:\u00a0 German President Steinmeier: 'We only have this one planet' As it happened, it fell to former Secretary of State John Kerry to get up from the first row and point out the gravity of the circumstances. \"We are currently living out, by acts of omission and commission, a mutual suicide pact on this planet,\" the political veteran said in a genuinely angry intervention. \"We know how to do things, but we're not doing them! We are on the road to a four-degree rise this century. Are we talking about that?\" Kerry was impatient with the idea that the political importance of security could become an opportunity to push climate change higher up the agenda. \"It's not that it's an opportunity, it's that it's stark reality,\" he told DW afterwards. \"The fact is we've been talking about it as a security issue for a number of years.\" Former US Secretary of State John Kerry was visibly upset with the international community's inertia on climate issues \"We had meetings with military people all round our country, talking about the threat multiplier effect,\" he continued. \"Major generals in our country have spoken about climate change as a fundamental security issue, and we had an office in the Pentagon, until Trump, that was focused on planning to deal with climate change. Trump shut the office. People need to connect the dots.\" On the panel, Monica Juma, Kenyan Cabinet secretary for foreign affairs, explained how ethnic land disputes were flaring as Lake Turkana, in the north of her country, dries up. Making things worse, droughts in the Turkana basin are also threatening the livelihoods of half a million people. \"So it is not a surprise that we're beginning to see analyses saying that perhaps one of the major conflicts we are going to see is water wars,\" she said. Read more:\u00a0 Hard-hit by climate change, Bangladesh finds solution in floating gardens \u00a0 Meanwhile another panelist, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Hasina Wajed, whose country has already experienced catastrophic flooding, described how her government had been forced to take its own measures, for lack of international support. John Kerry described what was happening to Bangladesh as \"immoral.\" Failures of market capitalism The social effects of climate change are already noticeable enough to be affecting how people react to politicians. \"We're experiencing the leading edge, right now, of massive dislocations in the Earth's natural systems,\" said Sheldon Whitehouse. \"That results in the dislocation of the human species. That causes suffering, and when people suffer, they want explanations, they want accountability and justice.\" \"And when people look back at this time, they will say, 'Free market capitalism, and free elected democracies, conspicuously failed to prevent the harm that is now hurting me and my family,'\" he added. It's not as if ordinary people aren't already feeling this anxiety. A new study released by the Pew Research Center found that climate change was the biggest fear in almost all of the 26 countries surveyed: including Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Argentina, South Korea\u00a0and most of Europe's biggest countries. The Pew survey also underscored how ideological the reaction to climate change is, with supporters of right-wing populist parties in Europe and the Republican party in the US much more skeptical.

Read more: \u00a0 Munich Security Report sees world as a broken puzzle Even though those conflicts seem far away from affluent cities like Munich, their impact on the systems that hold the prosperous parts of the world together is already being felt. In fact, some studies have shown that droughts in North Africa exacerbated the migration crisis that reached\u00a0the Bavarian capital, and Germany more broadly, in autumn 2015. \"The climate crisis will be the dominant cause for migration movements in the future,\" Green party parliamentary leader Anton Hofreiter told DW. \"When weaker countries experience several drought disasters or floods, it might not be the only cause for the collapse of a country, but such countries are more likely to fall into civil war and chaos.\" Panelist Bunny McDiarmid, co-executive director of Greenpeace, reminded the audience about what was going on outside, and across Europe. \"We've got school kids marching in the streets because they don't believe politicians are acting fast enough,\" she said. \"They're the only adults in the room.

He is following a similar path to fellow moguls like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Monday committed $10 billion of his fortune to set up a fund aimed at tackling the climate crisis, weeks after hundreds of his employees signed a blog demanding the online retail giant take drastic steps to reduce its carbon footprint. The fund, named Bezos Earth Fund, will begin issuing grants to scientists and activists this summer, the world's richest man announced in an Instagram post. \"Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet.

{"id": null, "body": "     The river Ganges holds deep religious and ritualistic significance for India's million of Hindus. But climate change is endangering the holy river, reports Jasvinder Sehgal. The sun is setting in Rishikesh, an Indian city in the Himalayan foothills. Hundreds of people have converged on the banks of the Ganges to sing hymns in praise of the goddess of the sacred river.  One group sits around a pyre to perform the yajna \u2014 a religious ritual carried out every evening for centuries to thank the river for flowing. The air is heavy with the aroma of cow dung cake, butter and sandalwood incense.  But worshippers are worried that the mighty Ganges, so central to the religion, culture and economy for millions of Indians, may in the future be reduced to a trickle.  \"I have never seen such scanty water in the River Ganges,\" Gauri Pandey, a cobbler who has been coming here to worship for 45 years, told DW. \"I saw people walking in the river to another bank. The water level was below waist height. Some say if this trend continues, there are chances that Ganges may dry in the next 30 years.\"   It is here, among the mountains, that the Ganges rises Disappearing glaciers  Predictions and information about water levels vary, but the WWF has listed the 2,520-kilometer (1,568-mile) Ganges as among the world's most endangered rivers. Scientists and environmentalists have pointed the finger at rising temperatures and receding glaciers.  The holy water originates at the Gangotri glacier, which is more than 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) above sea level on the Indian side of the snowy Himalayas, and provides 70 percent of the river's water.  But it is now shrinking at a rate of 22 meters per year \u2014 nearly twice as fast as 20 years ago.  \"The glacier has shrunk by almost 40 kilometers in 50,000 years,\" said Milap Chand Sharma, the country's leading glaciologist and a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.  But he added that scientists believe human-caused climate change has resulted in a faster retreat. Winter snowfalls, which maintain the glacier, have been declining, affecting the amount of water flowing into the river annually.  Mahesh Sharma, a journalist attending the evening prayers on the river, has visited the glaciers more than 50 times in the last three decades and has seen the impact.\u00a0  \"The snow range has lessened,\" he said, adding that even at 5,000 meters, at the source of the Ganges, \"you don't feel like wearing very warm clothes.\"  Efforts have been increased to clean the Ganges, one of the most polluted rivers in the world Impact on people   The Ganges is not only central to Indian spiritual life \u2014 it also provides more than half a billion people with water for drinking and farming.  Eight states in India are already facing drought. And according to the International Water Resource Management Institute, industry and population growth will imply a 32 percent increase in national water demand by 2050.  Kamal Barua sells fish in a local market in Haridwar. He used to live in a village adjacent to Farakka town in west Bengal \u2014 but last year, he and his family had to move when the waters in which he fished were no longer deep enough to yield an adequate catch. They are not the only ones.  \"My village was located at one of the largest rivers of the world \u2014 I never thought of facing scarcity of water in my entire life,\" he said.   The Ganges is of great spiritual importance to millions of Hindus Pollution, not climate change, a priority  But sinking water levels is not the only problem facing the river. By the time the crystal-clear waters have snaked their way down the mountains, past sprawling countryside and through burgeoning cities to meet the sea at the Bay of Bengal, they have become a filthy soup.  Sewage, along with agricultural and industrial waste, have earned the Ganges second-place behind Indonesia's Citarum on the list of the world's most-polluted rivers. And that is taking its toll on human health.  Gastrointestinal and enteric diseases are widespread. In 2012, the World Health Organization said more than 115,000 people in India died from water and sanitation related issues.  And a National Cancer Registry Program study reported a higher incidence of cancer among those living along its banks.\u00a0India's government has invested more \u20ac2.5 billion euros in cleaning up the polluted waters \u2014 an operation that has thus far taken precedence over water availability, U.P. Singh, director general of the National Mission for Clean Ganga ,\u00a0told DW. But, he added, cleanup \"is one of our important long-term goals.\"  To achieve it, policy-makers have proposed three programs that would interlink rivers across different parts of the country, increasing water supply to those that are drying up.   The Ganges is of great spiritual importance to millions of Hindus Connecting people with water  But Rajender Singh, a winner of the Stockholm Water Prize \u2014 also known as the Nobel prize for water \u2014 considers the plans flawed.  \"Interlinking rivers will not make India drought- and flood-free,\" he said. \"It will create tension and conflicts in the country.\"  Singh, who has so far revived eight rivers and helped return water to more than 1,000 villages in the western Indian state of Rajasthan, says efforts to restore the Ganges are too focused on large-scale engineering approaches.  He promotes getting local communities involved in planting trees on riverbanks to deal with the problems of silting and erosion, and restoring tributaries that feed the Ganges.\u00a0  \"If we wish to free our country from drought and floods, we have to link people with rivers.\"  Given that Hindus already have such a profound relationship with their holy Ganges, that is a foundation that can be built upon.  And as Swami Chidanand Saraswati, founder of Ganga Action , stressed at the conclusion of evening prayers in Rishikesh, failure to act could have untold consequences.  \"If Ganga dies, India dies,\" he said.  \"Losing glaciers means losing life \u2014 water is life, water is a blessing. That's why it is our prime duty to save the glaciers.\" This award-winning podcast is for those who want more than just the green angle when it comes to the environment and climate change. \n\u00a0 Rukam's residents thought selling their land to a palm oil company would bring wealth, but the environment has suffered.\n\u00a0 At the G7 summit, rich countries should finally take responsibility, quit coal by 2030 and honor their promises to compensate poorer countries least responsible for the climate crisis, says Mathias Mogge.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Excessive and erratic rainfall has caused devastating flooding, hitting parts of Bangladesh hard.

{"id": null, "body": "     The world is \"sleepwalking to climate catastrophe,\" the head of the UN has warned as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change examines ways to keep greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Leading climate scientists warn the global economy must move from fossil fuels UN chief Antonio Guterres criticized major economies on Monday for allowing carbon pollution to increase when drastic cuts are needed. He said the world was \"sleepwalking to climate catastrophe .\" Guterres' comments to a sustainability summit in London came as nearly 200 nations gathered to discuss plans to reduce carbon emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is finalizing a 3,000-page report for policymakers that will be published in two weeks. Scientists and government officials are examining plans to reduce and even remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in an urgent effort to stop global warming. \"We are not on track to limit the temperature increase to a 1.5-degrees-Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) limit,\" warned UN Deputy Secretary-General Ligia Noronha. \"We know that we are on the verge of a catastrophe,\" she added. Representatives of the nearly 200 countries were meeting virtually to finalize the third and final report that the IPCC issued over the past eight months. They were finishing a summary of the 3,000-page report for policymakers to be published on April 4. The previous two have looked at the causes and impacts of the climate crisis . In the third report, scientists focused on ways in which critical sectors such as energy, transport, industry and agriculture can cut emissions . \"We are talking about the large-scale transformation of all the major systems,\" climate economist and co-author Celine Guivarch told the AFP news agency. The global economy must move from fossil fuels to low- or zero-carbon energy sources, including solar,\u00a0wind, nuclear, hydro and hydrogen, according to the report. The mitigation report would also look more closely at ways of removing CO2 that is already in the atmosphere. \"The next few years will be crucial for the state of climate change in this century. This is why an updated assessment of mitigation is more important than ever,\" said Hoesung Lee, chairperson of the IPCC. The mitigation report is the third and final part of the Sixth Assessment Report, an updated, comprehensive review of global knowledge of the climate crisis. Much of the focus would be on short-term actions governments can take to keep the rise in global temperatures\u00a0 under 1.5 C this century. A\u00a01.5 C cap\u00a0on global warming, the aspirational goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord, has been embraced as a target by most of the world's nations.

Make it cooler with efficient lightbulbs. This is one of the small actions that make a difference in the long-term - and let's be honest, it's not a big effort. Some LED bulbs consume up to 90 percent less than traditional ones. In cold or rainy countries, the task might be challenging - but these challenges are nothing compared to the worst consequences of climate change. Recycling has become normal behavior for thousands of people around the world. It definitely contributes to making a better world - but unfortunately, it is not enough. Worried about your clothes shrinking in hot water? Here another reason to keep washing with cold water: Since it avoids turning on the water heater, cold-water washing also produces less greenhouse gas emissions. Until you are ready to get rid of your car completely, you could move to a hybrid electric car. But beware: The electricity that powers it is probably still coming from dirty fossil fuels. Beef production is the largest driver of tropical deforestation worldwide, with soy production closely following - mainly to feed animals. The carbon footprint of a meat-based diet is almost double that of a vegetarian one. Even reducing the amount of meat you eat makes a difference. Renewable energies are the new trend - but we are still largely dependent on fossil fuels such as coal. In countries like Germany, you can choose your energy provider - among some that draw from renewable sources. Air travel is a major challenge when it comes to tackling climate change. Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study. But if you start now with the other nine actions, your kids might be able to live in a better world.

{"id": null, "body": "     With the UN climate conference poised to start in Glasgow next week, DW looks at what has \u2014 and has not \u2014 been achieved over the past quarter century of such global gatherings. It's nearly time that the\u00a0 Conference of the Parties (COP),\u00a0the supreme decision-making body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),\u00a0takes place, this time in Glasgow from October 31 until November 12. At the COP's\u00a0very first meeting, in Berlin in 1995, the members already saw the need to reduce emissions and agreed to meet annually to discuss how to maintain control over global warming. But what concrete actions have 25 years of these meetings resulted in so far? According to most climate change activists, not that many. Greta Thunberg recently told the Guardian : \"Nothing has changed from previous years really. \u2026 We can have as many COPs as we want, but nothing real will come out of it.\" So do we really still need COP? Though experts agree that important progress was not made at all of these annual meetings \u2014 and the pace of decision-making has been slower than expected \u2014 they say COP's most vital achievement so far has been the Paris Agreement of COP21 , the biggest global \u00a0 treaty against climate change \u00a0 yet. It was a historic moment when the Paris Accord was signed by almost all nations in the world after decades of negotiation It may have taken 20 years of negotiations to get there, but, in 2015, the Paris Accord was finally adopted by 196 countries , declaring the goal of limiting an increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F),\u00a0with a target of\u00a01.5 C, over preindustrial levels. And this has provoked a major change in terms of climate action and where we are heading, David Ryfisch, team leader for international climate politics at the nongovernmental environment and development organization Germanwatch, told DW. \"I believe that the Paris Accord is the starting point for a whole series of change,\" Ryfisch said. \"It's a signal that has been sent to the real economy, to other actors, that the intent by countries is real and that it will have real-world implications.\"\u00a0 COP and its Paris Accord have already translated into action, Ryfisch said, from the dramatic drop in the cost of clean energy , to the financial sector's moving away from fossil fuels and unwillingness to insure new coal projects any longer, to countries' signing up for a\u00a0 quick phaseout of coal , as well as internal combustion engines . Still, it's hard to really grasp tangible impacts the accord has had. The challenge for COP and the Paris Accord is that it revolves around CO2, a greenhouse gas that has caused most of the observed warming we've had. The word has to dramatically reduce its CO2 emissions in order to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius \"CO2 is our main issue if we want to address the climate problem,\"\u00a0Paul Young, climate scientist at Lancaster University, told DW. \"CO2 just pervades everything, the whole economy,\" Young said. \"And it is quite hard to turn that oil tanker around. Carbon dioxide is not something we can just swap out with another chemical.\" Charles Parker, a political scientist at the University of Uppsala in Sweden who has focused his research on climate change politics, leadership and crisis management, offered a similar analysis. \"We ultimately need to find substitutes for fossil fuels and find low-carbon and no-carbon energy sources. But there are many vested interests, veto players and lobby groups who have no interest in doing that,\" he said. That's why the target negotiations at COP are so vital. Every country that signed the Paris Agreement\u00a0had to make pledges, also known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, for how they plan on reducing their emissions. Over time, they have to make these targets more ambitious, which is called the ratcheting mechanism. So, every five years, they have to submit new, updated NDCs on how they want to keep the promises made in 2015. \"What we've seen between 2015 and 2020 is that these targets have significantly improved already, not sufficient to be in line with 1.5 degrees, but they have significantly improved. That is the first clear signal that something is working,\" Ryfisch said. The problem many critics see is that there aren't any financial or legal sanctions if countries don't reach their targets. The sanctioning comes rather through public pressure, Ryfisch said, as countries have a reputation to lose. \"So then it actually comes down to the role of civil society, youth movements and academia to question their respective countries. Obviously, that works better in some countries than others. But there is a symbiosis between what came out of Paris and the actions that we saw on the ground by civil society over the past years,\" he said. Another sign that points to this symbiosis are two recent court cases in Europe. Germany's Federal Constitutional Court ruled that\u00a0 the freedoms and fundamental rights of young people have been violated by insufficient climate protection from the state. A coalition of environmental groups is calling for a Europe-wide ban on fossil fuel advertising ahead of COP26 And in the Netherlands, a court ordered gas company Shell to reduce its worldwide CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. \"Now that we've seen these success cases, I believe that more companies and potentially countries will be brought in front of courts,\" Ryfisch said. He believes this will result in a chain reaction and trigger companies and countries to take action instead of also being dragged before court. \"All of that would not have been possible without COP,\" he said. So, despite its shortcomings, experts believe having a global governance meeting such as COP is crucial for the future of the climate. \"I absolutely believe we need COP. We are now in the decisive decade where we can still stay within the 1.5-degree limit. Glasgow has to show that 1.5-degree is the limit,\" Ryfisch said.\u00a0 But that won't be easy to reach. According to the UN , the world is on a catastrophic way to 2.7 degrees of heating by the end of the century unless wealthy nations commit to tackling emissions now. Locusts, boosted by drought, heavy rains and warm temperatures, have devastated crops in East Africa. Pesticides can help, though they're not exactly environmentally friendly. Scientists in Nairobi have experimented with fungi and other microbes to make safer poisons. They've also used the locusts' unique smell, which changes as they mature, to break up swarms and even drive them to cannibalism. Wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity worldwide, and Africa is no exception. In Botswana, firefighters are learning the age-old techniques of Australia's northern Indigenous people. They prevent bigger fires by preemptively burning away grass and dry leaves, preserving biodiversity and reducing CO2 emissions. Angola, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique could also benefit. People in Zimbabwe are also looking to the past to plan for the future. Faced with flooding linked to climate change, some are reviving ngazi, traditional thatched homes on stilts. These elevated structures, about 2 meters (6.5 feet) above the ground, are making a comeback along the Zambezi River. They protect inhabitants from floods while keeping them cooler than brick homes. Namibia is one of southern Africa's most arid countries, and it's expecting longer, more intense droughts in the future. Windhoek, with more than 400,000 people, has already anticipated that problem. Back in 1968, the city installed the word's first water recycling plant, reclaiming sewage for drinking water in a 10-step process. Expanded in 2002, it continues to deliver a reliable water supply. Maps are crucial for helping communities prepare for increased risks of flooding, landslides and storms linked to climate change. And, yet, many African maps are rarely updated \u2014 even in urban areas, where rapid unplanned growth can stay hidden for years. Drones can help planners get an updated view, while machine learning uses satellite data to develop risk maps for cities and agricultural areas. Hydroponics, raising plants without soil, has allowed some farmers to grow crops with very little water or space. It's a great option for Africa's arid regions, but such setups require a constant supply of electricity \u2014 not ideal in places with frequent power outages. Two mechanical engineering students in South Africa have designed a new pipe system that only requires power for four hours a day. Farms in low-lying areas such as Egypt's Nile Delta are threatened by rising seas and salty water. Some people have begun to look to China (above) for ideas on how to raise fish and grow plants in the same space. Aquaponics helps preserve scarce fresh water, and crops benefit from fish waste fertilizer. To adapt, researchers are looking for plants and fish species more suited to brackish water. Author: Martin Kuebler Experts believe that COP meetings are not only not superfluous, but that they will be needed in the coming years\u00a0\u00a0 to establish a fair way of how to reach these targets . Given that developed countries have fallen short of their promises to reduce emissions, they need to find a way to make up for that so that developing countries are not bearing the brunt, Ryfisch said.\u00a0 \"We have to understand that there is a need for development in many countries, but it cannot take the same fossil fuel-intense path that the Global North has taken,\" he said. Parker said that was why it's of the utmost importance for developed countries to show solidarity and financially support developing countries. \"So that's another test of Paris,\" he said. Ryfisch is optimistic, though, that the Paris Agreement will hold up to the test.\u00a0 \"Over the past years, I've seen the turning point. I see the acceleration of the action and I see that things are happening and that finally, COP is delivering what we would have hoped it had delivered already in the past decades,\" he said. With the plans currently on the table, we are gearing up for an increase of 2.7 degrees Celsius.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate protection is high on the public agenda and EU finance ministers want to get in on the discussion. They have many ideas on carbon dioxide emissions pricing, but are yet to find an answer, reports Bernd Riegert.

The country is paying compensation for all the flights required during its six-month presidency. The money is earmarked for fostering environmental projects and planting trees. It's not entirely clear if all the finance ministers are impressed by the message. After all, nothing concrete will be decided at this informal meeting in Helsinki; the intention is to start a fundamental discussion. The EU, says German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, must find a way to put a sensible price on carbon dioxide emissions, optimally on an international level. \"I believe we are currently in a situation where many say 'we'd like to do something on a national level, but no one else is.'\" Scholz thinks it's the right moment to act together and find out if consensus can't eventually be found, saying, \"That would be a big step forward.\" German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz says the EU must find a way to put a sensible price on carbon dioxide emissions New tariffs or taxes to protect the environment? The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, submitted a broad palette of possible methods for determining the price for climate damaging emissions in order to collect money to invest in climate protection. The EU estimates that trillions, not billions, will be needed in the coming fight against climate change. Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission's new president, wants to invest \u20ac1 trillion in green technologies during the coming budgetary period, which ends in 2027.\u00a0A quarter of EU budget expenditures during that time will be linked to climate protection. Read more: \u00a0 Is Sweden's no-fly movement just media hype? The new Commission, which will begin work in November, hopes to introduce a kind of tariff on carbon dioxide. The plan envisions assessing the sustainability of imports from third countries. Those with poor ratings will then be taxed accordingly. France is in favor of the plan, viewing it as a means of bolstering European competitiveness vis-a-vis China and the US. But German Finance Minister Scholz doesn't seem to be a fan of the proposal.\u00a0He finds the scheme complicated and is worried that it could lead to new trade conflicts with the US and China. Yet, the European lobby association BusinessEurope is of the view that the concept of a duty or import tariff for environmentally damaging products is workable. 'We can't pretend that green debt isn't debt,'\u00a0says European Commissioner Dombrovskis Expand emissions trading? Austrian Finance Minister Eduard M\u00fcller is also not opposed to such a plan, but he warns that getting there won't be easy. \"We have a World Customs Organization, we have binding contracts,\"\u00a0he said, adding: \"Nevertheless, we have to start the conversation.\" Scholz is intent on expanding the current emissions trading system to include smaller companies and even consumers. \"We have a very successful European emissions trading system that applies to large industrial corporations. We are currently trying to figure out how we can limit carbon use in connection with mobility, agriculture, waste management, heating and small businesses.\" The finance minister also suggested the idea of EU-wide taxes on airline tickets, like those charged in Germany. Moreover, EU finance ministers are pondering how to bolster rail transport , for instance by lower value added taxes (VAT) for tickets. Environmental groups have long criticized Germany for exempting international airline tickets from VAT, as well as the fact that airline fuel is taxed less than gasoline and diesel. Excluding investments from debts and deficits? Several southern EU countries have called for excluding debt incurred through investments in climate protection measures from the governments' balance sheets. Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commissioner in charge of ensuring the stability of the euro, is opposed to the idea. \"We can't pretend that green debt isn't debt,\"\u00a0says Dombrovskis. He said that \"a certain amount of flexibility\"\u00a0could be shown with the repayment of such debt. \"We have done that in the past, especially in the case of Italy.\" The finance ministers of France and Luxembourg urged more German support when it comes to financing investments in climate-friendly projects. Olaf Scholz is clearly under pressure to invest some of Germany's huge budget surplus. The European Central Bank also let those gathered in Helsinki know that Germany's fiscal situation remains strong, and that it should invest its surplus in such projects.\u00a0The German finance minister, however, declined to comment publicly. This week, during budget debates, he told Germany's parliament he had billions to invest in public infrastructure projects in the event that the country went into recession. With Germany set to miss its climate goals by a wide margin, a solution might be right next door.

{"id": null, "body": "     A recent report shows rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere are about to make the world's oceans uninhabitable for many sea creatures, threatening entire ocean ecosystems. What can be done? Life on Earth began at sea. Over the billions of years since, the oceans have sustained a myriad of species, from world's biggest mammals to the psychedelic profusion of life that makes up a coral reef. But since the industrial revolution, the waters that cover more than two-thirds of our planet's surface have become increasingly hostile to their inhabitants. Overfishing, plastic pollution and warming waters all make it harder for marine life to survive. But now, perhaps the biggest threat is also one of the most insidious effects of the carbon we pump into the atmosphere \u2013 ocean acidification . Altering ocean chemistry Ulf Riebesell at the GEOMAR center for ocean research in Kiel explains that oceans absorb up to quarter of carbon emissions. \"The CO2 reacts with the seawater to form carbonic acid. The more CO2 the ocean takes up, the more acidified it gets,\" he says. Ulf Riebesell says ocean acidification is global warming's \"evil brother\" For the last eight years, Riebesell has led the German Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification (BIOACID) research program. Its findings were presented at the 23rd UN climate change talks that took place in Bonn, Germany . The Fijian presidency at the climate conference was instrumental in launching the Ocean Pathway \u00a0partnership, intended to increase the profile of ocean issues in climate talks. Riebesell calls ocean acidification global warming's \"evil brother\" because the two are inextricably linked. Normal levels of CO2 reacting with seawater would present no problem. But atmospheric levels of CO2 have not been normal for some time \u2013 and hit a record high in 2016, according to the World Meteorological Organization. That's bringing ocean acidity to dangerous levels, too. Lose-lose situation \"Acidification continues, but also the ocean loses what we call its buffer capacity,\" Riebesell says. \"The more acidified it gets, the less CO2 it actually takes up.\" With the oceans absorbing less CO2, more is left in the atmosphere, accelerating global warming, in a lose-lose situation for both the seas and the atmosphere. Healthy seawater has an average pH-level of 8.2. Since the industrial revolution it has fallen to 8.1. That might not sound like much, but it represents a full 26-percent drop from pre-industrial levels. Floating laboratories called mesocoms allow scientists to simulate changes in ocean chemistry Entire ecosystems at risk Allanah Paul, one of the GEOMAR researchers, has seen the effects of increased acidification on marine life firsthand, using a floating laboratory off the coast of Norway called a mesocosm. \"We enclose the water, like a plastic bag that's lowered down so we can simulate changes in the seawater chemistry,\" she explains. GEOMAR researcher Allanah Paul has witnessed the effects of simulated ocean acidification \"The whole ecosystem responds to these changes. A good example is calcifying organisms. When you lower the seawater pH, they have to use more energy to build their calcium cabinet shell, because these dissolve in seawater that has a lower pH.\" Calcifying organisms include corals, crustaceans, mollusks \u2013 including clams, sea snails and mussels \u2013 and some types of plankton struggle to build their skeletons in acidic waters. Threats to these species have a knock-on effect on the creatures that depend on them for food or shelter. Seafood off the menu And that includes people. The oyster industry off the coast of the US state of Oregon has already been hit by ocean acidification. And fish could be a risk, too \u2013 both from the direct effects of acidification on their development early in life, and from its effect on the species they prey on. Riebesell and his team tested the impact on juvenile polar cod. \"What we've seen is that their survival has decreased by 50 percent if they're exposed to even moderate increased CO2 concentrations,\" he says. Beqa Lagoon in the Fiji Islands has already been killed by elevated sea temperatures \"The future populations of cod might be down to one quarter to one twelfth of their size today \u2013 which will have massive impact on cod fisheries.\" Corrosive effect on polar life Because cold waters dissolve more CO2 than warmer seas, life in the polar regions is hit particularly hard by acidification. \"These waters will become corrosive, meaning they will have conditions where calcium carbonate shells and skeletons just start to dissolve,\" Riebesell explains. \"A lot of organisms will not be able to survive under those conditions in the Arctic and the Antarctic. Biodiversity will drop down strongly in the polar areas.\" Some Arctic waters are already corrosive, and Riebesell and his colleagues have calculated that most surface waters in the Antarctic will become corrosive within a few decades, at current rates of CO2 emissions. No time to adapt As with the effects of manmade global warming, changes to ocean chemistry are happening faster than other species can keep pace with. The latest research shows the current rate of acidification is more than 10 times faster than at any time in the past 55 million years. That means many species will have no chance of adapting to their new environment through evolution. The scientists behind the BIOACID report warn the only way to halt further ocean acidification is a drastic cut in CO2 emissions. Yet even if the world manages to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees , Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) it may not be enough to stop further acidification. As global warming speeds up, so does the rise in sea levels. While 2004 to 2010 saw oceans rise by about 15 millimeters in total, this value doubled for 2010 to 2016. Tropical regions in the western Pacific are especially affected, threatening many of the coastal areas and low-lying islands with submersion by the end of the century. As ocean and atmospheric temperatures increase, glaciers and ice caps shrink in size. In 2016, the global sea ice extent was 4 million square kilometers (1.54 million square miles) below average. Consequently, more meltwater flows into rivers and oceans, which also causes sea levels to rise. Some ocean regions have already warmed by more than 3 degrees Celsius, upsetting marine ecosystems. Seventy-two percent of demersal fish species in the northeast Atlantic Ocean have so far been affected, with warming limiting their abundance and spread. Species that live in tropical ocean waters, like the clownfish, are also experiencing habitat-related population decreases. Warming and acidifying waters affect Nemo's navigation senses, and also threaten his home - coral reefs, one of the most sensitive marine ecosystems. A water temperature increase of as much as 3 degrees Celsius can cause the death of corals and the marine animal species that live in them. Northern parts of Great Barrier Reef have seen coral mortality rates of 50 percent. With increased ocean heat, extremely strong tropical storms are set to occur much more frequently. One of these massive storms was Hurricane Matthew, which hit Haiti in October 2016. The Haitian government put the official death toll at 546, and the hurricane also caused $15 billion (13.8 billion euros) in economic losses on the island nation and in the US, Cuba and the Bahamas. There is a strong correlation between atmospheric wind patterns and ocean temperatures, meaning warming waters may also cause the jet stream to get stronger. This could affect airplane travel due to intensified head- and tailwinds. On the upside, this means that some flights may be much faster. On the downside, other flights may take longer and could experience more turbulence. Author: Jessie-May Franken Plastic pollution and overfishing may currently be in the headlines. But rising CO2 emissions are also a key threat to the ocean that covers 71 percent of the planet, and a major challenge for future life on Earth.

They followed three weeks of warm and wet weather that had left soils in two German states nearly saturated. Unable to soak up such large quantities of water in a short space of time, the ground quickly flooded when a record-breaking 93 mm (3.7 inches) of rain fell over a single day around Germany's Ahr and Erft rivers, and 106 mm fell over two days in Belgium's Meuse region. Rivers burst their banks, breaking bridges and cutting off roads. People asleep in their homes \u2014 many warned late by authorities \u2014 were left with little time to evacuate. When such weather strikes, WWA researchers run computer models fed by historical data to quantify the role climate change played in a disaster \u2014 working against the clock before journalists, policymakers and the public have forgotten about it. The scientists release their results before submitting their research for peer review so they can draw conclusions in a matter of weeks, instead of waiting months or years. The study found that climate change made the rains stronger and more likely. At the lower end of the study's range, it made the rains at least 20% more likely and 3% stronger. At the higher end, it made them nine\u00a0times more likely and 19% stronger. The floods covered towns and villages across Germany with dirty water The level of rain was so rare and fell over such a small area\u00a0that it is \"extremely hard\" to attribute such a specific event to climate change, said Matthias Mengel, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), who was not involved with the study. The WWA scientists instead broadened their analysis to include data from across western Europe. \"At the most general level the study is conclusive: Climate warming increased the chance and the strength of such events,\" Mengel said. Beneath the complex climate shifts that make rainfall difficult to attribute is a simple principle of physics: Hotter air holds more moisture. The Earth has already warmed at least 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century \u2014 Germany by almost 2 C \u2014 and scientists project that heavy rains will continue to grow heavier still as the planet heats up. One of the districts hit by the most rain was the Oberbergischer Kreis, near the western German city of Cologne, which received\u00a0150 mm of rain in 72 hours.\u00a0 \"We thought we knew the situation because we have light floods every now and then,\" said Christian Kettler, a managing director at SN Maschinenbau, a company exporting packing machines that was hit when the Wupper River\u00a0overflowed its banks. \"What was special this time was the speed and suddenness and quantity [of rain] that came.\"\u00a0 Scientists from the government-funded research group Climate Service Center Germany project that, if emissions rise so high as to heat the planet by 4-5 C, the number of days with more than 20 mm of rainfall will rise in the Oberbergischer Kreis from nearly 11 per year to 14. That's a greater increase than in any other of Germany's 401 districts bar one. Sinzig was one of the towns hardest-hit by the floods In the nearby Ahrweiler district, public prosecutors have brought a lawsuit against local authorities for negligent homicide after 12 people with disabilities drowned in a residential home in the town of Sinzig . \"They couldn't get out, they were trapped inside,\" said Jean-Marie Dumaine, who runs a nearby restaurant for which the residents of the home had grown herbs. The WWA study highlights that people with disabilities are among the most vulnerable to floods. The Ahr River\u00a0had grown dangerous, like a big boa constrictor, said Dumaine.\u00a0\"Like a snake that had eaten and whose stomach contained a bomb of water. A tsunami.\"\u00a0 In recent years WWA studies have confirmed links between climate change and several extreme events across the world. Most recently, they established that the deadly heat wave in Canada and the US in June was made 150 times more likely and about 2 C hotter than it would have been in a world without fossil fuels. Before that, they had shown that climate change exacerbated the Australian wildfires in 2019 and 2020, the European heat waves in 2018 and 2019\u00a0and Tropical Storm Imelda, which hit the US in 2019.\u00a0 Not every attribution study finds a link. Sometimes that's because there isn't enough data to detect the influence of climate change amid natural variation. But other times, it's because hotter temperatures alter the climate in complex ways that simultaneously increase and decrease the likelihood of extremes. The net result sometimes defies global trends. WWA scientists found climate change made the North American heat wave in June 150 times more likely A study published in the journal Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society \u00a0in 2014,\u00a0when attribution science was just kicking off, did not find a climate link when heavy summer rains led to flooding on the Danube and Elbe rivers in Germany the previous year.\u00a0 But since then, the research has come a long way. A landmark report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in August found that, if the world warms 4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, heavy rains that used to hit once a decade will hit nearly three times as often and carry 30% more rain. Western and central Europe will be exposed to increasingly extreme rainfall and flooding. \"[The flooding in Europe] demonstrates once again in 2021 that extremes breaking observed records by far, exacerbated by climate change, can strike anywhere, induce huge damages and cause fatalities,\" said Frank Kreienkamp from the German Meteorological Service and a co-author of the WWA study in a press statement. World leaders are failing to deliver on their promises to limit global warming World leaders in 2015 pledged to limit global warming to ideally 1.5 C by the end of the century in a bid to prevent the climate from growing more chaotic and less hospitable to human life. But they are currently pursuing policies that put it on track for 3 C. While the death toll from weather extremes has fallen for decades \u2014 as increasingly accurate computer models have allowed scientists to predict bad weather before it happens \u2014 the number of people displaced by such disasters has risen. Much of the shift has happened in countries like Bangladesh and China, which have built flood defenses, set up early-warning systems and developed sophisticated evacuation plans to swiftly move people out of harm's way. But many evacuees do not have homes or livelihoods to go back to. That has also proven true in Germany. \"Events seen this summer in the Ahr and Erft and the Meuse region will become stronger and more frequent in the future,\" said PIK scientist Mengel. \"We need to stabilize the global climate to stop the trends of more severe and frequent extremes.\" The water is slowly receding, but the disaster is far from over. In devastated riverside towns in Germany, people are only slowly working their way through dealing with what the flood has left behind: bulks of mud and piles of rubbish. The flood completely destroyed Jutta Schelleckes' apartment. She and her injured husband had been living in the mess for two days before firefighters arrived and decided to escort them out of their apartment and help them find shelter. Jutta is only one of the thousands of citizens whose homes have become uninhabitable. What used to be people's furniture and household items has now turned into waste that fills up the streets. If not removed quickly, the waste can hinder rescue operations and impose safety risks to relief workers and residents. The mud can dry into a rock-hard surface that glues rubble to the streets. With volunteers' help, residents have started to clean up their battered homes and shops. Garbage trucks drive back and forth to remove the aftermath's waste from the streets. In Trier, one of the severely affected regions, 14,000 tons of flood waste was collected during the weekend, the spokesperson of the region's waste management association told public broadcaster SWR. In addition to an army of volunteers in disaster zones, countless solidarity initiatives were created to collect donations. The flow of donations quickly became overwhelming, to the extent that several aid organizations announced they have no more capacity to receive more donations. While the COVID pandemic has kept people apart, the disaster has brought communities in the region together.

Sitting back and doing nothing to stop global warming is becoming less and less of an option, as more and more citizens seek redress in the highest courts.\n Top courts recently passed judgements forcing oil companies and governments to do more to prevent climate change. Up to now, the enormous power of the petrochemicals industry has gone largely unhindered. But some environmental organizations and activists are no longer prepared to accept that. Felix Ekardt, head of the Research Unit Sustainability and Climate Policy in Leipzig and Berlin, has filed several suits with Germany\u2019s Constitutional Court. In his opinion, the German government\u2019s Federal Climate Change Act is too lax. Judges at Germany\u2019s top constitutional court agreed, in part, with Ekardt and his co-plaintiffs. They ruled that long-term measures were required to achieve zero emissions and that the German state needed to do more to achieve that goal. More and more environmental cases are coming before the courts - worldwide: There have been similar verdicts in France, the Netherlands and New Zealand.\u00a0 The Paris Agreement aims to limit the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The agreement is binding. But up to now the climate accord has not actually led to major structural change.

{"id": null, "body": "     World leaders and climate activists are in agreement that something has to change to avoid a climate crisis. It remains to be seen if they will follow through. Activists, world leaders and civil society responded on Monday to the new ominous report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that warned that the world is on track to surpass the warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0within 15 years. The report laid out the undeniability of human emissions being the cause of the rise in temperature, which has already sparked environmental catastrophes around the world. The planet has already warmed up by 1.1 degrees and just a handful of countries are on course to reduce their emissions to a sufficient extent. However, as climate activist Greta Thunberg pointed out, the report \"contains no real surprises.\" \"It confirms what we already know from thousands previous studies and reports \u2014 that we are in an emergency,\" the 18-year-old wrote on Twitter. \"We can still avoid the worst consequences, but not if we continue like today, and not without treating the crisis like a crisis,\" she added. In light of the report, Thunberg told Reuters news agency\u00a0she now plans to attend the upcoming UN climate conference in Scotland. She'd previously said she would boycott the conference due to the unequal rollout of COVID vaccines around the world. Nigerian activist Oladosu Adenike had a similar response to Thunburg, writing on Twitter that \"the commitments from world leaders aren't enough to tackle the current projections of the impact.\" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the report a \"code red\" for humanity, adding that it \"must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy the planet.\" The US government's Climate Envoy, John Kerry, said the IPCC report shows that \"we cannot afford further delay,\" adding that \"climate change is transforming our planet in unprecedented ways, with far-reaching effects that we are already seeing \u2013 making heatwaves, extreme rainfall, fire weather, and droughts more frequent and severe.\" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is facing pressure at home to stop the planned opening of a coal mine, said in reaction to the report: \"We know what must be done to limit global warming \u2013 consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the frontline.\" The EU's chief for the European Green Deal Frans Timmermann joined in the chorus\u00a0on Twitter, saying that \"it's not too late\u2026 if we act decisively now.\" Earlier in the day, German politicians also urged for increased cooperation to tackle the crisis, including a global green deal to expand renewable energies.\u00a0 Friederike Otto, one of the author's of the report, spoke to DW about its conclusions, stating that \"it is a fact: there is no uncertainty that human greenhouse gas emissions are the cause of the warming we observe.\" She explained that we can expect to see more extreme weather and climate events, such as heatwaves, flooding and droughts, that we are already observing. \"In addition to that, what we will also, no matter at what level we constrain global mean temperature rise, continue to observe further sea level rise for decades and centuries to come, and also glacial melt, because these are the slow responding parts of the climate system,\" Otto added. She also emphasized that the report is about the climate science which provides governments with the data they need for policy decisions, but does not make any policy recommendations. But if we want to limit warming to just 1.5 degrees, then we \"have to reach net-zero by the middle of the century.\" The European Space Agency's Climate Office spoke to DW about the IPCC report and the recent wildfires in southern Europe. Climate expert Clement Albergel said that the new report \"echoes previous findings linking human activities, greenhouse gas emissions in particular, and climate change.\" In reference to the fires that have devastated large parts of Greece, Turkey and Italy in recent days, he said: \"When high temperatures are combined with low humidity, low rainfall and/or high winds there is an increased risk of wildfire... This combination of conditions is now observed over a longer period of time over much of the world... and is linked to climate change.\" \"Under a warming climate, extreme events such as prolonged heatwaves and droughts are likely to increase both in intensity and frequency, this is a proven fact,\" Albergel added. Many regions in Russia have been burning for weeks, with the area around Yakutia in the far northeast having been hit particularly hard. The authorities have counted more than 250 fires currently burning across Russia, covering a total area of more than 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres). But it's not just the fires that are causing problems for locals. Dense smoke has been drifting across populated areas, for example the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. This is especially hard for the elderly and children, as it's nearly impossible to breathe outside. Evacuees on a ferry at the port of Pefki, Euboea \u2014 they are embarking on a journey into the unknown, as their homes and belongings will probably be destroyed by the time they return. For the first time since the forest fires started on the Greek island of Euboea at the beginning of last week, massive air missions are now being flown to fight the fires. Eyewitnesses report apocalyptic scenes. But not everyone is fleeing \u2014 many local residents want to support the firefighters. At times, that can include desperate acts \u2014 such as with this man, who\u2019s trying to beat out flames with a tree branch. Such autonomous actions are causing a major problem for the authorities, as through them, many people are placing themselves in grave danger. Besides Greece and Italy, Turkey is also struggling with devastating fires. Walls of fire are spreading from the forests to residential areas. On this photo, Turkish firefighters are trying to stop a blaze near Cokertme that threatens to spread into buildings. More than 150,000 hectares \u2014 including entire villages \u2014 have already fallen victim to the flames in Turkey. More than 5,700 fires are currently raging in the West Coast state of California \u2014 and the typical wildfire season there has not even started yet. The Dixie Fire is now the second-largest in the state's history, and completely destroyed the town of Greenville. In this photo, a fire crew member keeps an eye out for spot fires to slow the wildfire near the town of Westwood. In California, whirlwinds of ash and embers, such as this one that meandered through the Santa Barbara hills, are complicating matters. West Coast fires have even been creating their own weather. With the situation more devastating than in previous years, governors of affected states have turned to Washington for help \u2014 they are urgently seeking more emergency staff and firefighting aircraft.

{"id": null, "body": "     Equity investors, known for their myopic views, have been eternal procrastinators when it comes to climate risks. Tesla's meteoric rise shows that they may be finally smelling the coffee, says DW's Ashutosh Pandey. Elon Musk has surpassed Amazon's Jeff Bezos as the world's richest person Tesla's market value has risen over 750% in the past year , valuing the electric vehicle maker and renewable energy company at around $800 billion (\u20ac657 billion) \u2014 more than the combined market cap of the nine largest car companies globally. This despite the carmaker's selling fewer than 500,000 cars a year, a fraction of what Toyota or Volkswagen sell. Tesla's stock has stood out in what has been an incredible year for global markets. While the likes of Apple, Amazon, Zoom, Netflix and the other \"stay-at-home\" stocks benefited from the popularity of their products during the pandemic, no one reason explains Tesla's tearaway performance. In fact, there are plenty, including Tesla's potential to disrupt the auto industry, rising demand for electric vehicles, and retail investors coming to the party or even pure speculation. But one reason must offer a lot of hope to climate activists. It's that investors are increasingly realizing that a company selling cars that don't run on polluting fossil fuels is a key piece of the puzzle in combating climate change. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who has become the world's richest person thanks to the share rally, is essentially being rewarded for trailblazing a path toward\u00a0a sustainable future \u2014 a journey that\u00a0traditional automakers have also embarked upon, albeit reluctantly, after having postponed the inevitable for years.\u00a0 DW financial correspondent Ashutosh Pandey Investors are betting that Tesla's colossal lead over rivals in terms of technology, design and brand value would help it dominate the market when combustion engines are eventually phased out as part of efforts by several countries to become carbon-neutral over the next two to three decades.\u00a0\u00a0 Their optimism has been backed by generous incentives from governments, including here in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel last year snubbed traditional carmakers \u2014 a longtime darling of Berlin \u2014 by refusing to dole out any incentives\u00a0for the purchase of conventional petrol and diesel cars. Instead, Merkel's largesse \u2014 a discount of up to \u20ac10,000 ($12,200) \u2014 was reserved for electric vehicles with a \"view on the future.\" Tesla is by no means an exception; shares in companies with stronger environmental, social and governance credentials have been lapped up by investors over the past few months. Solar power company Enphase, Chinese battery carmaker Nio and fuel cell maker Plug Power have all had a dream run rivaling or even eclipsing Tesla's. There are encouraging signs even on the debt front. Green bond issuance shattered records amid global turmoil, surpassing $1 trillion last year, according to research company BloombergNEF.\u00a0 The massive demand for green bonds \u2014 which are used to fund environmental projects \u2014 meant that companies like Volkswagen and Daimler could raise money from the markets at a much cheaper cost to fund their electric push. This effectively means that investors are beginning to charge a premium for non-green bonds.\u00a0 \u00a0 Investors have largely been ignoring climate risks despite the economic damage from climate disasters rising in recent years. The International Monetary Fund has warned that investors globally have been underestimating the economic fallouts from climate change. It predicts natural disasters such as wildfires, floods, droughts and storms may cost $1 trillion\u00a0annually starting in 2050. But the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have\u00a0 forced investors to smell the coffee . The unprecedented economic damage unleashed by the pandemic shows just how costly being unprepared for major crises could prove to be. It's a shame that we needed a pandemic of this scale to force investors to pause and think about the urgency to avert climate change. Let's hope this serendipitous realization survives well beyond the current crisis when oil producers and airlines return to their polluting ways with full force. The investor community still has a long way to go to burnish their green credentials. Elon Musk's Tesla produces cars, but on the stock exchange, it gets treated like a tech high flier. Musk's firm has profited from the market hype around tech stocks during the pandemic and from investors betting on a greener future. The South African-born entrepreneur has overtaken Amazon's Jeff Bezos as the world's richest person with a total worth of $195 billion (\u20ac160 billion). Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (pictured with his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez in front of the Taj Mahal) is in a class of his own. His e-commerce company has done brisk business during the pandemic, pushing Amazon shares to new records. Bezos, who is worth $185 billion, would have remained the world's richest person had it not been for a $38 billion divorce settlement in 2019. The growing number of people working from home during the pandemic is a big boon for Eric Yuan. The founder of Zoom moved from China to the US when he was 27-years-old. After some years with rival WebEx, he launched his own video communications platform, with Zoom going public in 2019. Since the coronavirus crisis, shares have exploded. Yuan is estimated to own some $17 billion. Distancing rules and closed workout studios have played into the hands of John Foley. Back in 2013, he was still touting his connected workout equipment at Kickstarter. Today, people are willing to spend a lot on Peloton's at-home gym equipment. The company's shares have tripled during the pandemic, unexpectedly turning the almost 50-year-old Foley into a billionaire. Shopify enables traders to create their own online shops \u2014 a concept developed by Tobias L\u00fctke. Born in Koblenz, Germany, he emigrated to Canada in 2002 and started out in a garage like so many other North Americans. Meanwhile, Shopify is Canada's most valuable enterprise, with its share price having doubled since March. Forbes magazine says 39-year-old L\u00fctke is worth some $10 billion. As early as January this year, Ugur Sahin started backing the right horse by working on a COVID-19 vaccine. The drug developed by his Germany-based company BioNTech could soon secure medical approval. The vaccine has pushed Sahin, who hails from Turkey, into the public spotlight and made him super-rich. The value of the shares he holds is estimated to be $5 billion. Food services company HelloFresh is booming. Profits have more than tripled during the pandemic, figures from the latest quarterly earnings report showed in early November. Co-founder and shareholder Dominik Richter has been making the most of restaurants being closed. He's not quite in the same league as the richest pandemic profiteers, but he's got the right ingredients to catch up with them. Jeff Bezos isn't the only one who's grown even richer through Amazon. Thanks to the shares she owns, Bezos' ex-wife MacKenzie Scott hit it big and climbed to top spot on the world's richest women list. She's estimated to be worth some $56 billion and obviously happened to be with the right partner at the right time.

But the euphoric celebrations in Paris now seem a distant memory.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United Nations' 190-plus states had finally wrestled together an agreement that the Earth's temperature shouldn't rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.

It wasn't long before he withdrew from the climate treaty. \"As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people,\" Trump said at a press conference in the garden of the White House, claiming that the climate agreement would hurt the US economy and jobs and undermine the country's sovereignty. Trump abandoned his country's commitment to the Paris treaty, saying it would hurt US interests. Others, including Iraq, Iran and Russia, are yet to ratify the treaty. And in Australia and Brazil , right-wing and nationalist governments have gained power, pushing climate protection\u00a0off the agenda. Meanwhile, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a body of around 900 scientists from around the world, warns that cutting emissions couldn't be more urgent.

Eastern European countries in particular fear that cutting emissions will hurt their economies. \"The EU has actually always been an important and constructive player in these negotiations, something of a pioneer in climate diplomacy,\" Lutz Weischer of environmental group Germanwatch told DW. \"But it's just too tentative, too weak, and should actually set itself higher goals for Katowice.\" In fact, EU countries are\u00a0 struggling to meet their own climate targets for 2020 . In Germany, for example, greenhouse gas emissions have been on the rise again. \"The countries that are doing the most [to curb climate change] at the moment are the countries most affected by climate change,\" Weischer said. \"There is a coalition of small island states and poor developing countries that have the goal of using only renewable energy. Countries that are under strong pressure from the fossil fuel industry, such as the US and Saudi Arabia , are slowing down.\" Weischer points out that technology has made huge leaps forward, with renewable power now competitive with fossil fuels and electric mobility offering a real alternative to the combustion engine. But governments need to join together and put their foot on the accelerator. \"The climate protection train can no longer be derailed,\" he said, adding, \"the problem is that this train is not running fast enough.\" A protester's hands covered in crude oil during a 2011 protest against Royal Dutch Shell after pipeline spills in Nigeria, in 2008 and 2009. Shell allegedly ignored advice to replace the outdated Trans Niger Pipeline, which ruptured and inundated villages in Ogoniland with thousands of barrels of oil. Anti-pipeline movements have been around for decades, and are joining up across the globe. Militants from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) patrol the oil-rich creeks of the Niger Delta of Nigeria in September 2008. MEND militants were alleged to have sabotaged and destroyed crude oil pipelines run by the likes of Shell and Chevron, which they say bring little benefit to local communities and cause massive local environmental destruction. Police stand guard at the entrance of Peru's national oil company in Lima, August 2016, where activists placed a coffin filled with items painted in black to represent a contaminated environment. The state oil company Petroperu has admitted to numerous spills in the old and extensive pipeline system that transports oil from the Amazon to the Pacific coast. TransCanada's Tamazunchale Pipeline met with resistance in Mexico during its construction through the country's mountainous and fertile southern region. Several Mexican indigenous communities have joined forces to fight the pipeline. The wall painting here reads: \"No to the gas pipeline, we're an indigenous community and demand respect.\" Opponents of the Dakota Access oil pipeline march out of their main camp in North Dakota in February 2017. The anti-pipeline resistance movement that gathered on Standing Rock Sioux tribal lands became a social media phenomenon under the #NoDAPL hashtag, galvanizing global resistance against attempts to expand the flow of climate change-inducing fossil fuels. A Native American woman recovers after being pepper-sprayed by police after she and other protesters sought to build a new camp to block construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in late 2016. While the #NoDAPL movement did not succeed in preventing the pipeline from being built, it focused attention on the topic and drew together social justice and environmental movements. More than 10,000 people march in British Columbia in March 2018 to protest Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline, which is to transport tar sands oil to the west coast of Canada and on to Asian markets. After months of protests led by First Nations and environmental activists, the pipeline company halted construction in April. Lakota spiritual leader Chief Arvol Looking Horse demonstrates outside the White House in 2015 against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. US Republicans authorized the pipeline \u2014 but in November 2018, a court again blocked its construction. In March 2017, after Italy's State Council permitted construction of Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), demonstrators in Puglia southern Italy clashed with police to protest removal of 1,600 centuries-old olive trees. Several were injured. A 350.org petition claims TAP will \"destroy Europe's climate targets\" and has \"destructive, unjust impacts on the communities in its path.\" The TAPI (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) gas pipeline project was launched in Herat in western Afghanistan in February 2018, and will carry gas from Turkmenistan to the subcontinent. On hand at the launch were a group of Taliban militants (pictured) insisting they would not sabotage \u2014 as many feared \u2014 but instead assist the pipeline project.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate deniers are using a spell of unusually cold weather in Europe to incorrectly argue that CO2 emissions are not warming the planet. Large parts of Germany have been blanketed in snow As Germans shiver through double-digit negative temperatures and more than 80 centimeters (30 inches) of snow in parts of the country, climate science deniers have taken to social media to argue that global warming is a hoax. Their claim \u2014 which has been repeatedly debunked by climate scientists \u2014 is that extremely cold weather shows that\u00a0carbon dioxide emissions are not warming the Earth. In fact, the effects of global warming may even have favored the extremely cold temperature. As early as December, experts had an inkling about winter weather conditions this year. The polar vortex low-pressure area in the far north became unstable, allowing Arctic air masses to move to Europe. The result: snow, freezing rain and above all, plummeting temperatures in Germany. The sub-zero conditions could hold for the next two weeks. They restock the supermarket shelves, but when the low-pressure area named \"Tristan\" moves across the country, you don't want to be driving behind a truck. In snow and slush, the rigs soon reach their limits. Many people spent the night in their cars in the freezing cold, stranded on highway A2 near Bielefeld. Traffic was backed up for 37 kilometers (23 miles). \"Tristan\" has dumped large amounts of snow on regions that are not very familiar with these types of weather conditions, including up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) of new snow in the lowlands of the eastern German state of Saxony. It\u2019s a busy time for snow plows, as here in the city of Leipzig (photo). These windmills in Kinderdijk, near Rotterdam, have not been working for some time, but now, public life in the Netherlands is also partly grinding to a halt. Elementary schools were closed in many towns at the beginning of the week, only a few trains are running, and police have urged people not to use their cars. Meteorologists agree that, at least for a while, the cold has come to stay. As a rule, the weather in Belgium comes in from the west, but \"Tristan\" snuck in from the east, bringing snow and cold to the Belgian capital, Brussels. The situation is not as chaotic as expected, but the German meteorologist J\u00f6rg Kachelmann's assessment applies to Belgium, too: \"A block of cold air has settled with a big butt and is barely budging.\" The onset of winter does not come as a surprise to people in Poland. In Warsaw, people are quite familiar with frigid low-pressure systems from the east. In parts of the country, the snow has turned to rain, making the streets as slippery as glass. The lowest temperatures are currently being recorded in Lower Silesia and Opole, where it can be so cold that even salt won't de-ice the roads. The clash of arctic and warmer air masses brought freezing rain and snow to the Czech Republic, too. With temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius, the capital, Prague, remains covered in a blanket of snow.\u00a0\u00a0Great weather for winter sports \u2014 but the Czech ski resorts are closed due to the coronavirus restrictions. Unlike in the Czech Republic, the lifts are busy in many Swiss winter sports resorts. The skiers must wear face masks. While the country wasn't hit by snow masses like in Germany, winter sports fans marveled at snow colored by Sahara sands blown in from Africa by strong winds. While snow and ice dominate central Europe, spring is on its way in the south: A balmy\u00a0\u00a020 degrees Celsius lured people outdoors in Italy over the weekend. Snow is not in sight on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica (photo), either. Author: Andreas Noll The past week's sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfalls are more than just a cold\u00a0winter. They are made more likely by the collapse of the polar vortex \u2014 a huge ring of cold winds raging in the Earth's stratosphere \u2014 at the North Pole.\u00a0 The polar vortex is closely connected to the jet stream, a band of strong winds about 10 kilometers above the ground. At the polar front, this flows between warm air from the tropics and subtropics, and cold polar air. The pressure extremes that form in this transitional area at lower layers are sometimes referred to in weather reports as the Icelandic low or the Azores high.\u00a0\u00a0 The jet stream usually determines the winter weather in Europe: if it is strong and flows from west to east, it brings mild, windy and rainy weather from the Atlantic, and holds the cold air from the Arctic.\u00a0 But if the jet stream is weak and wavy, the polar vortex also weakens, and sometimes breaks down completely. The cold snap across Europe is the result of a weak jet stream \u2014 more precisely a dip \u2014 that has caused a strong and long-lasting collapse of the polar vortex. Through the burning of\u00a0 fossil fuels , people have heated the planet by more than 1 degrees Celsius\u00a0 ( 1.8 F)\u00a0 since the Industrial Revolution.\u00a0 The \u00a0decade\u00a0 from 2010 to 2019 was the hottest on record. Climate change, however,\u00a0 doesn't only lead to\u00a0higher temperatures,\u00a0but more extreme weather. This is where the disproportionate warming of the Arctic comes into play, said Stefan Rahmstorf, head of the Earth System Analysis research department at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). Temperatures in the Arctic have risen more than twice as fast as the global average over the past 40 years. \"These changes are affecting the weather in Europe.\"\u00a0 Scientists on board the research ship Polarstern found unusually weak sea ice in August 2020 Arctic warming is particularly strong in winter, said D\u00f6rthe Handorf, who researches the physics of the atmosphere at the Alfred Wegener Institute of the Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI). \"As many studies show, this weakens the jet stream.\" The wind stream begins to fray, said Handorf, which could lead to more dips that affect temperatures in Europe. Climate change won't necessarily make European winters colder because the outbreaks of cold air from the polar vortex are sometimes milder than the current cold snap. The Arctic is also not the only part of the world where air currents are changing because of rising temperatures. Strong warming over the subtropics also affects the jet stream, said Handorf. While the Arctic warming tends to direct the jet stream southwards and cause cold spells in Europe, the subtropical warming generally sends the band northwards. If this is the case, she said, the winter weather in Europe will be milder. Climate models do not yet know which warming trend will dominate in the future, she added.\u00a0\u00a0 Warmer Arctic air can lower temperatures far to the south The cold spell has hit Europe during COVID-19 lockdowns that have kept people at home Snow forms when warm, moist air meets very cold air. Over the flatlands in western Europe, the air is rarely cold enough for the volume of snowfall\u00a0that has\u00a0blanketed the region this winter. But on this occassion, an\u00a0area of high-pressure air called Gisela brought cold Arctic winds to the center of Germany, where it collided with two low-pressure areas called Tristan and Reinhard. As they were carrying warm sea air, the moisture was turned into snow.\u00a0\u00a0 Because warmer air holds more moisture, rising temperatures mean air masses will transport more water. This moisture can then become snow wherever it gets\u00a0cold enough\u00a0\u2014 typically at higher altitudes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The massive snowfalls in the Alps in the winter of 2019 were also triggered by unusually moist and warm air masses. At that time, said Peter Hoffmann, meteorologist at PIK, the oceans were still quite warm in winter due to the long, hot summer \u2014 and so a lot of water evaporated. The air currents then took it to the Alps, where an enormous amount of wet snow fell at high altitudes, causing chaos on the roads and increasing the risk of avalanches. Soldiers from the German army had to clear roofs after heavy snowfall hit Bischofswiesen, in southern Germany, in 2019 Changes in local weather can be different to changes in the global climate. This can cause confusion. While average temperatures have warmed to record-breaking levels \u2014 making regional heatwaves and wildfires more intense \u2014 climate change does not make temperatures everywhere rise. In the past 20 years, for example, winters in many areas of temperate latitudes have not been much warmer than the long-term average, said Handorf.\u00a0 Complex weather systems\u00a0 such as \u00a0the polar vortex, for instance, could be cooling parts of Europe even as the Arctic warms. And \u00a0though \u00a0February may be \u00a0 particularly cold this year, January \u2014 compared to the long-term average \u2014\u00a0 m ight \u00a0have been too warm.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Although we don't always see warming regionally or locally, we have no signs that global warming is weakening,\" said Handorf. \"On the contrary.\"\u00a0 The changing jet stream also affects summer temperatures, she added. \"There are studies that show we also have a more meandering jet stream in summer. And these meanders, these bulges, tend to remain more stationary.\" In other words, just like a cold spell in winter, the heat can last for an unusually long time in summer.\u00a0 If hot Saharan air then reaches Europe through the jet stream, as it did in June 2019, for example, it can cause a long heat wave. During such scorching weeks and months, it seems obvious that the climate crisis is upon us \u2014 but the same it true when it snows.

{"id": null, "body": "     When faced with a crisis, coming together is the one vehicle of change humans have when it comes to fighting for their future, says social psychologist Stephen Reicher. Human beings all over the world agreed to strict limitations to their rights\u00a0when governments made the decision to enter lockdown during the COVID-19 crisis. Many have done\u00a0it willingly on behalf of the collective. So why can't this same attitude be seen when tackling climate change? Stephen Reicher is a social psychologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where he researches\u00a0collective behavior and\u00a0social identity. DW spoke to him for the second season of the environmental podcast\u00a0 On The Green Fence .\u00a0 DW:\u00a0We've watched the collective move very fast in response to this crisis. Were you amazed by that? Stephen Reicher: At one level, I wasn't. If you look at the literature on what happens in emergencies, the traditional literature plays into this notion of the public as a problem \u2014\u00a0the idea\u00a0that human beings are always psychologically frail and they always have difficulty in dealing with complex information. And under a crisis, they crack, they panic. You would never have a Hollywood disaster film without people running, screaming, waving their hands in the air and blocking the exits. But actually, that isn't what happens in disasters. When people come together, when they have a sense that others will support them, especially in situations of difficulty, then it makes them better able to cope and more psychologically resilient. Collectivity is the resource that allows us to cope practically, but also psychologically, to get through these times.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0 Life after coronavirus: 'We can shape a totally different world' Why was the response to the coronavirus seemingly so easy, particularly when compared to the far more existential threat of climate change? What is the difference between these two? The temporality of the issue, the fact that it is immediate, the ways in which it is tangible and the way in which it is unarguable. If you are talking about the events that are happening now due to climate change and that are killing people, it is probabilistic that climate change was critical to them. The probabilities are very, very high. But it is not immediately self-evident in the same way that it's evident that somebody is dying from coronavirus. These things become arguable. Read more:\u00a0 Coronavirus linked to destruction of wildlife and world's ecosystems And that's where the second factor comes in, which is the political factor. In some places it has been consensual, and it has been pretty positive. And that's because politicians have not tried to argue or mobilize against compliance with medically-necessary measures. In other places, that's not true \u2014\u00a0in the United States, for instance, where Trump has been supporting those in various states who have been calling it a \"lockdown tyranny.\" And in Brazil, and in India. The other absolutely obvious point differentiating coronavirus from climate change are the political differences and the differences in terms of political leadership \u2014\u00a0in terms of a) how we understand what's going on, and b) how we should respond to what's going on. Although climate disasters like the Australian bushfires are strongly linked to climate change, the link isn't as immediate as deaths from coronavirus, says Reicher One example of collective action can be seen in a makeshift donation fence locals in Dresden made to provide immediate help to the homeless during the lockdown If I understood you correctly, if there were general consensus and a general realization that we are facing an existential threat and everybody really believed the science,\u00a0the collective would be moved to action. Is it really that simple or is something else holding us back? At the moment we are acting collectively towards members of our community who are currently alive, and we can see whether they will live or die. It is much more abstract in the sense of climate change\u00a0because we are acting for many of those who are not yet born \u2014\u00a0they might be our children or grandchildren. It's the articulation of the psychological and lived experience with the ideological way in which we make sense of it and explain it and are told how to behave. The reason why the political, in many ways, is more powerful in undermining action on climate change is because it is much more abstract. It is a much less direct experience. Read more:\u00a0 Radical environmentalism: 'We need to be ready to risk our lives' Do we need role models to catalyze change? And if so, what kind of role models? If Greta Thunberg, for instance, can\u2019t pull it off, then who could? We need leadership. I don't think it's entirely coincidental that some of the countries where coronavirus is raging most dangerously are those with toxic leadership, as in the United States, as in Brazil. Whereas in some of those countries which are doing well \u2014\u00a0like New Zealand \u2014\u00a0the leadership takes a very different form indeed.\u00a0 Jacinda Ardern has been credited with keeping COVID-19 numbers low in New Zealand. To date, the country has seen roughly 1,500 cases and 22 deaths The number of cases in the US has surpassed 2.5 million. Critics say President Trump's delayed response is partially to blame Leadership can take many forms. It doesn't have to be traditional. It doesn't have to be hierarchical. It doesn't have to be a single individual. It can be distributed. But you need voices which, firstly, serve to create a sense of community and communal responsibility.\u00a0 Secondly, they need to form a relationship with the public. A leader needs to be seen in many ways as one of us, as acting for us, and as achieving for us, in order to be effective. Leadership is effective to the extent that we believe that a leader is representative of us, understands who we are and what we value. More than ever, we do need good, inclusive leadership that engages with the public rather than imposes on the public. Read more: \u00a0 Plunging solar energy prices spell bright future for clean electricity On a personal level, Steve, if you as a social psychologist could mold the change that we'd need to achieve for a sustainable world, how would you go about putting the collective on the right track? The group is always going to be part of the solution. Groups can do awful things and groups can do magnificent things. The problem doesn't lie in group psychology, per se. It depends on the specific ideologies and cultures that define the groups we belong to. How inclusive or exclusive are they? What are the norms and values that define the nature of our community?\u00a0Are they values of compassion or are they values of strength and domination? Not all groups are good, but that depends upon the group culture. The thing that is absolutely clear, however, is that if you get rid of groups, then you get rid of the one vehicle of change that we've actually got. If you get rid of groups, you freeze the status quo. The power of the powerless lies in their combination. I think we can wield that power for good rather than for ill. The genocidal Nazi dicatorship is the prime historic example of how dangerous the collective can be \u00a0 History also teaches us that the collective is the only vehicle for change we have, says Reicher Read more: Pandemic sheds light on importance of biodiversity Do you think we're going to pull this off? If the science is right, we are running out of time. When it comes to the changes that have to be made, are we going to be magnificent? Are we going to be horrible? There is a problem with the debate that's going on at the moment. Some people are telling us that coronavirus is going to change the world for the good \u2014\u00a0we're going to realize that collectivity is terrible, we're going to realize that precarity is destructive\u00a0and that inequalities kill. And other people are saying, no, no, no, it's going to be completely awful \u2014\u00a0we're all going to be divided,\u00a0we're going have a recession which will pit us\u00a0against each other. The danger of making predictions in those forms is that it gives rise to fatalism. Either you believe it's going be awful so there is nothing you can do about it, or you believe it's going to happen anyway and therefore you don't need to do anything about it. Those were the critiques, for instance, of mechanical forms of Marxism. I don't think there is any inevitable outcome. I'm not a prophet.\u00a0If we want to move forward progressively, we've got to harness the power of the collective. We've got to understand how it's within the collective that we become agents who can actually make and change our own world. To predict is to be counterproductive. It pacifies people. It says \"the future will be like this,\"\u00a0rather than to say \"we need to fight for the future.\" Stephen Reicher is a social psychologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. The interview was conducted by Neil King and Gabriel Borrud for DW's environmental podcast, On the Green Fence.\u00a0 The interview has been edited for length and clarity. As the world grinds to a halt, the sudden shutdown of most industrial activities has dramatically reduced air pollution levels. Satellite images have even revealed a clear drop in global levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gas which is primarily emitted from car engines and commercial manufacturing plants and is responsible for poor air quality in many major cities. Like NO2, carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) have also been slashed in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. When economic activity stalls, so do CO2 emissions \u2014 in fact, the last time this happened was during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In China alone, emissions have fallen by around 25% when the country entered lockdown, according to Carbon Brief. But this change is likely to only be temporary. As everyone retreats to their homes, some animals have been taking advantage of our absence. Reduced road traffic means little critters like hedgehogs emerging from hibernation are less likely to be hit by cars. Meanwhile, other species like ducks may be wondering where all the people have gone and will need to find other sources of food besides breadcrumbs in the park. Conservationists hope the coronavirus outbreak will help curb global wildlife trade, which is responsible for pushing a number of species to the brink of extinction. COVID-19 likely originated in a Wuhan wet market, which sells live produce and is a hub for both legal and illegally trafficked wildlife. A crackdown on trading live wildlife may be one positive thing to come out of the crisis.\u202f\u202f Shortly after Italy entered lockdown, images of crystal clear canals in Venice were shared around the world \u2014 the pristine blue waters are a far cry from their usual muddy appearance. And with cruise ships docked for the time being, our oceans are also experiencing a drop in noise pollution, lowering the stress levels of marine creatures like whales and making for a much more peaceful migration. But it's not all good news. One of the worst environmental side-effects of the coronavirus pandemic is the rapid increase in the use of disposable plastic \u2014 from medical equipment like disposable gloves, to plastic packaging as more people opt for prepackaged foods. Even cafes that remain open no longer accept reusable cups from customers in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. With the coronavirus dominating, the climate crisis has been pushed to the sidelines. But that doesn't make it any less urgent. Experts are warning that important decisions regarding the climate should not be delayed \u2014 even with the UN climate conference postponed until 2021. While emissions have dropped since the pandemic began, we're unlikely to see widespread and long-term change as a result.

{"id": null, "body": "     Merkel is leaving office after 16 years. One of three candidates could succeed her. DW analyzed: What do they talk about in parliament? How do they vote? And what does that mean for their potential chancellorship? Who will succeed Angela Merkel (background)? Depending on the results of Germany's parliamentary election in September, it could be Olaf Scholz (SPD), Armin Laschet (CDU) or Annalena Baebock (Greens). In September 2021, Germany will elect a new federal parliament, and change chancellors, as well. Three major parties have put up candidates hoping to succeed Angela Merkel, who will not run again after 16 years in office. Merkel's own party, the Christian Democrats (CDU), nominated Armin Laschet for the candidacy. Laschet serves as state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. The Greens, meanwhile, made 40-year-old international law expert Annalena Baerbock their candidate, the party's first candidacy with real prospects of success. The Social Democrats (SPD) tipped Finance Minister Olaf Scholz as their top candidate. Voting records provide an overview of how the governing parties have implemented their promises and how the opposition parties have positioned themselves politically. In Germany, several parties usually form a majority coalition that votes unanimously, and whose motions will thus generally pass. Much depends, therefore, on the formation of the next coalition, and the deals struck in the process. For most of her time in office, Merkel oversaw a grand coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD, with the Greens in the opposition. Should the SPD go into the opposition after this election, it could cast its vote separately from the conservatives for the first time since 2013. And should the greens become a government party, they will have to compromise with their coalition partners. So what is each candidate's track record so far? And what does that tell us about Germany's future chancellor? To find the politicians' signature issues, DW assessed the words and phrases each of the candidates use more often than their competitors in parliamentary speeches. In recent years, the CDU chairman has been mostly active in state- and regional-level politics. That focus is reflected in his speeches, in which he mentions his home state and its political institutions more often than his fellow campaigners. His time as Integration and Family Minister from 2005 to 2010 also stands out, with mentions for parents, children and education. Annalena Baerbock's characteristic issues stand out in her parliamentary speeches: She mentions climate policy, Germany\u2019s coal phase-out and Europe more often than her competitors. Her home state of Brandenburg also makes an appearance: Baerbock comes from and is a member of parliament for Potsdam, near Berlin. The SPD politician is active in both state and federal politics. He was mayor of Hamburg from 2011 to 2018 and, accordingly, often speaks about the city and its local politics. As a former labor minister and current finance minister, he mentions workers and the economy more often than the other two candidates. Author: Kira Schacht Whether issues and policy positions of politicians are put into practice is partly decided in the federal and state parliaments. Here, political positions are discussed and new laws voted on. DW gathered all roll-call votes the candidates and Merkel participated in, recorded by the German parliamentary watchdog NGO Abgeordnetenwatch , and manually labeled them by international relevance and policy issue. What is their track record on migration, environmental policy, or European cooperation? Merkel's decision not to close the borders to refugees stranded in Hungary in 2015 was watched around the world. Overall, however, the chancellor's voting record on migration and refugee policy is rather mixed. Less than a quarter of her votes support a more open migration policy. Instead, her governing coalition voted, for example, against deportation stops for Syrian refugees , which the Greens had requested in 2011, or introduced a motion to classify Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Georgia as safe countries of origin in 2019. Political calculations play a big role in such votes, says Ulrich Sieberer , professor of empirical political science at the University of Bamberg: \"99% of the time, votes are about positioning yourself in the conflict between government and opposition.\" Opposition parties such as the Greens can introduce motions to parliament, but these have no chance of success without the support of the governing coalition. But they still serve a purpose, says Sieberer: \"From the opposition's point of view, it's an instrument to present one's own position to the voters, and to show up the government by occasionally forcing them to reject something popular.\" The SPD knows this dynamic well: As the CDU's coalition partner, the party often faces accusations of voting against its proclaimed ideals. \"At the end of the day, the parties stand together for the government line and, of course, have to be measured against it to some extent,\" Sieberer says. \"But, at the same time, of course, the battle over interpretation begins immediately.\" Parties might claim to have wanted a different outcome, but to have been forced to make concessions to the coalition partner. The Greens could be in that very position after the election. Should they become part of a government coalition, they would have to vote differently. \"They will only introduce motions that are sure to have the support of the coalition,\" says Sieberer. As an opposition party, the Greens have often introduced motions deemed too extreme by the governing parties. Among them are multiple requests for Germany to take in more refugees and asylum-seekers, including a motion \u00a0from March 2020 to admit some 5,000 people from overcrowded Greek camps. Baerbock and her party vote for more immigration and a more open refugee policy in almost all cases. By contrast, the SPD's Scholz and the CDU's Laschet have a relatively thin voting record on the topic. Publicly, the SPD politician spoke out in favor of accepting more refugees from Moria after fires destroyed the Greek camp in 2020. When large numbers of refugees arrived in Germany during 2015 and 2016, he pleaded for more European cooperation and faster processing procedures for asylum applications, but also advocated for stricter controls at the EU borders and more stringent deportation procedures. For Laschet, only two roll-call votes on the topic are recorded, both on opposition motions in state parliament. Generally, the CDU politician and former integration minister for North Rhine-Westphalia is seen as a\u00a0 staunch supporter of a multicultural society , and, in 2015, he backed Merkel's open refugee policy in the face of criticism. As Merkel's policy got stricter, though, so did his. German soldiers are currently deployed on a total of 11\u00a0missions around the world. These are generally decided on by the government, but most must be approved by parliament. The Greens voted against the army mission \"Resolute Support\" in Afghanistan, which ended in 2021. The Greens, as part of the opposition, have supported only some of these missions. For example, Baerbock has always voted along party lines against German military involvement in NATO's Sea Guardian operation, which is meant to ensure security in the Mediterranean, and against the missions in Iraq and Syria. Other missions have the support of the Greens, however, such as those in North Africa and Lebanon. Environmental policy is the key issue for the Greens. During Baerbock's time in the Bundestag, the Greens have repeatedly introduced motions on the topic, such as a fundamental ban on fracking , as well as an exit from coal by 2022 . Many of these motions have little chance of success and serve primarily to position themselves politically, Sieberer explains. But the Greens also generally support government motions that strengthen climate policy and nature conservation, except for protest votes on motions they deem insufficient. Repeatedly rejecting opposition motions drags down Merkel's own track record on climate policy. Still, Merkel and her ruling coalition support more than half of all motions for more climate and nature protection. Her government has helped introduce and implement some environmental policy decisions in recent years, such as the\u00a0 climate protection program 2030 and an increase in aviation tax rates . But she and her party also voted, for example, to cut solar power subsidies . Once again, there is less data on Laschet and Scholz, who more often vote on regional issues in state parliament. In his few roll-call votes on environmental issues, Laschet has voted against motions on animal welfare and\u00a0 environmental protection . In public, Laschet is often hesitant in his support of climate policies. In his home state, coal still plays a major role . This may be one reason the CDU candidate always emphasizes the importance of industry and economy when talking about climate protection. Motions on EU cooperation are usually introduced by the governing coalition and therefore mostly pass. On this issue, the Greens introduce fewer motions themselves, but support the CDU/CSU and their coalition partners in motions ranging from financial aid for Greece to the start of EU accession talks with Albania in 2019 to participation in the EU's pandemic crisis support in 2020. Being in the opposition, the Greens have agreed with the governing coalition surprisingly often in the past years, Sieberer notes: \"It seems a bit like they're preparing for possible future government participation. You can't disagree with everything if you want to govern together with the same people later.\" \u00a0 Olaf\u00a0Scholz\u00a0is the Social Democrats' candidate as German chancellor to succeed Angela Merkel. There is no doubting his experience \u2014 and he is known for his ability to handle a crisis.\u00a0But many say something is missing.\n\u00a0 Annalena Baerbock is said to be tough, talented and very ambitious. Now, Germany's Green Party has named her as its candidate for chancellor. Is she cut out for the job?\n\u00a0 The state premier of Germany's most populous state is leading the conservative challenge in the general election this year.

{"id": null, "body": "     Antonio Guterres has taken the world's major economies to task for not \"pulling their weight\" to reduce emissions. Ahead of the COP25 climate summit, the UN head said we were rapidly approaching the \"point of no return.\" \"We are confronted with a global climate crisis and the point of no return is no longer over the horizon, it is in sight and hurtling towards us,\" said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on\u00a0the eve of the two-week COP25 global climate summit in Madrid . \"Our war against nature must stop, and we know that it is possible,\" he said Sunday. \"We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions.\" Across the globe, catastrophic weather patterns \u2014 from floods to fire to extreme droughts and heavy snowstorms \u2014\u00a0are wreaking havoc on both human and animal life.\u00a0Scientists are warning that the world is\u00a0running out of time to reverse the worst possible\u00a0effects of man-made climate breakdown. Guterres took member nations to task for not sticking to the\u00a02015 Paris climate agreement, which calls on a limit to fossil fuel use in an attempt to curb global temperatures increases. 'World's largest emitters are not pulling their weight' \"We also see clearly that the world's largest emitters are not pulling their weight,\" he said, \"and without them, our goal is unreachable.\" The world's largest carbon emitter is China and the second-largest, the United States. At last year's UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, member states drew up a framework for monitoring emission reductions and made\u00a0plans for further cuts in the future. However, there has\u00a0still been no agreement on key elements like putting a price on CO2 emissions that could allow carbon taxes to be traded between countries. On Friday,\u00a0 mass rallies were held around the world \u00a0as people called on their governments to address climate change before it's too late. The summer of 2019 saw heat records in Europe broken across the continent. In July, Germany recorded its highest temperature ever at 42.6 C (108 F). France broke its heat record twice in 2019, the highest temperature measuring 46.C (114.8 F) in July. Climate change increases the frequency of heat waves. In November 2019, the Italian archipelago city of Venice experienced multiple flooding events and the high water mark of 1.5 meters was reached three times in one week for the first time in recorded history. Projected sea level rise due to climate change could make these events more likely in the future. The same heat wave that brought record temperatures to France sparked the worst wildfires to hit Spain in 20 years. On the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, wildfires in August decimated a national park on the popular tourist island. Hotter temperatures and drier air due to climate change increase the risk of fires. A combination of drought, storms and extreme heat is depleting Germany's forests. According to BDF, a forest advocacy group, in Germany, more than 1 million established trees have died since 2018. \"These are no longer single unusual weather events. That is climate change,\" said a BDF representative. A glacier on the Italian side of Mont Blanc experienced accelerated melting in 2019. And enthusiasts held a \"funeral\" for the Pizol glacier in the Swiss Alps, which has almost completely disappeared. Scientists say climate change accelerates glacial melting in the Alps. Two consecutive years of drought in Germany have hit farmers hard. In 2018, record drought caused major crop failures, and heat waves in 2019 also damaged crops. \"Climate change means more frequent droughts and extreme weather events in Germany,\"said German Weather Service Vice President Paul Becker. New EU Commission plans 'Green Deal' The newly minted leadership of the European Commission, under former German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, has set lofty climate goals for itself under a policy initiative called\u00a0 the \"European Green Deal.\" Among\u00a0the\u00a0goals set out by the campaign is the plan to make Europe the \"first carbon-neutral continent.\" As von der Leyen and her cabinet took office on Sunday, she hailed the COP25 summit as the perfect \"starting point\" for her climate policy plans. \"Europe is leading in this topic and we know that we have to be ambitious for our planet,''\u00a0von der Leyen told reporters.

{"id": null, "body": "     Many countries like to portray themselves as greener than they actually are. Others turn out to be unexpected climate champions. The Climate Change Performance Index reveals the truth about emissions and energy policies. Many countries are presenting their successes on combating climate change at the COP23 climate conference \u2014 \u00a0but\u00a0does it make them greener? The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) released\u00a0on Wednesday ranks 56 countries and\u00a0the European Union according to their greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy development, energy use and climate policy. The report is published by German environment non-profit Germanwatch and the Climate Action Network. Sweden, Lithuania and Morocco got the best marks, while South Korea, Iran and Saudi Arabia did worst. Just like last year, Germany was ranked relatively low, in position 22,\u00a0mainly due to its heavy use of coal. The EU came in a place higher, at\u00a021.  The good news is that average\u00a0CO2 emissions growth rates have fallen compared to last year's CCPI. The bad news: like last year, no country did well enough on\u00a0energy policy to deserve a \"very good\" ranking.\u00a0 Despite Sweden leading the list thanks to a drop in its emissions and a high share of renewables in its energy mix, it still lacks ambition, according to the report's authors. The Scandinavian country's targets on renewable energy for 2030 are not sufficient to keep global warming below 2 degrees. Morocco , on the other hand, is a\u00a0country\u00a0on the upswing. The African nation has strongly promoted a transition towards renewable energy, which it is now implementing.\u00a0It's expected to rank even higher in the coming years. \u00a0 British success story The first legislation in the world to write emissions reductions into law was signed in the United Kingdom in 2008. This helped the country move forward, since at least in this respect, energy policy is not dependent on the whims of whoever resides\u00a0in Downing Street, Nick Bridge, special representative for climate change with the UK government told DW. \"We have reduced our carbon emissions by 40 percent since 1990, while the economy has grown nearly 70 percent,\"\u00a0Bridge said.\u00a0 Carbon pricing , together with several regulations , has\u00a0been one of the main drivers of success in the country. \"We went from 40 percent of coal in our power generation five years ago, to nearly nothing,\"\u00a0Bridge said. In fact, the UK managed to have a zero-emissions\u00a0day earlier this year. But achieving 8th place in the climate index has also been possible due to offshore wind \u2014 the UK is the biggest offshore wind producer in the world \u2014 and a shift toward\u00a0a\u00a0 circular economy. \"Yet, the country's 2030 targets for emissions and renewable energy are not ambi\u00adtious enough for a well-below-2\u00b0C pathway,\"\u00a0the report reads. Germany must ditch coal Germany is showing off its inventory of clean technologies as the co-host country for the COP23 climate conference. But the country remains one of the world's top ten emitters of greenhouse gas emissions and might therefore miss\u00a0 its climate targets. Germany has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 \u2014 but the measures adopted so far\u00a0will\u00a0only allow a reduction of about 30 percent by then. A huge\u00a0 lignite industry and the transport sector are Germany's biggest burden. \"Coal has no future. The world is moving away from it; Germany has to follow suit,\"\u00a0Eberhard Brandes from WWF Germany told DW. \"Otherwise we will neither be a role model nor adhere to our international commitments.\" Renewables still a dream The CCPI authors put Russia toward the bottom of their climate rankings because of the country's high emissions rate and low use of\u00a0renewables\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the country has the largest natural gas reserves and some of the largest coal and oil reserves in the world. Kulapin (left, at COP23) insists Russia is a green country Alexey Kulapin, director of Russia's energy policy department, however, claimed in a press conference at COP23 that the Russian energy system is one of the greenest in the world. \"Natural gas accounts for more than half of the energy sources in Russia \u2014 and everyone knows that gas is one of the most ecological\u00a0energy sources,\"\u00a0he said. Experts insist Russia lacks ambition on domestic climate policy and has a long way to go to improve its ranking. South Korea ranks third from the bottom. The country's level of renewables in the energy supply is still extremely low. \"We have to increase our renewable energies, but very wisely,\"\u00a0Yoo\u00a0Young-sook, head of the non-profit environmental organization The\u00a0Climate\u00a0Change\u00a0Center and former\u00a0environment\u00a0minister, told DW. She fears a drastic shift away from nuclear power might only increase emissions from\u00a0fossil fuels. Renewables, Yoo\u00a0says, are still a thing of the future in her country. One day before COP23, thousands of anti-coal mining activists gathered to urge a complete phase out of coal for use in power stations. The protesters, dressed with in protective white suits, walked for about 10 kilometers \u2014 from a nearby village to the Hambach coal mine. Hambach is the largest CO2 emitter in Europe. Its expansion has already partially cleared out a 1,000-year-old forest and left several ghost villages behind \u2014 with more to come. Activists believe the climate talks going on in Bonn, only 50 kilometers away, are a complete nonsense while the mine keeps running. Despite a heavy police presence, the mood for Sunday's protest was very peaceful. The protagonists waved colourful banners and wore painted faces. Some brought guitars and played music - at least during the first part of the day. As protesters approached the mine, police officers moved in and began blocking the march. With loud speakers, they warned the demostrators that they were trepassing on private property and they posed a risk to security. As the drew closer to the mine, the long line of demonstrators suddenly burst into life, with many people running and shouting, forgetting the many kilometers they had already walked. Activists said that blocking this type of coal infrastructure was the best way to make their voices heard for an immediate transition away from coal. And yes, at least for a while, the giant digger stopped operating. The hundreds of activists who made it to the coal mine hailed the stoppage as a great success. Anti-coal activists say no other place in Europe represents the dependence on coal for electricity as well as the Hambach mine. Among the many signs carried by protesters, one of the often repeated ones was: Exit coal, protect the climate. Towards the end of Sunday's march, two more groups who had gotten separated from the main demonstration, joined up with their comrades. Here you can see the police have lined up to prevent their advance. The activists were successful in shutting down parts of the Hambach mine for just a day. But whether politicians will take any long-term measures regarding coal mining during the COP23 climate conference remains to be seen.

{"id": null, "body": "     As researchers predict substantial changes to the environment because of global warming, scientists discuss how to get information about the scope of climate change into the hands of decision makers. Climate change is already happening and humans need to adapt, experts said A five-day conference in Geneva aims to provide politicians and other decision makers with the data they need to make informed decisions when it comes to climate change, according to members of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the technical and scientific arm of the United Nations, which is hosting the conference. \"Even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the climate will continue to change,\" Gro Harlem Brundtland, the United Nations secretary-general's special envoy on climate change, said on Monday. \"All countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate.\" But the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms, rising sea levels, droughts, and famine, but how the information is used, according to WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. \"The problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly,\" Jarraud told reporters. \"It's time to link technology and science with decision makers.\" Climate justice Annan said rich countries should make the biggest emissions cuts The conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in Copenhagen in December in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the Kyoto Protocol, the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases, runs out in 2012. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan told delegates in Geneva that climate agreements had to be \"radical, universal and binding\" and have \"climate justice at its heart.\" Annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution. \"The most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic (emissions) cuts,\" the former UN head said, while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues. Better data for the future Politicians need good data as the basis of their decisions, Jarraud said Climate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations, Jarraud added. \"Even if Copenhagen is successful on greenhouse gases, a certain warming (of the planet) will occur,\" he said, adding that improved knowledge of the climate could help manage water and food needs, in addition to preserving the environment. Jarraud gave the examples of malaria and cholera, two potentially fatal diseases that spread in certain climate conditions. Better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur. \"We need to anticipate change, we can no longer base ourselves on the past to take decisions for the future,\" he told journalists. The information can also help reduce costs and benefit sectors of the economy, such as tourism. \"Climate change is here now and countries need tools to adapt to the changing climate,\" the WMO wrote in its invitation to the World Climate Conference. The meeting of representatives from some 80 nations is the third World Climate Conference. The first took place in 1979 and the second in 1990. Those meetings are credited with leading to the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. sms/dpa/AFP Editor: Kate Bowen High-level policymakers, experts and business leaders are gathering in Geneva next week for World Climate Conference-3.

Member states also pledged to donate at least 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to poorer countries in 2021. The summit took place with strict hygiene regulations in place EU leaders turned\u00a0their attention to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the urgent problem of climate change on the second day of a special meeting of the European Council on Tuesday. This came\u00a0after they agreed on Monday to impose new sanctions on Belarus after Minsk forced a Ryanair passenger jet to land in order to arrest an activist journalist on board. Although developments connected to Belarus loomed large\u00a0at the leaders' talks on day two as well, one main\u00a0topic officially slated for discussion was\u00a0the EU's response to COVID-19. Among other things, the leaders\u00a0agreed to donate at least 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to poorer nations by the end of the year. This comes as supplies of vaccine rise\u00a0across the bloc. They also called \"for work to be stepped up to ensure global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines\" and reiterated their support for the UN-backed COVAX program, which\u00a0aims to facilitate the access of\u00a0low-and middle-income countries to COVID-19 vaccines. The leaders also welcomed the introduction of a digital COVID-19 pass that they would like to see launched on July 1. The Digital Covid Certificate will be issued to citizens and residents of the EU\u00a0who have either been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or have recovered from the disease. \"If we continue like this, we have confidence that we will be able to safely reopen our societies,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, adding the EU was on track to meet its goal of fully inoculating 70%\u00a0of adults by late July. The EU hopes that the pass will facilitate tourism in the bloc, an industry that has suffered heavily under the restrictions imposed to stem the spread of the coronavirus. \"Progressively, we should return to the ability to move freely throughout the European Union,\" European Council President Charles Michel said. The leaders also discussed\u00a0the EU's efforts to combat climate change. The bloc is aiming to reduce emissions 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. In a statement after the meeting, the 27 leaders urged the European Commission to unveil its new guidelines for reaching the binding EU targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The commission is due to publish its policy proposals in July. The measures will include stricter carbon dioxide standards for cars, more ambitious renewable energy targets, taxes on polluting fuels, and reform of the EU carbon market \u2014 including plans to introduce emissions trading for road transport and heating from buildings. The measures will need to be approved by\u00a0EU member states and the European Parliament before they are formally adopted. The EU plans to be climate-neutral by 2050 Monday's debate was dominated by events in Belarus surrounding the forced landing of a Ryanair plane and the arrest of Raman Pratasevich, a government-critical journalist. \u00a0 EU leaders called for further targeted economic sanctions on Belarus and urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying through Belarusian airspace. They also called for the immediate release of Pratasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, a law student. The leaders also discussed EU-Russian relations in face of actions by Moscow that they termed \"illegal, provocative and disruptive.\" Such actions include Russian support for an insurgency in eastern Ukraine, and the poisoning and subsequent\u00a0 imprisonment of leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny. At the meeting, leaders also condemned the arrest of Mali's interim\u00a0President Bah N'Daw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane \u00a0and said the EU would consider sanctions against those obstructing the Malian transition. \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "EU summit: COVID, climate change top second-day agenda", "article_name": "eu-summit-covid-climate-change-top-second-day-agenda", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/eu-summit-covid-climate-change-top-second-day-agenda/a-57650384", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 3984, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:01:55.928376"}

Concern over a UN report on global warming released on Monday\u00a0led EU environment ministers to meet in Luxembourg, where they talked for more than 13 hours in search for a compromise.\u00a0 The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report\u00a0 warned that the world was running out of time to avoid a \"climate catastrophe\" and that it will need to take \"unprecedented\"\u00a0steps to avoid a dangerous rise in temperature.

{"id": null, "body": "     Floods, drought and mass migration: all factors why Germany has made the UN's response to climate change its priority at the Security Council. But political roadblocks at home and abroad could complicate action. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas led\u00a0a mantra among delegations from nations large and small at Tuesday's Berlin Climate and Security Conference: Time's up in ignoring the security threats presented by climate change. \"Climate change acts as a catalyst: It makes conflicts more likely,\" he said. \"We don't have any time to waste.\" Sharpening the UN's response to climate change is a top priority for Germany during its two-year stint as a nonpermanent member of the Security Council , which began this year. Despite the urgency for action, political roadblocks both at home and abroad will make implementation difficult. Baron Waqa (L), president of Nauru, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (M) und John Kerry, former US secretary of state, all gave remarks at the conference German call to action The forum, hosted by Germany's Foreign Ministry, brought together political, scientific and business leaders from more than 25 nations.\u00a0Maas used the event to present a three-point \"Berlin Call for Action,\" which outlines goals for the UN to \"be as proactive as possible\" in stemming conflicts associated with climate change. According to the plan, the UN should better monitor island and equatorial nations most susceptible to food shortages and national disaster,\u00a0reporting regularly on the situations to improve communication and response time. It should also pilot programs that weave climate action into every facet of foreign policy. Read more :\u00a0 As Kenya's herding communities struggle to adapt to drought, new land management deals could help Germany is poised to lead the charge on such initiatives due to the government's ambitious climate program, Maas added. In 2018, 40% of Germany's energy mix was powered by renewables . Meanwhile, legislation to divorce Germany from coal-powered energy and set sector-specific emissions targets in tricky areas like transportation and housing are slated for adoption this year. Germany also made climate change a main priority during its 2011-2012 Security Council elected membership. The focus had few substantive outcomes, but it did help push environmental security threats such as desertification in North Africa and migration issues into Security Council discussions, analysts note . Though times for truth But the political environment surrounding climate change is more complex now than it was ten years ago, former US Secretary of State John Kerry noted in his keynote speech at the conference.\u00a0 \"Facts are under assault, truth is mobbed,\" he said. He added\u00a0that both science and the multilateral diplomacy needed to address the security risks of climate change are under attack. \"That is not how you make any nation great, and that's not how you protect people in the world.\" The remarks evoked rhetoric commonly used by US President Donald Trump, who recently withdrew the US from the 2016 Paris climate agreement. \u00a0Originally signed by 194\u00a0nations and the EU, with Kerry\u00a0as\u00a0the US representative, the agreement seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees\u00a0Celsius above pre-industrial levels. President Trump also recently barred the federal agency that reports on the impact of climate change from presenting projections past the year 2040, which is before scientists expect the most disastrous effects of climate change to hit Western nations. US President Donald Trump has pushed for the continued use of fossil fuels and questioned scientific evidence surrounding climate change German auto woes The US may be an extreme case as of late, but its developments to stymie climate change action\u00a0are no isolated incident, Kerry noted: \"No country in the world, despite the best intentions of most, is getting the job done.\" Once seen as an environmental leader, Germany has been criticized in recent years by its European partners for losing momentum on fighting climate change. Read more :\u00a0 German issues in a nutshell: 'Energiewende' In a country where roughly 800,000 jobs depend on the automobile industry, political leaders have taken little action against auto manufacturers such as\u00a0 Volkswagen for their role in the 2015 \"Dieselgate\" emissions scandal or towards\u00a0changing\u00a0Germany's dependency on combustion engine transport. Meanwhile, emissions in the transportation and housing sectors have barely budged since 1990. Studies show that Germany could miss its emissions reduction goals for 2020 by at least 8%. And new environmental legislation lauded by Foreign Minister Maas in his opening remarks has been dragged down by intergovernmental bickering over possible effects on the economy. \"Everything moves faster in the digital age, except for government,\" Kerry commented. Getting the message Reluctant Western governments will soon get the message about the urgent need for climate action, Shirley Botchway, Ghana's minister of foreign affairs, said at the conference, pointing to the relationship between climate change and migration. \"Our countries are agricultural, and if we do not have high yields anymore because farming is destroyed, people will move from rural to urban areas. And when they don't find work, they move on perilous journeys ... crossing into Europe and the Americas,\" she said. \"Then it's not just Ghana's problem.\" Global mass migration, ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, as well as instability in\u00a0Europe due to the United Kingdom's impending departure from the European Union, have all dominated recent discussions on the Security Council. Given its already prominent role in global affairs, Germany's return to the council as a non-permanent member gives it an opportunity to act as a balancing force in such discussions. Permanent members of the council are often divided between France, the US and the UK on one side, and China and Russia on the other. Germany\u00a0could leverage its position to push a climate agenda based on stability that could breathe life into stalled climate policies, both at home and abroad.\u00a0 New impetus in such policies can't come soon enough, Kerry noted.\u00a0 \"If Europe thinks that the migration that came from Turkey and from Syria was a political game changer, wait until you see the migration from half of Northern Africa and the Middle East that has no ability to grow food, have water and be able to live decently,\" he said. \"They'll be pounding at the door because leaders today were unwilling to do what they know they have to do.\" The special committee met in Berlin to discuss future climate action after the issue featured prominently in Sunday's EU elections. But critics say the government is dragging its feet on an urgent topic.

{"id": null, "body": "     Heads of state gathering for the climate conference in Glasgow will argue over plans to burn fewer fossil fuels, the only way to honor their pledges to protect the planet. Before a two-week United Nations climate conference started on Sunday, leaders from around the world had failed to set policies that would keep global warming \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius \u2014 in continuing defiance of promises they made at a summit in Paris six years ago. \"The time has passed for diplomatic niceties,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0in a tweet ahead of a meeting of the G-20 group of big economies at the weekend.\u00a0\"If all governments \u2014 especially G-20 governments \u2014 do not stand up and lead efforts against the climate crisis, we are headed for terrible human suffering.\" In recent years, amid increasingly violent weather extremes and mass protests, climate change\u00a0has been thrust into the political spotlight. But while the core science has been clear for half a century \u2014 burning fossil fuels releases gases that act like a greenhouse around the Earth, trapping heat and warping the climate \u2014 politicians have sidelined the problem. Now, after two and a half\u00a0decades of yearly negotiations, tens of thousands of people are descending on the Scottish city of Glasgow \u00a0to thrash out agreements on emissions at the 26th Conference of the Parties, or COP26 . It has been hailed as a \"last best chance\" to stop the planet from warming 1.5 C above pre-industrial temperatures . Low-lying islands are particularly at risk of rising sea levels resulting from warming temperatures \"When things start to go wrong, they can go wrong at extraordinary speed,\" said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ahead of the weekend G20 summit , drawing a parallel between climate change and the fall of the Roman Empire. \"Unless we get this right in tackling climate change, we could see our civilization, our world, also go backward.\" Britain's Prince Charles told G20 leaders in Rome on Sunday that they have an \"overwhelming responsibility to generations yet unborn.\"\u00a0 \"It is impossible not to hear the despairing voices of young people who see you as the stewards of the planet, holding the viability of the future in your hands,\" Charles said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UN climate summits \u00a0are a forum for world leaders to agree on plans to burn fewer fossil fuels. Beyond the technical negotiations, like agreeing on rules about how countries should report cuts to pollution or finalizing previous agreements, delegates will haggle over two core issues: emissions and money. The UK government, which is hosting the event, is pushing leaders to promise to cut their carbon pollution sooner and faster. It has put \"coal, cars, cash, and trees\" at the top of the agenda. The cash part of that slogan is particularly tricky. Rich countries have failed to deliver on a promise made at a previous climate summit to pay poorer ones $100 billion a year \u00a0(\u20ac86.5 billion) in climate finance by 2020 \u2014 an amount that covers neither the costs of adapting to changes nor greening economies. Delegates from poor and vulnerable countries, some of whom\u00a0are reportedly unable to attend the summit because of coronavirus restrictions and the cost of travel, are also calling for rich polluters to pay for losses and damages from climate change-fueled weather extremes they have done little to cause. This is not included in the $100 billion-a-year pledge, which is only for cutting emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change. But scientists, activists\u00a0and delegates from countries on the front line of climate change are skeptical of the idea that climate summits can fix the problem. They have criticized rich countries for not honoring their pledges . They have also dismissed promises to cut long-term emissions that are not backed up by policies today. \"This is all we hear from our so-called leaders \u2014 words that sound great but so far have not led to action,\" said climate activist\u00a0 Greta Thunberg at a pre-COP event in Italy last month. \"Our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises.\" New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Sunday announced an ambitious new emissions reduction target, pledging to halve the country's net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The new target is substantially higher than its previous goal of a 30%\u00a0cut that was set as part of the 2015 Paris agreement. New Zealand's enhanced contribution to the global fight on climate change \"represents our fair share, and is in line with what's needed if we are to avoid the worst impacts of global warming,\" said Ardern. James Shaw, her minister for climate change,\u00a0described the next decade as a \"make or break\" for the planet. \"To stand a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C, the science shows we now have about eight years left to almost halve global greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said in a statement. \"That's eight years for countries to make the necessary plans, put in place policies, implement them, and ultimately deliver the cuts.\" Carbon dioxide has continued to clog up the atmosphere despite decades of international treaties. The concentration of the planet-warming pollutant has risen to 413 parts per million (ppm). It was just 375 ppm when Thunberg was born in 2003. Like most student strikers, she has never known what scientists broadly consider a safe level. The world crossed that threshold \u2014350ppm \u2014 in 1988. While those numbers sound abstract, they translate into deadly weather extremes. Today, with global temperatures already 1.1 C hotter than before the Industrial Revolution, the climate has grown more chaotic than it has been for the rest of human history. The heat wave that scorched North\u00a0America this summer was made 150 times more likely and 2 C hotter because of climate change, according to a study from climate scientists at the World Weather Attribution research group. The same group of scientists found a similar but weaker connection for the rains that triggered deadly floods across northern Europe in July . The US was just one of numerous countries that had to battle extreme fires this summer Still, without efforts to shift policy in recent years, scientists have said the planet could be facing even deadlier levels of warming. Before the Paris Agreement, the world was headed to heat about 4 C. Now policies put it on track for about 3 C. If pledges are met, temperatures by the end of the century could end up between 2 C and 2.5 C. Such a temperature rise is well above the promised goal during the Paris Agreement of \"well below\" 2 C and ideally 1.5 C. That would be an effective death sentence for low-lying island nations, as well as vulnerable communities battling weather extremes across the world. That level of warming would be \"catastrophic,\" said Amos Wemanya, an energy analyst at Kenya-based think tank Power Shift Africa. \"Rich countries need to be more ambitious than they are right now if we are to achieve the 1.5 C target.\" This is an updated version of a previous article. A wildfire that burned through at least 7,780 hectares (30 square miles) in about a week and devastated forests in southern Spain was brought under control thanks to steady rains. The downpour helped the firefighters, who were backed by some 50 aircrafts. The blaze was one of the most difficult to combat in recent times in Spain. Some 2,600 people were forced to flee their homes. Unprecedented flooding \u2014 caused by two months' worth of rainfall in two days \u2014 has resulted in devastating damage in central Europe, leaving at least 226 people dead in Germany and Belgium. Narrow valley streams swelled into raging floods in the space of hours, wiping out centuries-old communities. Rebuilding the ruined homes, businesses and infrastructure is expected to cost billions of euros. While half of Europe is drowning, elsewhere areas are going up in flames: Large fires raged, particularly in Greece, Italy and Turkey. They have caused unforeseeable monetary damage, while thousands of people in Europe have lost their homes and their belongings. In addition to deadly wildfires, Italy also battled record heat temperatures, with the Italian Health Ministry issuing the maximum possible heat warning level for many cities. On the island of Sicily, 48.8 degrees Celsius (almost 120 degrees Fahrenheit) was measured on August 11 \u2014 a new European heat record. The heat could make existing fires worse, or lead to new ones. Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire continues smoldering in California. It's California's largest fire on record, and among the most destructive in the state's history \u2014 it wiped the town of Greenville off the map. Although it's about 60% contained, the fire continues to burn two months in. Meanwhile, hot and dry conditions continue in the region, spreading fears of more fire. Earlier this summer, record floods also hit parts of India and central China, overwhelming dams and drains and flooding streets. The downpours have been particularly heavy, even for the rainy season. Scientists have predicted that climate change will lead to more frequent and intense rainfall \u2014 warmer air holds more water, creating more rain. As nations flood in northern Europe, Mediterranean countries like Greece were in the grip of several heat waves. In the first week of July, temperatures soared to 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit). Tourism hot spots like the Acropolis were forced to shut during the day, while the extreme heat also sparked forest fires outside Thessaloniki, which helicopters tried to douse. \"It is an unprecedented reality in Sardinia\u2019s history,\" said Sardinia's Governor Christian Salinas of the ongoing wildfires that have scorched the historic central western area of Montiferru. \"So far, 20,000 hectares of forest that represent centuries of environmental history of our island have gone up in ashes.\" Around 1,500 people were evacuated from the island by the end of July. Intense heat is becoming more common, as seen in late June in the US states of Washington and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Scorching temperatures under a \"heat dome,\" hot air trapped for days by high pressure fronts, caused hundreds of heat-related deaths. The village of Lytton recorded a high of 49.6 Celsius (121 Fahrenheit) \u2014 and burned to the ground the next day. Heat and drought are fueling one of the most intense wildfire seasons in the West Coast and Pacific Northwest regions. Oregon's Bootleg Fire, which burned an area the size of Los Angeles in just two weeks, was so big it created its own weather and sent smoke all the way to New York City. A recent study said the weather conditions would have been \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. To the south, central Brazil is suffering its worst drought 100 years, increasing the risk of fires and further deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Researchers recently reported that a large swath of the southeastern Amazon has flipped from absorbing to emitting planet-warming CO2 emissions, pushing the rainforest closer to a \"tipping point.\" After years of unrelenting drought, more than 1.14 million people in Madagascar are food-insecure, with some now forced to eat raw cactus, wild leaves and roots, and locusts in famine-like conditions. With the absence of natural disaster, crop failure or political conflict, the dire situation in the African nation is said to be first famine in modern history caused solely by climate change. The number of people fleeing conflict and natural disasters hit a 10-year high in 2020, with a record 55 million people relocating within their own country. That's in addition to some 26 million people who fled across borders. A joint report released by refugee monitors in May found that three-quarters of the internally displaced were victims of extreme weather \u2014 and that number is likely to grow.

{"id": null, "body": "     German farmers are facing the third consecutive year of crop loss due to insufficient rainfall. How can the agriculture industry across Europe adapt to our changing climate? With hotter summers, severe storms and prolonged dry spells in the forecast, the outlook for Europe's farmers is daunting. Average annual temperatures are expected to increase anywhere from 1 to 5.5 degrees Celsius (1.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit), with the strongest warming projected across the south of the continent in the summer months. A September 2019 report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) noted that heat stress, extreme weather events like flash floods and hailstorms, and\u00a0water shortages have already changed growing conditions for several crops in Europe \u2014 especially for Mediterranean staples like olives and wine grapes. Places in northern Europe, meanwhile, could see agricultural benefits from climate change, including longer growing seasons and a shorter frost period \"allowing the cultivation of new crops and varieties,\" said the report. Suitable cropland around the Baltic Sea could more than double by 2100, from 32% of land area today to about 76%, with certain crops now common to southern Europe taking root further north. Read more: \u00a0 Amid 'climate emergency,' EU pins hopes on Green Deal UK, Scandinavian wines Those climatic changes have already borne fruit \u2014 quite literally. In the northern German state of Lower Saxony, where average temperatures have risen nearly 2 degrees Celsius in the last several decades, some farmers have started cultivating fruits typically found further south, such as apricots and nectarines. And wine cultivation, typically associated with more southern slopes in France, Spain and Italy, is now taking off in places like Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Ryedale Vineyards , in northeastern England, has been producing British wines since 2006. As one of the UK's northernmost wineries, it relies mainly on hybrid disease-resistant grape varieties more suited to northern Europe's cooler regions. The warming trend of the past decades has seen the UK's wine industry\u00a0quadruple\u00a0in size since 2000, with English vineyards producing some 13.2 million bottles in 2018. But the changing climate does pose other challenges, including unusual weather patterns and increased risk of disease associated with wetter summers.\u00a0which have been linked to climate change. \"Unpredictable weather events, droughts and intense summer storms are a real problem and seem to have increased in frequency,\" said Jon Fletcher, who runs Ryedale Vineyards with his family. In an email to DW, he listed off the challenges: late frosts, destructive hailstorms and dry spells that can last for months. \"This year we have already had the sunniest May on record and no rainfall for two months, so the unpredictable weather continues.\" Read more:\u00a0 Climate change pushing wine regions farther north \"Climate change is posing a risk for the sustainability of vineyard management at global scale and, particularly, in Europe,\" said Josep Maria Sole of VISCA (Vineyards Integrated Smart Climate Application) , an EU-funded project that aims to help Europe's wine industry develop medium- and long-term adaption strategies. He said wine producing areas will increasingly suffer from intense heat waves and droughts and, in certain regions in Spain, more intense spring frosts, which can damage grapevine buds. Blaz Kurnik, an expert on climate change impacts and adaptation at the EEA, said these higher temperatures, especially warmer winters, will also favor the introduction of new diseases and pests, including the olive fruit fly. Increasing swarms are threatening Europe's olive oil industry, responsible for around three-quarters of the world's supply. \"In the worst-case scenario, up to 80% of [Italy's] olive trees will be affected by this every year,\" said Kurnik, adding that flies were also infesting Spain's olive groves. Lychee, papaya: Are these Europe's future crops? Mango, avocado and lychee: Europe's future cash crops? Italy, which ranks second in the world for olive oil production, saw a disastrous harvest in 2018. Bad weather and frost caused production to drop by 57%, representing a loss of nearly \u20ac1 billion ($1.13 billion). Sicily is one of Italy's top olive oil-producing regions, along with Calabria and Puglia. But some farmers there have begun focusing their attention on crops native to tropical regions, including mangoes, avocado and lychee fruit.\u00a0 Tropical crops were first introduced to Sicily back in the 1970s, but recent years have seen an exponential growth of these crops and the introduction of new species such as papaya, replacing citrus fruits which \"are no longer remunerative,\" said Vittorio Farina, an associate professor in agriculture at the University of Palermo. Read more: \u00a0 Will it soon be too late to save the climate? \"The favorable climate of many areas in the Mediterranean basin is promoting tropical fruit cultivations,\" he said in an email to DW. \"In fact, the predominant mango and avocado production is concentrated in tropical countries, but recently its cultivation has spread outside the traditional geographical regions to the Mediterranean basin and in particular in Egypt, Israel, South Africa, Europe, mainly Spain and Italy.\" Farina said a succession of milder winters has favored the expansion of mango, avocado and papaya orchards destined for export markets further north, though the corresponding drier summers and extreme weather events remain a challenge. \"The problem of the scarcity of water resources for agriculture will increasingly impose the introduction of species with low water requirements,\" said Farina, suggesting the possible introduction of fruit like the cactus pear. \"For most other tropical species, irrigation in the warm months in the dry areas is an essential condition for obtaining a quality product.\" Farina said they were testing precision irrigation strategies to limit the water footprint of the tropical crops. Finding the right solution Margarita Ruiz-Ramos, an associate professor at the Polytechnic University of Madrid, told DW that new crops were also being tested in Spain, including pistachios. However, she stressed that the priority now was experimenting with different varieties of existing crops that could withstand new growing conditions \u2014 such as types of fruit that don't rely as heavily on winter chill to produce spring blossoms.\u00a0 \"There already is the possibility to adapt the variety without changing the [main] crop in the short to medium term,\" she said, pointing out that some crops could also shift to other more suitable areas within the same country. Read more:\u00a0 Are cities Europe's new biodiversity hotspots? As part of her work at the Research Center for the Management of Agricultural and Environmental Risks , Ruiz-Ramos analyzes crop varieties, planting schedules, soil conditions, irrigation options and many other variables to find the optimum strategy for farmers and \"design locally tailored adaptations.\" The most promising solutions are then tested in the field. \"It's a compromise between different needs. And that's why it's not so obvious as to just bring in some African crops,\" she said. However, she didn't rule out the fact that dramatic temperature changes could one day lead growers to take a chance on non-native crops. Yves Madre, a co-founder of Brussels-based think tank Farm Europe , said the EU's farming sector needs to be more open to new breeding techniques that would introduce drought and disease-tolerance genes to existing crops, which can include genome editing. With more innovation and investment, he said the EU would be able to meet its goals in terms of food security and growth, especially in rural areas. As northern regions warm, winegrowers have moved into places like Denmark and the UK, among them Ryedale Vineyards in England. The EU-funded VISCA app, now being tested in Spain, Italy and Portugal, aims to help vineyards that are starting to feel the effects of a warming climate. Adaption strategies include precise irrigation, drought-resistant grapes and pruning techniques that influence growth. Sorghum, a hot weather grain, has been cultivated in Europe since just after World War II, primarily as animal fodder. But with increasing droughts it has started to see a resurgence in countries like France, Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria. A staple in Africa, sorghum uses 30% less water than corn and can produce grains even in high temperatures. The EU has been promoting the plant since 2017. Europe's olive oil industry, led by Spain, Italy and Greece, produces about three-quarters of global supply. But drought, erratic weather like hail, as well as warm-weather pests and diseases have become detrimental. 2018 was a particularly bad year: Italy's production dropped 57%. Improved irrigation techniques, selective pruning and a gradual northward shift could help olive groves adapt. Some farmers in Spain and Italy have begun cultivating pistachios, drought-resistant nut trees which are suited to arid areas with lots of sun. Today, most of the world's pistachios are grown in Iran and California, but other parts of southern Europe share the same ideal conditions: cold winters, very hot summers and late frosts. Other alternatives for farmers in southern Europe are tropical fruits, including mango, avocado, lychee and papaya. Recent years have seen an exponential growth of such crops in southern Italy. They've begun to edge out citrus fruits, which are no longer the moneymakers they once were. Milder winters have been beneficial, but water shortages in the summer months remain a challenge.

The organization CESTA works to ensure a more sustainable future. El Salvador is the smallest country in Central America and has one of the highest population densities in the region, with more than 300 inhabitants per square kilometer. Alongside Guatemala and Honduras, it also ranks among the poorest countries in the Americas, according to the UN organization UNICEF. More than 40% of children in El Salvador live in poverty.\u00a0 Moreover, the country is suffering badly\u00a0from the consequences of climate change: Drought and forest fires are destroying areas used for food production, while hurricanes and floods cause widespread\u00a0devastation.

{"id": null, "body": "     Wildfires across the world, Arctic ice rapidly melting, seas rising, habitat loss \u2014 2019 bore bad news for the climate. But it was also the year millions of people were galvanized into action. Year on year, the climate news only seems to get worse. Temperature records are broken, and broken again, the extent of polar ice melt exceeds expectations, while efforts to cut emissions lag behind targets. And 2019 was no exception. Yet something else happened this year.\u00a0 Dire warnings by the\u00a0 IPCC \u00a0and other experts, images of blazing forests and news of mass biodiversity loss helped make 2019 a year of climate activism. Greta Thunberg's school strike went global, environmental protests stepped up a gear and people began talking not of climate change but a climate crisis and a climate emergency .\u00a0 These were some of the defining climate events and images that made 2019 the year of climate consciousness.\u00a0 Raging wildfires Fires raged across the world throughout 2019, wiping out biodiversity and releasing the carbon stored in trees and plants. This was the year we saw the Amazon burn like never before and flames sweep the Arctic tundra.\u00a0 Here are some of the most devastating wildfires that occurred in 2019. The world's largest rainforest was ablaze for weeks in 2019, burning at a rate not seen in years. Between January and August, there was an 82% increase in fires in the Brazilian Amazon compared to the same time period last year, and August itself saw more than 30,000 fires reported. Most are thought to have been lit by farmers clearing land for crops and cattle. The Amazon wasn't the only region in Brazil on fire this year. There were even more fires in the Cerrado savannah in the country's south. One of the most biodiverse areas of the world, Cerrado is also one of the most endangered. About half its green areas have already been lost, mostly to soy farming, but the savannah is also very vulnerable to fire. Month-long wildfires in the Indonesian regions of Sumatra and Borneo destroyed more than 40,000 hectares this year. Already-endangered orangutans were killed, those that survived have a vastly reduced habitat. The carbon-rich peat under the forest's roots makes these fires particularly hard to extinguish \u2014 and dangerous for the climate: 700 million tons of CO2 were released into the atmosphere. The world's largest tropical wetlands, the Pantanal, also went up in flames this year. The Pantanal is located mostly in Brazil but extends to Bolivia and Paraguay. The number of fires there broke all records this year, with over 8,000 registered. Some 1.2 million hectares of forest were destroyed in Bolivia alone. Scientists called it the country's biggest disaster ever for biodiversity. Bushfires ravaged the US state of California this year. They were caused by sparks emitted from old infrastructure, fanned by hot and dry winds and accelerated by the dry conditions in the region and quickly turned into an inferno, destroying homes and land, killing three people, forcing tens of thousands to evacuate and leaving almost a million people without power. Even within the Arctic circle, fires were burning this year. In Siberia, hundreds of fires over three months destroyed more than 4 million hectares of forest, creating a cloud of soot and ash as large as the entire EU, and Russian military had to be deployed. Across Alaska, there were 400 wildfires this year. Greenland and Canada didn't escape the blaze either. Australia saw unprecedented bushfires this year that burned at a particularly high intensity. Drought, searing temperatures and dry winds saw more than a million hectares burned, taking the lives of four people and up to 1,000 koalas. Koalas are considered vulnerable to extinction and this year's bushfires put the future of the slow and helpless animals even more in danger.  Author: Anne-Sophie Br\u00e4ndlin Arctic melt speeds up\u00a0 In 2019, the average air temperatures in the Arctic were almost 2 degrees Celsius (3.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal. Temperatures in Greenland reached highs of over 17 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit) in June, causing rapid ice-sheet melting. A photograph of huskies pulling sleds through ankle-deep meltwaters on a Greenland ice sheet powerfully illustrated this. It was taken by a Danish climatologist whose work in Greenland was made difficult and dangerous by the rapidly changing conditions.\u00a0 This year, the summer melt was the second-lowest level ever recorded. The 13 lowest sea ice extents in the satellite record have all occurred in the last 13 years, according to the annual Arctic Report Card \u00a0 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States. And that has global repercussions. The Arctic works as a giant freezer for the planet. Arctic snow and ice reflects the sun's energy back into space, cooling the entire planet. But as the ice retreats, a vicious cycle is set in motion. With\u00a0less snow and ice on the water,\u00a0more heat is absorbed by the ocean, which is further accelerating ice loss. On top of this, the Arctic itself may now be contributing to climate change . The frozen ground of the Arctic, also known as permafrost, contains lots of carbon which is released when it starts to thaw. This carbon then turns into a greenhouse gas, which so far has been absorbed by plant life growing in the summer, but this year it has started escaping into the atmosphere. Thawing Arctic permafrost could be releasing as much carbon as Japan. A hungry polar bear walks on a road in the Russian city of Norilsk hundreds of miles from its natural habitat Meanwhile, Arctic animals \u2014 like the polar bear \u2014 are losing habitat. This year, starving polar bears were snapped scavenging for food in a Russian village hundreds of miles from their natural habitat, making for a startling image of our impact on nature coming home.\u00a0\u00a0 Another polar bear video to go viral this year was of a young, emaciated animal that was washed up in a Russian village on a piece of ice, exhausted by its search for food.\u00a0 Rising seas threaten more cities that anticipated\u00a0 Climate change isn't just threatening wild habitats. New research published this year shows that rising seas could affect three times more people by 2050 than previously thought. Some 150 million people are currently living on land that could be submerged by mid-century. A quarter of the current population of Vietnam, for instance, live on land, such as\u00a0Ho Chi Minh City,\u00a0that will likely be inundated. In Thailand, that figure\u00a0stands at more than 10% of the population. Cities like Mumbai, Shanghai and Bangkok could also be wiped out.\u00a0 Fridays for Future goes global\u00a0 With all this bad news, it's perhaps no surprise that 2019 saw climate change loom larger than ever in public consciousness. And that awareness spurred unprecedented action.\u00a0 On August 20, 2018 a lone teenage activist \u2013 Greta Thunberg \u2013 skipped school to demand the Swedish government act on climate change. A week later she was joined by fellow students, teachers and parents in Sweden. By March 2019, the movement had exploded across the globe, with students in 135 countries demanding their governments take action and forcing adults to confront the deeply uncomfortable image of a generation of children in fear for their future.\u00a0 Fridays for Future students were soon joined by Scientists for Future, Parents for Future and Teachers for Future. On September 20, the largest climate strike yet saw some 4 million people of all ages take to the streets in more than 150 countries. Extinction Rebellion shifts gears on climate activism Alongside Fridays for Future, the big\u00a0name in climate activism this year was Extinction Rebellion.\u00a0 The movement started in the United Kingdom in 2018 but like Fridays for Future, it went global in 2019 and now has groups in some 70 countries around the world. Inspired by grassroots movements like Occupy and the non-violence of Gandhi and Rosa Parks, Extinction Rebellion is going one step further than waving banners and has turned to civil disobedience to drive their message home.\u00a0 They have paralyzed traffic by blocking some of the busiest roads in major cities and unloaded a heap of horse manure in front of the Madrid climate talks. They've colored a local river in Zurich acid green, sprayed the British Treasury with gallons of fake blood and interrupted a Brexit debate with the buttocks of semi-naked protesters facing the chamber of the House of Commons.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What they are most known for, though, is their \"die-ins,\" where hundreds of people swarm public squares to collapse to the ground, symbolizing the deaths humanity faces if politicians don't do something, fast. The year of climate emergency One of Extinction Rebellion's core demands is that governments declare a \"climate emergency.\" Oxford Dictionary chose the phrase as Word of the Year 2019, defining the term as \"a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it.\" In 2018, it was on hardly anyone's radar but in 2019, the words were blazoned across banners by protestors and dropped into speeches by politicians, and in November, 11,000 scientists declared a global \"climate emergency.\" Hundreds of cities around the world , as well as the EU Parliament declared a climate emergency in 2019, admitting that measures taken thus far to prevent a climate disaster aren't enough and promising to make\u00a0climate change policy a priority. Still, declaring a climate emergency isn't legally binding. Some local councils are committing to specific targets \u2014 such as reaching net-zero emissions earlier than their national government plans to \u2014 others are more vague in their promise to make climate change policy a priority and see the move as sending a message to citizens and the rest of the world to inspire change from the bottom up. Climate conference falls short of concrete action And local and grassroots action may be more important than ever, after the disappointing outcome of this year's COP25 climate conference. Governments were expected \u00a0to collectively agree on a deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions more rapidly. Yet the concluding resolution only endorsed the \"urgent need\" to close the gap between existing emissions pledges and the goals set at the 2015 Paris Agreement. Brazil, China, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the United States reportedly led resistance to bolder action.\u00a0\u00a0 France hit record temperatures this summer, and the urban heat island effect means cities are particularly hot. While vegetation releases water into the atmosphere, cooling things down, concrete and asphalt trap heat. During a heat wave, Paris can be 10 degrees hotter than the surrounding countryside. Pollution also builds up in slow-moving summer air \u2014 another reason urban heat waves can kill. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina tore apart one of America's most iconic cultural heartlands. Even though it's rebuilt, New Orleans has been battered again and again by powerful storms. A government report last year said the US southeast was \"exceptionally vulnerable to sea-level rise, extreme heat events, hurricanes and decreased water availability.\" Trump's response? \"I don\u2019t believe it.\" This year India's monsoon was the second driest in 65 years, leaving 44% of the country suffering from drought. In Chennai, things have become desperate: its main reservoir has dried up, residents are queuing for hours at pumps, water is being trucked in and hospitals are under pressure. As the planet heats up, more and more cities could run out of water. Arctic temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. This is taking its toll on cities in Russia's far north, as the permafrost beneath building foundations begins to melt. Cities like Norilsk and Yakutsk are already seeing serious subsidence, and scientists expect their infrastructure to become at least 25% less stable by mid-century. Rising seas threaten coastal cities the world over, but Jakarta, with 13 rivers, suffers more floods than most. Limited access to water means residents pump it from underground aquifers, causing subsidence. By 2050, 95% of North Jakarta could be submerged. Indonesia is building the world's biggest seawall to protect its capital, but that could leave thousands of fishermen without homes or income. Some 28% of the population of Bangladesh lives on the coast, and high tides are rising 10 times faster than the global average. In 2018, natural disasters displaced 78,000 people, with riverbank erosion \u2014 expected to increase as Himalayan ice melts \u2014 moving many more. Already one of the world's most densely populated cities, the capital of Dhaka takes in 1,000 new migrants every day. Author: Ruby Russell Climate change and environmental issues are complicated.

{"id": null, "body": "     If we want to stop the Earth from warming, it's clear that coal, oil and gas must remain in the ground. But experts also say CO2 needs to be removed from the atmosphere. What are the options and how do they work? The world is, on average, 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer today \u00a0than it was in\u00a01850. If this trend continues, our planet will be 2 \u2013 3 degrees hotter by the end of this century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The main reason for this temperature rise is higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which cause\u00a0the atmosphere to trap heat radiating from the Earth into space. Since 1850, the proportion of CO2 in the air has increased from 0.029% to 0.041% (288 ppm to 414 ppm). This is directly related to the burning of coal, oil and gas, which\u00a0were created from forests, plankton and plants over millions of years. Back then, they stored CO2 and kept it out of the atmosphere, but as fossil fuels are burned,\u00a0that\u00a0CO2 is released. Other contributing factors include industrialized agriculture and slash-and-burn land clearing techniques. Over the past 50 years, more than\u00a01200 billion tons of CO2 have been emitted into the planet's atmosphere \u2014 36.6 billion tons in 2018 alone. As a result, the global average temperature has risen by 0.8 degrees in just half a century. Atmospheric CO2 should remain at a minimum In 2015, the world came together to sign the Paris Climate Agreement \u00a0which set the goal of\u00a0limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees \u2014 1.5 degrees, if possible. The agreement limits the amount of CO2 that can be released into the atmosphere. According to the IPCC, if\u00a0a\u00a0maximum of around 300 billion tons were\u00a0emitted, there would be\u00a0a 50% chance of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. If CO2 emissions remain the same , however, the CO2 'budget' would be used up in just seven years. According to the IPCC's report on the 1.5 degree target, negative emissions are also necessary to achieve the climate targets. Using reforestation to remove CO2 One planned measure to stop too much CO2 from being released into the atmosphere is reforestation. According to studies, 3.6 billion tons of CO2 \u2014 around 10% of current CO2 emissions \u2014 could be saved every year during the growth phase. However, a study by researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Zurich, stresses that achieving this would require the use of land areas equivalent in size to the entire US. Reforestation has potential to tackle the climate crisis by capturing CO2. But it would require a large amount of space Restoring mold levels in soil by switching agriculture methods could also help with carbon capture More humus in the soil Humus in the soil stores a lot of carbon .\u00a0But this is being released through the\u00a0industrialization of\u00a0agriculture. The amount of humus in the soil can be increased by\u00a0using catch crops and\u00a0plants with deep roots as well as by working harvest remnants back into the ground and avoiding\u00a0deep plowing. According to a study by the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) on using targeted CO2 extraction as a part of EU climate policy, between two and five billion tons of CO2 could be saved with a global build-up of humus reserves. Biochar shows promise Some scientists see biochar as a promising technology for keeping CO2 out of the atmosphere. Biochar is created when organic material is heated and pressurized in a zero or very low-oxygen environment. In powdered form, the biochar is then spread on arable land where it acts as a fertilizer. This also increases the amount of carbon content in the soil. According to the same study from the SWP, global application of this technology could save between 0.5 and two billion tons of CO2 every year. Storing CO2 in the ground Storing CO2 deep in the Earth is already well-known and practiced on Norway's oil fields, for example. However, the process is still controversial, as storing CO2 underground can lead to earthquakes and leakage in the long-term. A different\u00a0method is currently being practiced in Iceland, in which CO2 is sequestered into porous basalt rock to be mineralized\u00a0into stone. Both methods still require more research, however. Capturing CO2 to be held underground is done by using chemical processes which effectively extract the gas from the ambient air. This method is known as direct air capture (DAC) and is already practiced in other parts of Europe.\u00a0 As there is no limit to the amount of CO2 that can be captured, it is considered to have great potential. However, the main disadvantage is the cost \u2014 currently around \u20ac550 ($650) per ton. Some scientists believe that mass production of DAC systems could bring prices down to \u20ac50 per ton by 2050. It is already considered a key technology for future climate protection. Carbon capture facilities are still very expensive and take up a huge amount of space Another way of extracting CO2 from the air is via biomass. Plants grow and are burned in a power plant to produce electricity. CO2 is then extracted from the exhaust gas of the power plant and stored deep in the Earth. The big problem with this technology , known as bio-energy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is the huge amount of space\u00a0required. According to Felix Creutzig from the Mercator Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC) in Berlin, it will therefore only play \"a minor role\" in CO2 removal technologies. CO2 bound by rock minerals In this process, carbonate and silicate rocks are mined, ground and scattered on agricultural land or on the surface water of the ocean, where they collect CO2 over a period of years.\u00a0According to researchers, by the middle of this century it would be possible to capture two to four billion tons of CO2 every year using this technique. The main challenges are primarily the quantities of stone required, and building the necessary infrastructure . Concrete plans have not yet been researched. Not an option: Fertilizing the sea with iron The idea is use iron to fertilize the ocean, thereby increasing its nuturient content, which would allow plankton to grow stronger and capture more CO2. However, both the process and possible side effects are very controversial. \"This is rarely treated as a serious option in research,\" concludes SWP study authors Oliver Geden and Felix Schenuit. Adapted from German by Ineke Mules. Sea levels are now expected to rise even higher beyond the end of the century, putting coastal regions at extreme risk. Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner says the time for drawn-out discussions has passed \u2014 we need to act now. \u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Carbon capture: How can we remove CO2 from the atmosphere?", "article_name": "carbon-capture-paris-agreement-co2-emissions-soil-reforestation-biochar-biomass", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/carbon-capture-paris-agreement-co2-emissions-soil-reforestation-biochar-biomass/a-54717755", "date_published": "2020-09-28 00:00:00", "article_length": 6709, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:02:03.543173"}
{"id": null, "body": "     With this week's climate talks in Bali wrapping up, readers responded to our many articles covering the event with a degree of uncertainty about the human role in climate change. Is climate change real? The following comments reflect the views of DW-WORLD.DE readers. Not all reader comments have been published. DW-WORLD.DE reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content. Recent research by Danish and Swedish scientists are blowing the CO2 emissions theory away, demonstrating the influence of solar cycles on earth's temperature. If you don't think it's worth waiting until climate science gets this right before severely impacting industries and the developing nations, then knock yourselves out. -- John Barnes, USA I am not a scientist so I won't dispute whether the climate is changing or not. But as a layperson who likes to gather information on the issue myself, I am becoming increasingly disturbed by the amount of information I am finding (mostly Internet sources) from competent scientists who do dispute the validity of the \"scientific\" findings being drawn upon as a basis for the enormous commotion that we are seeing in the world regarding climate change and CO2. I think that, if there are valid scientific concerns regarding the validity/accuracy/reliability of the IPCC scientific data, world leaders should stop and consider before deciding to commit vast sums of money to solutions which may turn out to be totally wrong. -- Rick Tachek, Germany If you wonder why some of us are so obtuse as to be dubious of the scenarios portrayed by the media about global warming, just look at the item on your newscasts today [Dec. 13] in which a group claims that sea turtles may die out if the beaches on which they lay their eggs are inundated by rising sea levels. Oddly, sea turtles have been around for tens of millions of years, and have survived several changes in sea level before, including one at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago. The people making up these scenarios seem to have no idea of the geological past. If they did, they wouldn't make such stupid claims, unnecessarily adding to the hysteria about the subject. -- Douglas Ort, Thailand Denial is a natural human response when faced with very bad news or a serious prognosis -- even when the evidence is beyond proof. Think back to the arrest and prosecution of Galileo 300 years ago when he proved that the earth revolves around the sun. It took a long while for humans to accept that their old beliefs were wrong. It normally takes around 40 years for such a transition in belief to take place. Even the most brilliant brain ever -- Albert Einstein -- took some years to accept the theory of intercontinental drift, long after other scientists were convinced. I have pity on those few remaining folks who are having trouble accepting the news [about climate change], but I won't ridicule them any more than I would ridicule a person who cannot accept the news that their loved one has deceased. Denial is a natural response to a serious crisis. -- Chris Harries, Australia Germany's environment minister is leading EU efforts to push the US into accepting climate change targets, warning that if Washington blocks progress in Bali, EU nations will boycott US-led climate talks next month. (13.12.2007)\n\u00a0 Most environmental activists flew to the UN Climate Change Conference, leaving behind a huge carbon footprint.

These compelling photographs capture the consequences of global warming at the peak of their impact.\n Polar bears pushed to the brink Climate change is the single biggest threat to polar bear survival, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The animals depend on seasonal sea ice, which they use as a platform to hunt seals. Polar bears have been losing weight as Arctic sea ice melts, a recent study out of Canada found. Female polar bears weighed about 10 percent less in 2009 than they did in 1984, scientists found. As retreating sea ice shrinks their habitat, starvation threatens the species. Drought in Australia Droughts are becoming an increasingly frequent reality in Australia thanks to climate change shifting rain patterns. The Climate Council reported last year that since the mid-1990s, southeast Australia has experienced a 15 percent decrease in rainfall during early winter and late autumn. The photo below is a closeup of Wellshot Creek in Queensland, Australia's second-largest state - in March 2014, it suffered from its most widespread drought to date, with 80 percent of the region affected. Wellshot Creek in Australia during the drought in March 2014 China's dust bowl Formerly a phenomenon in regions home to 75 percent of the world's poor, the spread of deserts is largely a result of poor land use. And climate change is turning desertification into a global problem. China is one of many countries around the world affected by ever-worsening desertification. After more than 30 years of industrial growth powered by coal, China is now both a victim and one of the major culprits of climate change. A farmer transports water through the dust bowl in China's Huining region Flooding in Bangladesh Bangladesh is considered one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with severe floods triggered in part by increasing temperatures and rising sea levels. These wipe out crops and destroy homes on a regular basis. Scientists have projected that seas may rise around a meter this century - but even a 65-centimeter rise would swallow around 40 percent of Bangladesh's productive land, according to World Bank experts. A study by scientists at Climate Central in November 2015 suggested that 470 million to 760 million people across the globe could lose their land to rising seas if global warming is allowed to continue. A Bangladeshi child washes fish in front of a partially flooded home during tidal movements in Gabura in 2010 Colorado River running dry The Colorado River, a waterway that serves 40 million people in seven western states in the USA, is drying out. The Lake Powell reservoir, which lies along the river and plays a vital role in water delivery, is at only 45 percent of capacity. Fifteen years of diminishing snow falls in the Rocky Mountains, which feed the waterway, mean less water is flowing to the river. The Colorado River is crucial to for agriculture in California, as well as for growing cities across the American Southwest. A waterway off Lake Powell ran nearly dry in March 2015 Altered storm patterns and longer dry spells are resulting in lower river levels and prolonged fires in the Amazon region. This spells chaos for locals - with implications for ecosystems and further climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     Germany's environment agency has called for the government to bring in a raft of measures to limit carbon emissions from road traffic. Among the proposals are speed restrictions on Germany's autobahns. Germany's Federal Environment Agency has urged the government to introduce speed restrictions on the country's famously limit-free highways. The idea is included in a package of measures put forward to reduce carbon emissions from private vehicles on German roads. Read more: \u00a0 Everything you need to know about the German autobahn Germany's S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung on Thursday cited an internal document from the agency that urges drastic action to meet the country's climate targets. Among the proposals is the introduction of a maximum speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour (75 miles per hour) for vehicles on all German highways. Such restrictions would likely spark huge controversy. At present, there are no official speed limits on certain stretches of road and drivers regularly hurtle along at speeds of more than 200 kph. 'Ambitious but feasible' The unpublished policy paper also envisages a steep rise in tax on diesel \u2014\u00a0currently taxed at a lower rate than ordinary gasoline \u2014\u00a0of \u20ac0.70 ($0.78)\u00a0per liter by the year 2030. Such a rise would represent an increase of almost 60%. Petrol\u00a0would rise by \u20ac0.47.\u00a0 Proposals also include a sharp increase in road tolls for heavy goods trucks, and an abolition of the country's \"commuting allowance,\" which allows people traveling longer distances to work by car to claim tax rebates. \u00a0 Germany could face EU penalties if it fails to reduce greenhouse gas and poisonous nitrogen oxides emissions.\u00a0Observers consider the transport sector\u00a0as a key to meeting emissions reduction targets. Read more: \u00a0 German car lovers want to challenge Fridays for Future The country aims \u2014\u00a0by the year 2030 \u2014\u00a0to reduce its carbon emissions to 55% of the level they were in 1990. According to the document seen by the newspaper, those\u00a0goals were \"ambitious but feasible.\" No desire for limits In November, the Netherlands cut the daytime speed limit for traffic in the daytime to 100 kph, in an effort to tackle an emissions pollution crisis and improve air quality. The German government has already said it has\u00a0 no plans to introduce a speed limit on Germany's autobahn network. That came after a government-appointed commission on the future of mobility suggested an upper speed limit of 130 kph. And in\u00a0October,\u00a0German lawmakers overwhelmingly voted against a Greens proposal to impose speed limits . The only European country without a general speed limit on most parts of its highways, Germany nonetheless has an excellent network of motorways. They are generally well-maintained, inviting you to explore them. The minimum age for obtaining a driver's license used with a legal guardian present in Germany is 17. An unrestricted car driver's license can be granted at age 18. According to statistics by ADAC, Germany's national automobile association, traffic jams increased by around 15 percent in 2016 as compared to the previous year. That's a lot for a relatively small country. The increase resulted from both more cars on the highway, and more construction sites. So brace yourself for more time and stress in the car, especially around big cities. Even when you think you're soaring down the autobahn, you may get the distinct impression it's still not fast enough. Some German drivers may drive right up behind you and try to \"push\" you over. They may even flash their headlights to rattle your nerves. You aren't supposed to block the \"fast\" lane \u2014 the aim being to only use it for passing. But don't let pushy drivers bully you! Watch out for speed cameras! They are used widely in Germany, from the autobahn to inner city areas. These box-shaped devices are installed next to the road, and will often catch you unawares. Should you be driving over the speed limit, a ticket will be sent to your house, complete with a picture of you at the wheel and the license plate confirming your offense. Holding a cell phone in your hand while driving is an absolute no-no. If caught, you could be fined 100 euros ($124) and get a one-point penalty against your driver's license. Penalties spike up if you cause an accident, and you may have your license revoked. Fines were raised in 2017. Investing in a hands-free car kit is smarter. Penalties also apply to bicyclists using their cell phones. The same thing goes for not making way for emergency vehicles. Once traffic jams up, you are required to create a lane for ambulances and police, even before you see the flashing lights behind you. If not, you could be fined at least 200 euros (around $250) and get points on your license. The emergency lane is always between the far left and the rest of the lanes. You are also required to set up a warning signal should you break down or have an accident. This means placing an orange metal triangle on the road, donning a fluorescent jacket, both of which you must have in your car. You must also have a first-aid kit stored in your vehicle. In Germany, there's zero tolerance for beginners, as well as for professional drivers. There's a 0.05 percent blood alcohol content (BAC) limit to driving under the influence. Bicyclists may not exceed 0.16 percent. Penalties start at a \u20ac500 ($623) fine, points off your license and even a one-month license suspension. Best bet: don't drink and drive! Snow tires are required once streets become slick with slush, ice or snow. In Germany, the rule of thumb is that this can occur anytime between October and Easter. Should you not have snow tires installed on your car and still drive on slippery streets, you could be fined and have points taken off your license. Without proper snow tires, your insurance may also not cover an accident. To navigate both the German autobahn and city streets, the best approach is a zen one: take your time and don't let yourself get frazzled. Besides, with an expansive train and public transportation system in the country, you might not even want to hop into your car, but board a train and put up your feet!

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate law rollbacks in the US and Australia have origins in libertarian think tanks that trade in climate denial. Investigative journalists have exposed how one is now trying to strip climate protections in Germany. \"The Trump administration frequently asked us for advice,\" James Taylor, chief strategist at US libertarian and climate skeptic think tank, The Heartland Institute, told two journalists posing as PR consultants representing German car and coal companies in late 2019. \"What can we get for \u20ac500,000?\" one of the bogus young PRs asked, offering an anonymous donation to Heartland on behalf of a large German automotive client. Taylor soon pitched an anti-climate campaign that drew on Heartland's bona fides helping US President Donald Trump\u00a0 dismantle climate protections . Heartland has claimed it played a \"major role\" in Trump's decision to withdraw the world's largest historical greenhouse gas emitter from the Paris climate accord. Since then, the administration has rolled back the 2015 Clean Power Plan that set strict emissions limits in the lead-up to the\u00a0Paris climate conference, and which the president \u2014\u00a0who has claimed\u00a0that climate change is a Chinese hoax \u00a0and is pictured above minimizing future warming\u00a0\u2014 called \"a relentless war on American energy.\" Journalists Jean Peters und Katarina Huth go undercover as corporate PRs: They were soliciting a climate disinformation campaign by the Heartland institute Climate rollbacks In Germany, where car and coal companies are facing diesel bans and a coal phaseout by 2038, Heartland is offering anti-climate communications tools that have seemingly succeeded in tempering or reversing climate policies in the US. As revealed in\u00a0 The Heartland Lobby report resulting from a joint investigation by non-profit newsroom Correctiv and current affairs TV show, Frontal21, Heartland's proposed anti-climate spin campaign would focus on rolling back \"prohibitive climate laws\" in Germany. It would also push \"diesel instead of electric cars, energy from coal instead of wind turbines, industry growth instead of environmental protection.\" The meeting between Taylor and investigative journalists Jean Peters and Katarina Huth of Correctiv took place at a climate skeptic event in the shadows of the COP25 climate conference in Madrid in December. Peters told DW that Heartland's PR strategist offered two scientists who, if \"properly funded,\" would downplay the health impacts of diesel pollution and coal-fired power plants. The paid scientists and experts were part of what Peters calls a much broader \"strategy of disinformation.\" This included spreading doubt about the science of man-made climate change; and branding climate activists as hysterical \"alarmists,\" while climate skeptics are pitched as the \"rational\" actors in the debate. In line with Heartland's principle of \"free-market environmentalism,\" those advocating for fossil fuel cuts are to be painted as \"socialists who want to take away your freedom,\" according to Peters \u2014 repeating a strategy Heartland used to downplay the health risks of tobacco for clients like Philip Morris. To help get such messages across, Taylor offered the fake PRs the services of a young and upcoming\u00a0German YouTuber and \"influencer,\" Naomi Seibt.  'Anti-Greta' The 19-year-old was also in Madrid during the climate denial side event dubbed the Climate Reality Forum, where she spoke on behalf of Heartland. \"These days, what scientists say about climate change isn't really science,\" she said. Since her February 28 appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in the US, global media has dubbed the self-described \"climate realist\" as the \"anti-Greta,\" a rising counter to climate activist icon Greta Thunberg. Seibt has embraced the moniker, and during a FOX News interview on the eve of CPAC said that \"CO2 emissions are not actually harmful to the planet\" while also railing against \"climate change propaganda.\" Taylor told the undercover journalists that Seibt, whose YouTube videos are now generating upward of 150,000 views, would reiterate \"buzzwords\" and talking points on behalf of their client. Seibt is affiliated with Germany's far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD)\u00a0party \u2014 the country's third largest \u2014 that has ramped up its climate denialism in recent times. It has also promoted coal and diesel and demonized renewables. \"The amount of [AfD] social media posts attacking climate solutions has tripled over the last year, with Greta Thunberg being one of the most frequent targets,\" said Stella Schaller, project manager at adelphi , a Berlin-based environment and development\u00a0think tank. Schaller notes that the AfD gets most of its climate talking points from shadowy German climate skeptic association, the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), whose\u00a0funding sources are undisclosed. The Heartland Institute, which received funding from Exxon Mobil and the Koch Foundation in the past but now funnels most donations through a dark money foundation, runs an annual climate denial conference in Munich with EIKE, which is where the Correctiv journalists first met James Taylor. Read more :\u00a0 How right-wing nationalism fuels climate denial \u00a0 Outsized influence In Australia, climate disinformation campaigns with Heartland links have also helped to depress support for climate action and roll back protections. Nearly a decade ago, Australia instituted a carbon price and a tax on mining industry profits that made it a climate leader. But both those policies were repealed in 2014 following a misinformation campaign headed by Australia's incoming conservative prime minister at the time, Tony Abbott \u2014 a poster boy for the Heartland Institute and a speaker at climate skeptic conferences who fearmongered about a \"carbon tax.\" Six years later, Australia is ranked last in climate policy among developed nations. According to Australian scientist, author and climate analyst Ketan Joshi , a watershed moment in this reversal came in 2011 when Britain's arch climate denier, Lord Christopher Monckton,\u00a0 told mining industry leaders that Australia needed a news outlet akin to Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox News in the US to fight \"bogus\" climate science. Monckton also spoke at the Madrid climate skeptic conference in December.\u00a0 Murdoch's Sky News soon became that voice, says Joshi, the news channel hiring vocal climate skeptics as regular political pundits who call out \" global warming rubbish .\" Their voices also echo across Murdoch publications that make up around\u00a070% of the print media market in Australia.\u00a0 Naomi Seibt inevitably took her bow on Sky last week , telling viewers that Fridays for Future rallies in Germany had been infiltrated by radical anti-fascist protesters. Billed as the \"anti-Greta sensation,\" she also claimed that \"Greta Thunberg never talks about the science,\" and that climate alarmism will lead to \"energy poverty.\"\u00a0This despite Thunberg's now famous entreaty to \"listen to the scientists.\"\u00a0  'Instilling doubt' \"It's not about the science,\" says Joshi. \"It's about instilling doubt, it's about making people distrust information that they receive \u2014 even if it's from a trustworthy source.\"\u00a0 Back in Madrid, Taylor also offered the PRs the services of another young YouTuber, his daughter Tiffany. Her latest video argues that climate change has increased rainfall in Australia, and that the recent megafires were primarily caused by arsonists. The discredited theory that arson was to blame for the intensity of Australia's unprecedented bushfire season was pushed globally by climate deniers fighting back against the consensus that global heating is the culprit. Donald Trump, Jr, for example, helped the arsonist meme go viral by tweeting about an \"exclusive\" in Rubert Murdoch's The Australian newspaper that promoted the debunked theory .\u00a0\u00a0 The Heartland Lobby investigation aims to highlight the source of such obfuscation \u2014 or as Stella Schaller puts it, the ease with which companies \"purchase pseudo-experts, fake news and targeted misinformation on climate change\" \u2014 to ensure that climate protection rollbacks do not happen in Germany. But the truth may be no antidote to anti-climate PR. \"Fear and hope are often stronger than knowledge,\" Peters says. After lengthy talks, a government-appointed commission announces Germany plans to stop producing energy from coal-fired plants by 2038. Climate campaigners say it's too little, too late. Germany currently generates nearly 40% of its electricity from coal and has failed to meet targets set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The anticipated phaseout cost: \u20ac40 billion ($44 billion). After a five-year study, scientists warn two-thirds of glaciers in the Hindu-Kush-Himalayan region could melt by 2100 if global carbon emissions are not cut. Meltwater from the area, home to Mount Everest, feeds into 10 of the world's most important river systems. Water shortages would cripple food and energy production in eight countries, directly or indirectly affecting nearly 2 billion people. \"One of the deadliest storms on record in the Southern Hemisphere\" \u2014 according to the UN \u2014 hits low-lying Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, killing nearly 1,000 people and causing widespread damage. Vast swaths of farmland are flooded, bringing disease and food shortages. Six weeks later, another cyclone strikes. Some 62 million people were affected by extreme weather in 2018, says the WMO. Extinction Rebellion causes more than a week of travel chaos in London with disruptive, colorful protests across the British capital. In the UK and around the world, the activist group's rallies make headlines throughout the year as they promote radical political, economic and social change to avert the worst effects of global warming. Critics call their plans to abandon fossil fuels unrealistic. At the EU elections, voter turnout is up \u2014 and populist and environmentalist parties make big gains. European Green parties win 74 seats in the 751-member European Parliament. The German Greens take more than 20% of the vote, their best-ever results. Frans Timmermans is chosen as the European Commission's new climate chief, with the bloc aiming to cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Thousands of protesters descend on Garzweiler, one of Germany's biggest open-pit coal mines near Cologne, protesting plans to expand at the expense of nearby old-growth forest. Meanwhile, an estimated 40,000 people from across Europe march through Aachen to campaign for more climate action. Over the Channel, the UK parliament becomes the first in the world to declare a symbolic climate emergency. Much of Europe suffers through an intense heat wave, with temperatures breaking 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) across the continent \u2014 smashing records set just weeks earlier. People are advised to limit time spent outdoors, while travelers face delays due to speed restrictions on superheated railway tracks. Climate monitoring agencies report July as the hottest month on record. The number of forest fires in the Amazon surges to its highest point since 2010, and thousands of firefighters are deployed to put out the blaze. President Jair Bolsonaro blasts a global outcry that not enough is being done to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest, insisting on Brazil's sovereign right. Previously, he blamed rainforest protections for hindering economic development. Teen activist Greta Thunberg, who inspired Fridays for Future protests worldwide, blasts world leaders at the United Nations for \"failing to act\" on the climate crisis. \"Change is coming, whether you like it or not.\" As millions of young people join marches around the world, leaders from more than 70 countries commit to carbon neutrality by 2050 \u2014 but not China, Russia, India, Japan or China. Local groups, cities and young people around the world increasingly take their climate concerns to court in 2019. Just this month: a group of 15 youths (above) sues the Canadian government for violating their fundamental rights with policies that fail to curb CO2 emissions. Over in Germany, a court rejects a lawsuit by three farming families against Berlin's failed climate mitigation efforts. Venice is hit by exceptional floods, with water levels topping 1.5 meters (nearly 5 feet) three times in one week \u2014 the worst flooding since records began in 1872. Famed monuments and museums, including St. Mark's Basilica and the crypt, are inundated. Undeterred tourists, however, continue to snap selfies. Meanwhile, Oxford English Dictionary names \"climate emergency\" its word of the year. As world leaders meet in Madrid for the COP25 climate conference, the head of the UN says the world is rapidly approaching the \"point of no return.\" An EU report says the environmental situation has worsened, with the bloc likely to miss 2030 carbon reduction targets. Reacting to climate concerns, the European Parliament declares a \"climate emergency\" and the EU Commission lays out its Green Deal.

{"id": null, "body": "     Plastic pollution and overfishing may currently be in the headlines. But rising CO2 emissions are also a key threat to the ocean that covers 71 percent of the planet, and a major challenge for future life on Earth. Frank Bainimarama knows all about the need to protect the ocean. As the prime minister of Fiji, he runs a country made up of more than 300 islands in the South Pacific. This week, he's\u00a0been co-hosting the first ever UN conference on the ocean\u00a0in New York, along with Sweden's Climate Minister Isabella Lovin, focusing on sustainable development and conservation of the world's oceans, seas and marine resources. Speaking to the\u00a0assembled leaders from government, science, business and civil society, Bainimarama -\u00a0also the incoming president of this year's UN Climate Conference\u00a0in November -\u00a0made it clear that ocean protection and climate change are inextricably linked. \"Climate change poses the biggest threat the world has ever known,\" he said. \"And the quality of our oceans and seas is also deteriorating at an alarming rate. They are interlinked, because rising sea levels, as well as ocean acidity and warmer waters, have a direct effect on our reefs and fish stocks and the prosperity of our coastal communities.\" Fiji's prime minister (left) was in Berlin for climate talks in May In hot water 2016 was not only the warmest year \u00a0on record, as far as our planet's atmospheric temperature is\u00a0concerned. In its \"Statement on the State of the Global Climate 2016,\" published earlier this year, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that globally averaged sea-surface temperatures had also hit record levels. Scientists were surprised at the speed at which sea temperatures have risen. In the last century, the 15 years with the highest ocean heat anomalies have all been within the last two decades, according to data from the United States' National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). And the WMO report\u00a0predicts that the trend will\u00a0continue. \"The extra carbon dioxide that gets released into the atmosphere through our fossil fuels and deforestation is associated with extra heat,\" explained\u00a0Susan Avery, an atmospheric physicist and president emerita of the renowned Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,\u00a0 in an interview with DW \u00a0last October. \"And 93 percent\u00a0of the extra warming is actually in the ocean.\" Earlier this year, Avery became the first climate scientist to join the board of ExxonMobil. Migrants and aliens Warming seas play havoc with the organisms that live there, completely changing their living conditions\u00a0to the extent where some are no longer able to survive in their traditional habitat. Mojib Latif, head of research on ocean circulation and climate dynamics at the Geomar\u00a0Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research\u00a0in Kiel, told DW that the ocean\u00a0isn't\u00a0just warming on the surface, but\u00a0down to a depth of 2,000 meters (around 6,500 feet), \"a giant volume.\" That heat will still be present\u00a0- and will slowly escape from the ocean -\u00a0for centuries to come. \"This is basically why global warming will continue even if we don't really emit any greenhouse gases any longer,\" he\u00a0said. Atlantic cod are moving further north into Arctic waters Fish species are moving toward the poles\u00a0in search of cooler water, and\u00a0 alien species are moving in to replace the traditional residents in warming waters. Coral reefs are perhaps the best-known victims of ocean warming. They are frequently in the headlines, most notably Australia's famous Great Barrier Reef, which has been devastated by bleaching. \"Corals don't have very great temperature tolerance. So if the oceans warm by more then 1.5 degrees [Celsius] or so, they would probably die,\" said Latif. \"And it's well possible that without climate protection, all tropical corals will be gone by the middle of the century.\" Extreme weather Warming seas are also influencing the world's weather patterns, and scientists are expecting increases in extreme weather events. The El Nino weather event, a natural cycle, illustrates what happens when the ocean warms. Some have attributed the extreme rainfall and flooding in Peru earlier this year to warming seas \"El Ninos are events that are characterized by enormously high sea surface temperatures,\" said Latif.\u00a0He attributed the extreme rainfall and flooding in Peru earlier this year to extremely warm water off the coast.\u00a0\"Sea temperatures off Peru are slowly warming.\" The question is whether global change is having an influence on the climate of South America. \"What we can say is that El Ninos have become more frequent during the recent decades and they have somehow became stronger during the last 20 years,\" said Latif. \"Whether this is already a trend or not is hard to say, but some climate models actually project that this is exactly what's going to happen in response to climate change.\" Warmer water, rising seas Recent research shows sea levels are rising almost three times as fast as they were 25 years ago. Experts say ocean warming has been responsible for about half the sea level rise that we have observed during the last century, as warmer water expands. The other key factor is melting ice, as the world warms. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is working on a special report on the ocean and climate change, to be finalized in September 2019. It will include information on ice melt in Greenland and in the Antarctic, including the East Antarctic, long thought to be immune to global\u00a0warming. Greenland's massive ice sheet is melting faster than ever Hans P\u00f6rtner, of\u00a0Germany's polar and marine research center the Alfred Wegener Institute, is co-chair of an IPCC working group which focuses on impacts, vulnerabilities\u00a0and adaptation possibilities for humans\u00a0under climate change. He views this area as one of most challenging. \"We have increased awareness that previous estimates of sea level rise have been too conservative,\" he told DW. Looking back at the Earth's history, he said, \"we know that during the last interglacial period, with 0.7 to 2\u00a0degrees global warming\u00a0above pre-Industrial levels -\u00a0these are the comparable numbers to where we are today -\u00a0we had a sea level of around 7 meters [about 23 feet]\u00a0higher. And if we compare and look back at the last period in Earth's history where we had 400 parts per million CO2 - and that's also where we are now - we had a similar degree of higher sea level.\" So far, however, countries have based their adaptation and coastal protection measures on earlier, more conservative estimates. \"They will have to increase their ambition in coastal protection. And in several examples, we will have to give land back to the oceans. We may not be able to protect the land because sea level may actually reach 2\u00a0meters or even more by the end of the century,\"\u00a0P\u00f6rtner said. Upsetting the conveyor belt The influx of melting ice doesn't just lead to rising sea levels, as atmospheric physicist Susan Avery explained. \"When the land-based ice\u00a0comes into the ocean, you get a freshening of certain parts of the ocean, so particularly the sub-polar North Atlantic. So you have a potential for interfacing with our normal thermohaline circulation systems, which could dramatically change that,\" she said.\u00a0\"The changes in salinity are beginning to be noticed, and changes in salinity are a signal that the water cycle is becoming more vigorous.\" Scientists describe these systems as the \"global conveyor belt\"\u00a0that links the oceans of the world and in turn influences climate. One example is the Gulf Stream system , which is to a large extent responsible for the temperate climate of Europe and parts of North America. A study released this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \u00a0in the US\u00a0suggests that if the ice influx increases far enough, the disruption of the ocean current system could also have devastating consequences in Africa, with a disruption in rainfall patterns playing havoc with agriculture. As global warming speeds up, so does the rise in sea levels. While 2004 to 2010 saw oceans rise by about 15 millimeters in total, this value doubled for 2010 to 2016. Tropical regions in the western Pacific are especially affected, threatening many of the coastal areas and low-lying islands with submersion by the end of the century. As ocean and atmospheric temperatures increase, glaciers and ice caps shrink in size. In 2016, the global sea ice extent was 4 million square kilometers (1.54 million square miles) below average. Consequently, more meltwater flows into rivers and oceans, which also causes sea levels to rise. Some ocean regions have already warmed by more than 3 degrees Celsius, upsetting marine ecosystems. Seventy-two percent of demersal fish species in the northeast Atlantic Ocean have so far been affected, with warming limiting their abundance and spread. Species that live in tropical ocean waters, like the clownfish, are also experiencing habitat-related population decreases. Warming and acidifying waters affect Nemo's navigation senses, and also threaten his home - coral reefs, one of the most sensitive marine ecosystems. A water temperature increase of as much as 3 degrees Celsius can cause the death of corals and the marine animal species that live in them. Northern parts of Great Barrier Reef have seen coral mortality rates of 50 percent. With increased ocean heat, extremely strong tropical storms are set to occur much more frequently. One of these massive storms was Hurricane Matthew, which hit Haiti in October 2016. The Haitian government put the official death toll at 546, and the hurricane also caused $15 billion (13.8 billion euros) in economic losses on the island nation and in the US, Cuba and the Bahamas. There is a strong correlation between atmospheric wind patterns and ocean temperatures, meaning warming waters may also cause the jet stream to get stronger. This could affect airplane travel due to intensified head- and tailwinds. On the upside, this means that some flights may be much faster. On the downside, other flights may take longer and could experience more turbulence. Author: Jessie-May Franken An acid bath? Alongside the extra heat, the CO2 we have indirectly been dumping into the ocean has another devastating impact. \"The extra carbon dioxide, when it gets dissolved into the ocean, through various simple chemical equations, will increase the PH or acidification in the ocean,\" Avery explained. Seawater is already at least 26 percent more acidic than it was before the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, according to the \"State of the Ocean\" report published by the International Programme on the State of the Ocean back in 2013. The report found the ocean\u00a0could be 170 percent more acidic by the end of the century. Mesocosms, closed environments, are used for ocean acidification experiments in nature Over the last 20 years, scientists around the world have been conducting laboratory experiments to find out what that would mean for the flora and fauna of the ocean. Ulf Riebesell, a professor of biological oceanography at Geomar, conducted the world's first experiments in nature\u00a0off the coast of the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in 2010. The on-site\u00a0experiments showed that increasing acidification decreases the amount of calcium carbonate in seawater, making life very difficult for sea creatures that use it to form their skeletons or shells. This change will affect coral, mussels, snails, sea urchins and\u00a0starfish, as well as fish and other organisms, Riebesell told DW. \"Some of these species will simply not be able to compete with others in the ocean of the future,\" he said. That could have severe economic and social consequences, as acidification ultimately\u00a0affects the food chain. Riebesell pointed\u00a0out that coral reefs, for instance, are home to numerous species, serve as nurseries for fish, attract tourists and protect coastlines against waves and storms. Riebesell has headed the German project BIOACID \u00a0(Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification)\u00a0for the last eight years. It's expected to publish\u00a0a summary of its results ahead of the UN climate conference in Bonn in November. Oceans cover more than two-thirds of our planet and give us food, energy and other resources. But worldwide, this fantastic underwater world is in danger. Is there still time to prevent the worst? (07.06.2017) In some parts of Australia's much-loved reef, 70 percent of the coral has been killed by bleaching. Australia is pledging vast amounts of money to mitigate the loss and stop a UNESCO downgrade of its status. (29.05.2017) According to a new study, the world's oceans are rising almost three times as fast as they were 25 years ago. Scientists say coastal regions face a much greater risk than previously thought. (24.05.2017) Hot problem for cold water Polar areas are most affected by ocean acidification, as cold water is able to more quickly absorb\u00a0CO2. Experiments in the Arctic, which is already warming around twice as fast as the global average, indicate that the seawater there could become corrosive within a few decades, Riebesell said. \"That means the shells and skeletons of some sea creatures would simply dissolve.\" At a working meeting of the BIOACID group in Kiel last week, IPCC co-chair Hans P\u00f6rtner told DW that ocean acidification, a relatively young research field, had already made its way into the policy arena. \"It's being considered as one of the climate challenges for the ocean, and it's also considered in the context of sustainable food supply, especially for developing countries,\" he said. But even countries like the United States are already feeling the effect, said\u00a0P\u00f6rtner. On the country's west coast, ocean acidification is already threatening oyster cultures, and he said this economic impact has increased awareness of the problem. Scientists are also concerned that the increasing amount of CO2 being stored in the ocean could, in turn, create a feedback effect that could further exacerbate global warming. In the long run, the ocean will become the biggest sink for human-produced CO2, but it will absorb it at a slower rate. \"Its buffer capacity will decrease, the more acidic the ocean becomes,\" said\u00a0Riebesell. Science and policy P\u00f6rtner told DW that\u00a0the writing is on the wall. \"We really have to go into ambitious mitigation, if we want to have a chance to keep this under control.\" Carol Turley, senior scientist at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK, is highlighting the issue of ocean acidification at the UN conference in New York this week. She told DW that a combination of local management measures and global action were necessary to protect the ocean and implement the UN's sustainable development goals. \"Although acidification, warming, sea level rise and oxygen loss represent global challenges requiring international agreements, there are varied options for reducing other stressors while efforts continue to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere,\" she said. Turley said it was \"inspiring\"\u00a0that UN\u00a0Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0and the co-chairs of the ocean conference, Fiji and Sweden, had recognized the key role of climate-related ocean stressors, including ocean acidification, and that\u00a0the combined impact of these may threaten the implementation of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14), which focuses on the ocean\u00a0and life below water. She said it was also heartening to hear their messages of hope.\u00a0\"It's not too late to fix the ocean. This shows how the evidence from science has been taken up by policy makers,\" she said. Carol Turley of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory has been highlighting the issue of ocean acidification in New York this week 'Stay optimistic' Martina Stiasny, a young climate scientist from the Geomar\u00a0Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research\u00a0in Kiel, Germany, told conference participants in New York about her research on how climate change-induced ocean acidification is affecting fisheries. \"We are already starting to see the first effects in the oceans,\" she told DW.\u00a0\"It's imperative that we start to act now. Otherwise it poses a serious threat to the health of the marine ecosystems and food security. It's not only important for the SDG 14, but also links to most other SDGs in terms of human health, fighting hunger and poverty and most other goals.\" The landmark ocean conference has been taking place against the background of US President Donald Trump's decision to take the US\u00a0out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a move Stiasny describes as a \"major disappointment.\" But she takes heart from the widespread movement to press ahead with emissions reductions and a transition to renewable energy. \"The statement that America made by pulling out is of course the wrong message to send to the world,\" she said. \"But fighting climate change is done every day by everyone on this planet and I believe we have no choice but to stay optimistic.\" \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate change: A simmering threat to our ocean", "article_name": "climate-change-a-simmering-threat-to-our-ocean", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-a-simmering-threat-to-our-ocean/a-39160034", "date_published": "2017-06-08 00:00:00", "article_length": 17081, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:02:07.485240"}

And scientists say if action isn't taken soon, it's only going to get worse. A dry grass fire in Siberia, about 75 kilometers wide, is seen in this photo from the EU's Copernicus Sentinel satellite In late May, a massive fuel spill\u00a0 flooded waterways\u00a0and a freshwater lake \u00a0near the Arctic city of Norilsk in Siberia.

In 2007, the Northwest Passage in Arctic Canada was ice free for the first time since satellite records began In fact, Siberia's summer temperatures can even peak in the 30s \u2014\u00a0so then just how much of a problem are\u00a0 the heat waves of recent years ? The short answer: a big one.\u00a0 \"We've had decades of warming in this region\u2026 [and] it's warming faster than anywhere else on the planet,\" said Thomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics. The first half of this year was\u00a0unseasonably\u00a0warm, with temperatures in July nearly 10 degrees above average.\u00a0In June, the mercury in the town of Verkhoyansk, located north of the Arctic Circle,\u00a0 hit 38 C \u2014\u00a0which is believed\u00a0to be\u00a0a record .\u00a0 Even worse,\u00a0the winters are also getting warmer.\u00a0This year's\u00a0was the warmest in 130 years of observations, according to the Russian Hydrometeorological Research Center.

But, they're more frequent and more intense. \"The fire season is longer. Now it comes early and ends later,\" said Anton Beneslavskiy of Greenpeace Russia. The degraded landscape left after a wildfire prevents\u00a0the growth of healthy, mature trees which are more resistant to blazes. Instead, they're replaced by more flammable shrubs and grassland. According to Smith, the fires\u00a0north of the Arctic Circle\u00a0in June 2019 and June 2020 combined were more intense than \"the previous 16 Junes put together.\"\u00a0 His\u00a0recent observations \u00a0have estimated that\u00a0between 2 and 4 million hectares of land\u00a0are\u00a0currently ablaze\u00a0in the\u00a0Arctic, releasing more than 16 megatons of CO2\u00a0into the atmosphere\u00a0in June alone.\u00a0 The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) estimates that\u00a0 roughly\u00a0100 megatons of CO2 were released by June fires in\u00a0Sakha Republic and neighboring Chukotka, across the Bering Strait from Alaska.\u00a0That's\u00a0roughly equivalent\u00a0to\u00a0the annual fossil fuel emissions released by Belgium\u00a0in 2017.\u00a0 Increased risk of\u00a0'zombie fires' \u00a0 Smith believes that roughly\u00a0half of the fires sweeping Siberia are on peatland,\u00a0naturally wet\u00a0carbon-rich\u00a0soil several meters deep made up of partly decayed plant matter that accumulates over thousands of years. With climate change, this peat layer is more likely to dry out and become a tinderbox just waiting to ignite.\u00a0And\u00a0burning\u00a0peat releases 10 to 100 times more carbon than a burning tree, according to Guillermo Rein, a professor of fire science at Imperial College London.\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 How climate change is hitting Scotland's whisky industry Peat fires are especially difficult to put out \"Every single time peat burns, it is a net carbon contribution to climate change.

And some peat fires are known to last for months.\"\u00a0They have\u00a0even\u00a0been known to\u00a0survive\u00a0underground\u00a0through\u00a0the winter months\u00a0as\u00a0\"zombie fires,\"\u00a0flaring\u00a0up again\u00a0on the surface\u00a0in the spring.

The image shows an aerial view of the wildfires in Russia's Siberia. Massive forest fires are a common occurrence in the region, but the magnitude of this year's blazes has reached an exceptional level with fears of a long-term effect on the environment. More than 3.2 million hectares (7.9 million acres) were on fire on Monday alone, mainly in the vast regions of Yakutia in the north and Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk in Siberia, authorities said. The fires, triggered by dry thunderstorms in temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), were spread by strong winds, Russia's federal forestry agency said. The picture shows a woman taking part in firefighting exercises for volunteers at the Mechta [Dream] forest summer camp outside Moscow. Russian authorities have been slow to declare emergencies and firefighting efforts have been scaled back over economic concerns. The lackluster response has prompted residents to post pleas for help and demands for action online. The fires could exacerbate climate change, warn experts. Greenpeace says almost 12 million hectares have been burnt this year, causing significant CO2 emissions and reducing the future capacity of forest to absorb the carbon dioxide. Some scientists posted satellite images from NASA showing the clouds of smoke reaching Arctic areas. The smoke from the wildfires has affected not only small settlements, but also major cities in western Siberia and the Altai region as well as the Urals such as Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg, and disrupted air travel. The image shows how the smoke has enveloped the city of Kemerovo in southern Siberia. Author: Srinivas Mazumdaru \n This is an updated version of a previous article.

{"id": null, "body": "     Soils are a double-edged climate sword. They are huge reservoirs of organic carbon and can act as a carbon sink. But they can also release CO2 into the atmosphere when used unsustainably. Forests are often called the lungs of the planet because of the way they \"breathe\"\u00a0in carbon dioxide. The role they play\u00a0in locking in carbon dioxide is so essential UN schemes promote forests conservation as a way to offset greenhouse gas emissions. Soils, meanwhile \u2014 less beautiful, and oft forgotten beneath our feet \u2014 get less press. Yet they hold 70 percent of the planet\u2019s land-based carbon \u2014 four times as much as all the world\u2019s biomass and three times the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Agriculture is responsible for around 13 of global greenhouse gas emissions. But if farms managed their soils more sustainably, they could lower that share considerably, scientists say. And not only would they emit less greenhouse gases \u2014 as carbon reservoirs, agricultural soils could even mop up carbon already in the atmosphere. And that\u2019s a win-win situation because once in the soil, carbon fertilizes plants, boosting agricultural yields. Carbon \u2013 a valuable resource Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Some is released back into the atmosphere and some is stored in plant matter. When that biomass is broken down by microorganisms in the soil, it becomes an organic material called humus, which nourishes plants and other organisms, conserves water and balances the soil\u2019s pH level. \"This carbon is like the fuel for any soil,\" Ronald Vargas, soils and land officer at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told DW. Carbon can remain locked into the soil for millennia. But when human beings interfere with the soil to grow commercial crops, it is often released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. \"In many parts of the world, agricultural practices have led to significant loss of carbon,\" Rolf Sommer, expert on soils and landscapes for sustainability with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, told DW. Since the industrial revolution began, 50 to 70 percent of the carbon in soil has been released into the atmosphere, much of it from agricultural land in the tropics. Healthier ways to farm But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Sommer and his team have shown that properly managing soils could almost double their capacity to store carbon, so they absorb between 9 to 18 percent of the carbon we currently emit by burning fossil fuels. Improving the health of soils\u00a0should be simple, Vargas said. First, we need to switch to organic fertilizers such as manure. We also need to stop encroaching on natural grasslands to expand farmland. Practices like mulching crop residues and plant off-cuts back into the soil can also boost its carbon content. Georg Guggenberger, professor at the Institute of Soil Science in Hannover, believes catch crops \u2014 fast-growing crops grown in the space or time between main crops \u2014 are one of the best ways to increase the amount of carbon in soils, at least in Europe. \"Catch crops are taking up CO2 from the atmosphere and when they die, they add more carbon to the soil,\" Guggenberger told DW. Catch crops are also great for nutrient management, Guggenberger said, reducing the need for mineral fertilizers that deplete soils\u2019 humus content, introduce toxins into the food chain and release greenhouses gases like nitrous oxide. Barriers to overcome With all these benefits, sustainable farming might seem a no-brainer. But switching to sustainable practices comes at a price and farmers, particularly in the tropics, can\u2019t always afford to switch better soil management. Experts say the use of heavy machinery to treating soils should be largely avoided For example, many farmers already use their organic waste to feed livestock, rather than leaving it on the soils, Sommer explains. And any change in how a farm is run demands initial investment. \"Most of the farmers in the tropics have no cash for the planting time, after the dry season,\"\u00a0Sommer said. \"They would love to invest in manure fertilizer, for instance, but they can\u2019t. And if they have a bad year, they don\u2019t get back the money they invested.\" Sommer says microloans and crop insurance can offset the financial risk of investing in greener ways to farm. \u00a0 Subsidizing catch crops \u2014 as the European Union does \u2014 can also help improve soil quality. \"If you go to Eastern Europe at this time of the year, you won\u2019t see as much bare soil as 10 years ago,\" Guggenberger said. Perhaps the most fundamental problem though, is lack of awareness that there are better ways to use the land. \"In many countries, farmers are left alone and don\u2019t receive new practices or technologies that could help them implement such good practices,\" Vargas said. \"Other countries keep clearing the land and are not leaving vegetation or crop residues on the surface \u2014 which does not help,\" he added. hHealthy soil is good for the environment and for farmers And then, there is a need for stronger policies. Vargas says that across the globe, there is a lack of national policies supporting better soil management. On the right track But things are beginning to change. On a global level, there is a growing realization that protecting our soils is essential \u2014 both to the climate and our food supply \u2014 and a rising number of countries are starting to take action. \"At the COP23 climate conference, soils were finally recognized as an important element for the fight of climate change,\" Vargas said. \"Now, we need to show the benefits not only for the environment and the fight against climate change, but also for farmers.\" Guggenberger said we have a choice to make: \u201cuse soils to mitigate climate change or, instead, lead them to release CO2 into the atmosphere, making things worse.\" Properly managed soils can reduce the carbon in our atmosphere \u2014 which is essential if we are to fulfil the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees. Still, Sommer warns that carbons sinks are only part of the solution. Locking away carbon doesn\u2019t mean we can keep supporting coal-fired plants. \"That is certainly not the message we want to convey,\" he said. \"We need a combination of various measures that can make a difference \u2014 soils alone won\u2019t save the climate.\" The story goes that when an earthworm is split in two, both parts will live on. That's not exactly right. Only the front of the worm can survive such a trauma. Even then, it doesn't always make it. All of the worm's vital organs are here but if too much of the gut is missing or the wound becomes infected, the half worm won't recover. Worms satisfy their hunger with the remnants of dead plants. They also graze on bacteria, algae, single-cell organisms and fungal threads located in their tunnels. Because earthworms have no teeth, they compost organic material by sticking food to the walls of underground burrows and layering excrement over it. This creates a perfect environment for pre-digesting microorganisms. The earthworm's cast material \u2013 also known as worm poop \u2013 helps create good soil's fine crumb structure. Each year, the animals will lay a 0.5 centimeter crumb layer on the soil surface. But if they are really industrious and conditions are right, it can be up to five centimeters. These casts are packed full of nutrients that provide food for fungi and help prevent soil erosion. Earthworms have a head and tail, although that may be hard to tell at first glance. If the animal is at reproductive age, a thick band, called a clitellum, is visible. The head is located closest to this band. An earthworm's tunnel system is a big boon to the soil. It allows water to flow more quickly through the ground and provides ventilation. Plants also push their roots through the many, many tunnels created by earthworms. A 50-hectare farm can house up to 400,000 kilometers of underground passages. An earthworm's true domain, as its name betrays, is underground. But at times, the animal is lured above ground by the vibration of raindrops hitting the earth's surface. There, dangerous UV-light and hungry birds await. A ground without earthworms behaves like a blocked drain when it rains. Water can no longer flow down through the soil. Even the smallest amounts of water can cause flooding over time. However, when worms are present and working diligently, soil can deal with the intake of water and surplus liquid ends up in springs and wells. The number of earthworms living in the soil depends on how the land is cultivated. In monocultures, where many machines and pesticides are used, you'll find around 30 animals per square meter. But the same amount of soil on a farm that practices multi-cropping can contain up to 120 animals. In optimum conditions, up to several hundred of the invertebrates may be working silently underground. What links climate change, poverty and migration?

{"id": null, "body": "     Scientists say feeding cows good quality grass would boost their productivity \u2014 which is better overall for the climate. Experts explain to DW how that helps tackle global warming \u2014 and why it's a challenge in Africa. DW: How does feeding cattle Napier grass help tackle climate change? Lutz Merbold: So what we basically do is baseline the environmental footprint of the current diet of animals. In other words, we look at what they're eating and then quantify the climate impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and then we\u00a0look\u00a0at options on how to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions without hampering animal production. And one of the things we're testing is Napier grass.  Scientist Lutz Merbold from the ILRI I think it's a bit more complex than just focusing on Napier grass itself because the whole point is that there is no silver bullet on this, or that this is the best grass. It doesn't really matter which grass, if it's a good palatable grass of good quality and quantity then it's going to be fine. The point is how you cultivate this specific grass, because that has an effect on how well it can be digestible for an animal and how much methane it produces. So just feeding Napier grass doesn't necessarily reduce methane emissions, as it depends on the quality and quantity of Napier grass or any other grass which is fed. So anything we do, no matter if it's Napier grass or whatever, whatever diet you've been giving which meets the demand of an animal properly and consistently will boost productivity. It will also increase methane emissions but not as quickly as it boosts productivity and that's the reason why the ratio [of productivity against methane emissions]\u00a0comes down. Fetching fodder for livestock in Lushoto, Tanzania So by boosting yields from the animal, be it meat or milk, at a greater rate than the methane the animal is producing, that's what makes feeding animals quality forage better for the climate. What have the challenges been in Africa? Scientist Chris Jones from the ILRI Chris Jones: It's a system where animals are underfed and malnourished, and they're also challenged by the various pests and diseases and therefore the productivity in this part of the world is very low compared to more developed systems. Merbold: We see regularly that you have Napier grass in a plot of a farmer who doesn't even fertilize it. But then many farmers let it grow until it's two meters high. But as soon as it's that high it's a lot of biomass but it's really\u00a0poor quality, it becomes almost like a \"woody\" vegetation, which is very difficult to eat for a ruminant like a cow. The typical suggestion is to harvest a Napier grass plant every eight to 10 weeks when it's approximately a meter\u00a0high because then you have the best quality, the most energy in the plant. There's a lot of sugars etc. which are easily digestible for an animal, so that the animal can actually grow and then, of course, it will also produce methane. But if it just eats the really old stuff, it will chew on it and chew on it and try to digest it. This\u00a0will\u00a0actually lead to more methane but less production.  Cows' productivity increases if they eat better fodder, making it better for the climate overall So this is partly about increasing awareness among farmers in Africa that they shouldn't let their Napier grass grow above a certain height? Merbold: Exactly, that's one thing. And also if you keep animals, that you should actually have a forage grass plot cultivated so that you can feed your animals, because quite often this is not the case. The animals often just get plant residues from maize or Napier that is grown at the roadside. Or then people just send their cattle into a forest, which you also want to avoid because that leads to a certain degradation of forests. But again land sizes are small and very often the land a farmer has is rather used for the cultivation of maize or some vegetables, for example. Once you have certain manure amounts available on your farm, you want to apply it where you get the highest revenue, and that is probably a maize field or a vegetable garden. Many farmers prefer to grow more valuable crops than animal fodder on their land Even if you have a\u00a0Napier plot but you don't fertilize it, your yields go down over time. The crucial point is that you're always taking something away. As soon as you harvest, you take nitrogen, for instance, away from your field. If you don't bring that back to the field in the form\u00a0of manure you're starting to mine nutrients from your soil and that is what is continuously happening in Africa and leads to low soil health. If you want to have a cow which really produces, you need to feed it properly. For that you need to cultivate the field to forage grasses, you need to fertilize that etc. But that's not happening everywhere. There is a lack of manure in some places. So it's not as\u00a0simple a solution as just suggesting a grass, you always have to look at the system.  Scientists say there should be more awareness of the benefits of growing good-quality fodder Why is it better that cattle eat Napier grass rather than grazing in the forest? Jones: So it's basically about nutritional quality. The more productive an animal, the less emissions per unit of productivity. So the basic thing is that when they graze in the forests they're basically scavenging or going out looking for a low quality forage,\u00a0which\u00a0is anything that an animal will eat. Whereas what we would say is that if you plant forage and manage it correctly, you have much more productivity per unit area, a much higher quality of\u00a0feed\u00a0going into the animal.  Many farmers in Africa can't afford to put fertilizer on animal fodder, prefering to use what little manure they have elsewhere Is there a suggestion that we then give more land over to Napier grass or similar kinds of grass production and therefore clear forests to make way for better cultivated Napier grass? Merbold: You shouldn't clear forests. That's not an option as these are big carbon storages and also hotspots for biodiversity. But what you can do is\u00a0basically do a better farm management. In the end an improved farm management allows you to gain more from your land. If you want to keep cattle and you want to produce something with cattle then you need to cultivate the forages and by that you are improving a system and your emission intensities emissions of methane per kilogram of product, such as kilogram of meat, go down. If not, those remain relatively high. Lutz Merbold is head of the\u00a0Mazingira Centre at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Kenya.\u00a0Chris Jones is program\u00a0leader of Feed and Forage Development at ILRI. The interviews were carried out by Melanie Hall. The axolotl, also known as the Mexican walking fish, is an amphibian considered one of the world's most unusual and unique species of salamanders. Axolotls don't undergo metamorphosis when they reach adulthood, like most insects or amphibians (caterpillars and tadpoles, for example). They have a unique ability to regenerate their organs and lost limbs \u2014 including, of course, their feet. The foot of the giant Northern Luzon cloud rat next to the foot of a pygmy cloud rat. Both animals live in Southeast Asia, in the Philippines. Technically, they aren't actually rats but rather tree-dwelling herbivores. Their habitat and behavior is like that of a squirrel. And their feet are very well suited for climbing trees, and scuttling away quickly from predators. Geckos are a type of lizard that are found on almost every continent in the world. They love to eat insects and spiders for lunch. And they can move just like Spiderman with their sticky feet. Geckos have microscopic hairs, called setae, on their toes. The hairs are only few nanometers in diameter and enable the reptiles to climb up even the slickest of surfaces. When this \"Jesus Christ lizard\" is fleeing from predators it gathers speed and runs on its two back feet. Common basilisks have large hind feet with scaly fringes on the sides of the third, fourth and fifth toes. When jumping into the water, pockets of air form between the toes. With each step the pockets are newly filled. Smaller basilisks can run on water for up to 20 meters. Water striders don't need to run to stay above the water, like the basilisk does. The surface tension keeps them afloat. The bottoms of their feet are covered with thousands of microscopic hairs \u2014 similar to the gecko. Tiny grooves between the hairs make the legs water-resistant. The water strider likes to hunt smaller insects on the water's surface. Goats are funny creatures, just as much at home on rocky mountains and ice as they are climbing trees. Their unique hooves give them incredible grip and traction on even the most slippery, rocky terrain. Mountain goats can jump over gaps several meters long. They use their unique climbing skills to evade predators, such as bears, mountain lions or wolves. Bats can see in the dark using a special sonar system called \"echolocation.\" When they aren't flying, they spend the day hanging upside down in dark spaces. Their feet are designed as the perfect climbing tools, clinging to rocky and woody surfaces. When upside down, the pure weight of the animals holds their claws in a closed position \u2014 they don't need muscles to keep their claws tightly gripped. Orangutans are known for their long, curved fingers and toes. Having four \"hands\" is certainly better than just two. Their feet and hands are very similarly structured and perfectly designed for climbing up trees, gripping and swinging. Orangutans live in the rainforest, mostly above ground where they are protected from ground dwelling predators. Horses usually weigh between 400 and 900 kilograms (880 to 2000 pounds). The hoof helps absorb 70 to 80 percent of the impact of the horse's weight and speed, which can get up to 88 kilometers per hour. The hoof's hard outer shell offers excellent protection for the softer, more sensitive inner hoof, which helps pump blood into the leg and maintains circulation. Their name in Latin means \"one hundred legs.\" But despite their name, centipedes can have varying numbers of legs, ranging from 30 to 354. Centipedes are members of an invertebrate class called Arthropods. They can be found on almost every continent except Antarctica. Their numerous feet help them orientate themselves in dark areas (like antennas), so they can avoid getting stuck in tight spaces. Penguins don't get cold feet. Like other birds, they have a fine grid of blood vessels that act as a countercurrent heat-exchanger to keep their feet warm. Their little webbed feet transform into fins when swimming, stiff as a board and powered by their strong muscles. Combined with the perfect torpedo-like shape of the penguin, they propel it underwater to between 10 and 20 kilometers per hour.

{"id": null, "body": "     Stopping mass species extinction is possible if the world pulls together, says leading ecologist Gerardo Ceballos in an interview with DW. Almost 40% of plants are at risk of extinction, scientists have warned.\u00a0 \u00a0A global report\u00a0 published on Wednesday by Britain's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said\u00a0land clearing, over-harvesting of wild species\u00a0and changing weather patterns all posed significant threats. Of the almost\u00a04,000 new\u00a0species of plant and fungi botanists registered last year,\u00a0many were\u00a0already facing extinction.\u00a0Researchers said they were now in a \"race against time\" to catalogue unknown species\u00a0before they disappeared for good.\u00a0 Ecologist and conservationist Gerardo Ceballos is\u00a0the founder of the Stop Extinction campaign, which aims to raise awareness about species loss . He co-authored\u00a0a seminal 2015 paper defining what has become known as the sixth mass extinction. That paper has recently been updated. DW: What is this sixth mass extinction all about? Gerardo Ceballos: In the past, there has been what we call five mass extinctions. Those mass extinctions are basically of a catastrophic nature. They have caused the destruction of around 70%\u00a0of all the animals and plants on the planet. And we call them mass extinctions because they're much, much higher than the normal background extinction. Gerardo Ceballos says the rate of extinction will double unless we do something to stop it We found that species of vertebrates, mammals, birds, reptiles and\u00a0amphibians that have become extinct \u00a0in the last 100 years, would have taken 10,000 years to become extinct under the normal background extinction rates. In other words, in 100 years, we have lost species that would normally have taken 10,000 years to lose.\u00a0In one year, we lost the species we would have lost in 100 years. That's the magnitude of the problem. So we conclude that we have entered the sixth mass extinction. And in this case, the sixth mass extinction is caused by humans. W hat is actually driving that extinction? What are we doing that's causing species to go extinct? The ultimate causes are basically three things: Human population , consumption and the use of faulty technologies like fossil fuels. Things that are more easily tracked, and that we can change are habitat destruction and the illegal trade, which is this gigantic enterprise run by international mafias \u2014\u00a0in Mexico, the US, Europe, China \u2014\u00a0that make a gigantic profit by exploiting species. This, plus things like\u00a0 air pollution , invasive species, and now global warming is causing this mass die-off of populations and species. And what is very important to emphasize is that this sixth mass extinction is accelerating and unless we do something, the rate of extinction will double. Orangutans and snow leopards are considered to be among the most endangered species in the world Why should people be concerned about species dying out at accelerated rates? If we are very selfish and we want to keep humanity and civilization on Earth, we need to care for the wild plants and animals because they are part of the machinery that keeps conditions on Earth able to support life. All the benefits that we get from well-functioning nature and the proper combination of atmospheric gases to sustain life on Earth, depend on wild plants and animals. We have 15 years only, we think, to change the course of the extinction path. The survival of all living things on this planet, including humans, will depend\u00a0on what we do. What needs to happen to get a handle on this crisis? We need to think globally. We need to act together to fight the illegal trade. We probably need to create or strengthen new parts of the United Nations. Next year, there is a big biodiversity conservation conference in China and one of the main points now is how do we stop the illegal trade. The second thing will be that we need to really find ways to reduce inequity between countries and within countries. And finally, we need to work and understand that destroying the environment is an existential threat. We are proposing a new strategy called Stop Extinction. Everybody knows now about climate change and its impact . Nobody basically knows about the magnitude of the extinction crisis and its impact. So what we need now is a massive campaign that tells us, every day: This is an existential threat . On the one hand it is really bad, but on the other hand, it can be solved. There are many success stories in conservation. What we need to do first is to have a massive campaign of understanding, making people, corporations and countries aware of the problem, but also empower them to know that this gigantic challenge can be solved and we can all be part of that. Speices of marine animals, marsupials, insects, birds, plants, flowers and trees are all facing the threat of extinction The Convention on Biological Diversity is this very important international tool to conserve biodiversity. And there was this biodiversity plan that went through 2020. What do you think it needs to look like looking forward from 2020? There are three things we need to do. One, we need to change the rules for wildlife trade. We need to stop the illegal trade and we need a massive effort to do it. We need to increase the number of protected areas throughout the world and find incentives to maintain all the natural habitats still left that are not protected. I think the world needs to invest probably $50 billion or $100 billion (\u20ac43\u00a0billion or \u20ac85 billion) a year specifically on these issues, on how to protect biodiversity. What you're describing sounds almost like a Paris Agreement for species. It is different to the Paris Agreement because we don't need to change the economy of the world to do it. And by doing it, we can create a lot of wealth. We know what to do. We just need to have the rules and the incentive to do it properly. This has to be like the Paris Agreement for biodiversity - but let's understand that if we lose all these species and the whole full range of climate change unravels on Earth, there is no way we will survive. This interview was conducted by Sonya Diehn for DW's Living Planet and has been edited and condensed for clarity. Only two living spiny seahorses have been sighted since 2015 in prime breeding waters on southern England's Dorset coast. But a remarkable recovery is underway thanks to the COVID-19 lockdown, with 16 seahorses recently observed during a single dive by the Seahorse Trust. \"When humans leave nature alone it has a chance to recover, and indeed thrive,\" Trust founder Neil Garrick-Maidment told DW. This marine mollusc entered the Red List as Critically Endangered in December. A newly discovered pathogen is causing dramatic declines in the population throughout the Mediterranean Sea, where the mollusc is endemic. The IUCN says that 80 to 100% of Fan Mussels affected by the pathogen have died, which \"amounts to a mass mortality event.\" The Kenyan primate species is now Critically Endangered due to dramatic forest habitat loss caused by flooding, agriculture, fire, selective logging and wood collection. One of the world's 25 most threatened primates, its remaining forests are small and have a precarious future. Hunting is also helping to drive red colobus numbers down. Africa's Black Rhino population has grown at an annual rate of 2.5% between 2012 and 2018, from an estimated 4,845 to 5,630 animals in the wild. Though the Black Rhino remains Critically Endangered, the slow recovery is \"a powerful reminder...that conservation works,\" said Grethel Aguilar, IUCN Acting Director General. But poaching and illegal trade could still undo the hard work, he warned. A Red List update reveals that 37% of Australia\u2019s freshwater fish species are threatened with extinction. Nearly 60% are directly impacted by the climate crisis, the fish struggling to survive ongoing extreme droughts linked to record low rainfall and historical high temperatures. Invasive introduced species are also colonizing fresh water habitats due to shifting water temperatures and flows. The flightless Guam Rail is, after the California Condor, the second bird in history to recover after being declared extinct in the Wild. Native to the Pacific island of Guam, it was wiped out by the Brown Tree Snake after it was introduced in the mid-1940s. Still Critically Endangered, a 35-year captive breeding programme helped establish a Guam Rail population on the neighbouring Cocos Island. The world's largest pseudoscorpion has entered the Red List as critically endangered. Reaching 1.5 cm, the oversized mini-beast with scorpion heritage lives exclusively on a 5-hectare islet off the arid Ascension Island located in the Atlantic between Africa and Brazil. The Giant Pseudoscorpion is losing habitat to introduced \"predatory invertebrates\" such as the American Cockroach. While European Rabbits have been widely introduced across the Continent, the species has moved from near threatened to endangered across its original habitat in Spain, Portugal and southern France. Key prey to the endangered Iberian Lynx and the vulnerable Spanish Imperial Eagle, a new outbreak of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease is responsible for an estimated 70% population decline. While 812 of 826 eucalypt tree species occur only in Australia, an unprecedented worldwide assessment of the genus tree was included in the latest Red List update. Near 25% of the species that covers much of the Australian continent are threatened with extinction, due largely to habitat loss. These include the Vulnerable Eucalyptus moluccana, the sole food source of the declining Koala. Since the Tasmanian tiger was hunted to extinction a century ago, around 500 vertebrates have been lost for ever. According to a research team including Paul Ehrlich \u2014 who in 2015 confirmed a human-induced sixth extinction was underway \u2014 515 vertebrates now have fewer than 1,000 individuals, and could be extinct within 20 years. Climate change and the animal trade are driving the acceleration.

In the face of climate denial, the link to global heating must be unambiguous.\u00a0\u00a0 \"These are not just wildfires, they are climate fires,\" Jay Inslee, Governor of Washington State, said as he stood amid the charred remains of the town of Malden west of Seattle earlier this month. \"This is not an act of God,\" he added. \"This has happened because we have changed the climate of the state of Washington in dramatic ways.\" As megafires devastated the entire West Coast of the US, Inslee rejected reference to wildfires since the word implies naturally occurring fires. By contrast, the term climate fires explicitly links\u00a0record-breaking blazes that have burned across California, Oregon and Washington to\u00a0global heating caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas.\u00a0 As California Governor Gavin Newsom inspected the ashen countryside in the county of Oroville in his home state, he doubled down on the source of the fires. \"This is a climate damn emergency,\" he said. The pointed link to climate has been partly a response to President\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s insistence \u00a0that poor forest management, not climate change,\u00a0is to blame for the fires. Meanwhile,\u00a0 research shows barely 13% of broadcast news segments about the West Coast fires during their peak mentioned climate change. Sam Ricketts, who led climate policy and strategy for Governor Jay Inslee's 2020 presidential campaign, tweeted on September 11 that \"These aren't wildfires. These are #climatefires, driven by fossil fuel pollution.\" \"The rate and the strength and the devastation wrought by these disasters are fuelled by climate change,\" Ricketts told DW of fires that have burnt well over 5 million acres (2.02 million hectares) across California, Oregon, Washington State, and into neighboring Idaho.\u00a0\u00a0 In a two-day period in early September, Ricketts notes that more of Washington State burned than in almost any entire fire season until now, apart from 2015.\u00a0 California, meanwhile, was a tinderbox after its hottest summer on record, with temperatures in Death Valley reaching nearly 55 degrees Celsius (130 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the US National Weather Service. It has been reported as the hottest temperature ever measured on Earth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As evidenced by Australia's apocalyptic Black Summer of 2019-2020, fires are burning bigger and for longer, with new records set year-on-year. Right now, Brazil's vast and highly biodiverse Pantanal wetlands are suffering from catastrophic fires. Governor Inslee this month invoked the phrase climate fires for arguably the first time in the US, according to Ricketts. But the term was also used as fires burnt out of control in Australia in late 2019. In the face of a 2000km fire front, and government officials and media who played down the link to climate change , Greens Party Senator Sarah Hanson-Young and a friend decided that reference to bushfires was inadequate.\u00a0 \"We both just said, we've got to start calling them climate fires, that's what they are,\" the Australian Senator told DW.\u00a0\u00a0 A line of fire such that which swept over vast areas of Australia earlier this year Hanson-Young says scientists have been warning for decades that these would be the effects of global heating. \"We've been told these kinds of extreme weather events and destruction is what climate change would look like, and it's right here on our doorstep,\" she said from her home state of South Australia \u2014 where by early September fire warnings had already been issued. \"Calling them climate fires was making it absolutely crystal clear. It is essential that there's no ambiguity,\" she said\u00a0 Having deliberately invoked the term, Hanson-Young soon started to push it on social media via a #climatefires hashtag.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The need to use more explicit language when talking about extreme weather events linked to climate change is part of a broader push to express the urgency of global heating. In 2019, activist Greta Thunberg tweeted\u00a0that the term \"climate change\" did not reflect the seriousness of the situation.\u00a0 \"Can we all now please stop saying 'climate change' and instead call it what it is: climate breakdown, climate crisis, climate emergency, ecological breakdown, ecological crisis and ecological emergency?\" she wrote.\u00a0 \"Climate change has for a long time been talked about as something that is a danger in the future,\" said Hansen-Young. \"But the consequences are already here. When people hear the word crisis, they understand that something has to happen, that action has to be taken.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The sky above San Francisco rendered orange from the fires raging across the West coast of the US Some terms are now used in\u00a0public policy, with state and national governments, and indeed the EU Parliament, declaring an official climate emergency in the last year.\u00a0\u00a0 Read more :\u00a0 Wildfires: Can we adapt to live with them? But while the West Coast governors all fervently link the fires to an unfolding climate crisis, US President Donald Trump continues to avoid any reference to climate. In a briefing about the fires, he responded to overtures by Wade Crowfoot, California's Natural Resources Secretary, to work with the states on the climate crisis by stating: \"It'll start getting cooler. You just watch.\" Crowfoot replied by saying that scientists disagreed. Trump rejoined with \"I don't think science knows, actually.\"\u00a0 It was reminiscent of the anti-science approach to the coronavirus pandemic within the Trump administration, at least publicly . Fossil fuel companies are also benefiting from his disavowal of climate science, with the Trump administration having pulled out of the Paris Agreement and reopened fossil fuel infrastructure like the Keystone XL pipeline.\u00a0 But the science community has responded, with Scientific American magazine endorsing Trump's Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden, the first presidential endorsement in its 175-year history.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hanson-Young says the use of explicit language like climate fires has also been important in Australia due to the climate denialism of politicians and the press, especially in publications owned by Rupert Murdoch. As fires burnt out much of Australia's southeast coast, they were commonly blamed on arson \u2014 a tactic also recently used in the US. President Trump rejects the science during a briefing on wildfires on September 14 The language of climate has begun to influence\u00a0the US presidential election campaign, with Democratic nominee Joe Biden labelling President Trump a \"climate arsonist.\"\u00a0 Biden is touting a robust climate plan that includes a 2050 zero emissions target\u00a0and a return to the Paris Agreement. Though lacking the ambition of The New Green Deal, it has been front and center of his policy platform in recent days, at a time when five hurricanes are battering the US Gulf Coast while smoke blanketing\u00a0the West Coast spreads all the way to the East.\u00a0\u00a0 People are experiencing the climate crisis in a visceral way and almost universally relate to the language of an emergency, says Ricketts. \"They know something is wrong.\" Massive bushfires\u00a0have devastated Australia as the blazes continue to rage across the country. Since the start of one of the worst fire seasons on record, more than 2,500\u00a0homes have been burned, tens of thousands of people evacuated, and at least 29 killed. Here, a photographer reacts to seeing the burnt-out remains of a relative's home in Quaama, New South Wales. As of January 17, fires have burnt roughly 10 million hectares (25 million acres) of land, an area larger than South Korea or Portugal. More than 170 fires continue to burn in Victoria state and New South Wales. There were 82 fires burning across New South Wales, 30 uncontained, and several fires in Victoria, according to fire authorities. Firefighters protect homes around Charmhaven, New South Wales, on December 30. Wildfires burning across four Australian states that day destroyed hundreds of properties and caused multiple fatalities. A volunteer firefighter was killed and three others were injured after strong winds pushed a fire truck over. A person stands in protective gear as nearby bushfires turn the sky red in Mallacoota, Victoria. Thousands of people in the coastal region were told to evacuate over the New Year period, while the Country Fire Authority later issued an ominous warning to residents still in the area that it was \"too late to leave.\" Some 4,000 people spent New Year's Eve on the beach to avoid the flames. An air tanker drops fire retardant over the Gospers Mountain fire near Colo Heights, northwest of Sydney, Australia on November 15, 2019. The Gospers Mountain fire originated in the Wollemi National Park, and came close to merging with other major fires in the area. Fires have torn apart the Blue Mountains, a popular tourist area, burning more than 500,000 hectares of land. A burnt bicycle lies on the ground in front of a house destroyed by bushfires on the outskirts of the town of Bargo, near Sydney, on December 21, 2019. The town was hit with a catastrophic fire danger warning as fires turned several nearby homes to ashes. The New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian declared a state of emergency that same week. Firefighters are among the 28 people who have lost their lives in the fires. Some were volunteers. Thirty-two-year-old Geoffrey Keaton, along with a colleague, died when a burnt tree fell in the path of their fire truck. Keaton's nineteen-month-old son Harvey was awarded one of the service's highest honors on behalf of his father on January 2. A kangaroo that survived the bushfire in Wollemi National Park in Sydney grazes for food in November 2019. The fires have not only sparked concern over human well-being, but have also created worries over the survival of endangered and vulnerable animals. The fires have killed more than a billion animals across eastern and southern Australia. The Insurance Council of Australia said on January 7 that the bushfires have caused at least US$485 million (\u20ac435 million) in damage and that number was likely to rise. Separately, authorities warned of looters in towns where people have evacuated and scammers taking advantage of fundraisers for relief efforts. The bushfires have devastated Australia's koala population. In New South Wales state alone, officials estimate 30% of koala habitat - eucalpyt woodlands, which they use for both food and shelter - may have been lost. At least 45 koalas were being treated for burns at the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital. Thousands of people took to the streets on January 10 in Australia's major cities to rally against Prime Minister Scott Morrison's inaction on climate change and his handling of the ongoing bushfire crises. The nationwide rallies were organized by university students in Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart. Smoke from Australia drifted across the Pacific and reached South America, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on January 7. On January 2, the EU Copernicus program recorded the highest concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide in the world over the \"clean\" South Pacific Ocean stemming from the fires in Australia. The wildfires ravaging America's West Coast have sent thousands fleeing and will leave behind destruction, uncertainty and huge bills. The disruption to the economy should not be underestimated. \u00a0 A new survey has found that 3 billion animals were impacted by Australia's recent devastating bushfire season, with reptiles hardest hit. Conservationists say it's \"one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history.\"\n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "'Wildfires are climate fires': How to talk about climate emergency, global heating", "article_name": "climate-fire-us-california-australia-wildfire-climate-emergency-gavin-newsom", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-fire-us-california-australia-wildfire-climate-emergency-gavin-newsom/a-54979516", "date_published": "2020-09-21 00:00:00", "article_length": 11780, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:02:10.745598"}
{"id": null, "body": "     In rural Bolivia, making a sustainable living is becoming difficult for smallholders. But the country's women, who are traditionally responsible of farming, are demonstrating resilience to the effects of climate change. Nestled in Bolivia's Cochabamba valley is the village of Tiraque. One of dozens of indigenous farming communities in the traditionally fertile local region, it sits at an altitude of 3,300 meters (10,800 feet). There, families live as they have for generations: from what they can cultivate. That has traditionally been potatoes, but changing weather patterns bring a need to adapt and think beyond habit. Particularly for women. The consequences of climate change are not evenly distributed \u2014 the poor are hit harder than the rich. Furthermore, gender plays a role: women are more vulnerable, as they are the ones responsible for production and preparation of food. This is especially the case in rural areas, where making a sustainable living is depends directly on agricultural production. Teresa Hosse is representative of the Bolivian Platform against Climate Change. She says the South American country's unique composition of highland (Altiplano), valley and Amazon makes it among those worst-affected by the consequences of global warming. Juanita Terrazas (pictured above), who is now 23 years old, remembers a time when it was \"so cold that only potatoes could grow here.\" Carrying a plastic container of ecological herbicides on her back, she sprays the cauliflowers she has now been growing for the last three years. \"The sun is coming closer, so it is much warmer than before, and that brings new plagues to our fields,\" she says in reference to the tiny red spiders and aphids that wreak havoc. Although they may not understand the exact mechanics of global warming, women in Tiraque are well aware of how the climate is changing. The average temperature, they say, is rising; the rainy season has shortened from four to two months; communities are being hit by drought; and the weather is less predictable, bringing more extremes such as floods and hailstorms. Read more:\u00a0 Climate change and extreme weather: Science is proving the link They have different explanations for these shifting weather patterns. One woman says Pachamama, or Mother Earth, is tired of producing; another believes the sun coming through the hole in the ozone layer is so strong that it vaporizes the rain before it can hit the earth. Other women hold cars, asphalt and factories outside Bolivia responsible. As it is no longer possible to produce the same quantity and quality of potatoes as before, farmers need to try out other crops such as onions and beans.\u00a0 Luckily, water is still available in wells on the mountains with irrigation canals either dug by hand, or more effectively using plastic tubes leading to their fields.  Although learning about food diversification has the advantage of giving the women the chance to grow, sell and eat a wider range of vegetables, Juanita's neighbor Nicola Monta\u00f1a (pictured above planting) says they did not make this choice freely. Rather, they were forced to take action now that their potatoes no longer grow to a decent size. \"We learn by trial and error. And it is much more work because we have to sow all the onions by hand instead of using bulls,\" as is the case with potatoes. \"I am 64, and my back is hurting.\" The Bolivian Institute for Empowerment of Farmer Communities (INCCA) is teaching the communities to use ecological fertilizers to help in the fight against climate change and secure a decent yield.  Livestock is also a feature of life in the Cochabamba valley. Cows provide milk, chicken lay eggs and sheep are kept for their wool. Occasionally an animal is slaughtered so the family has meat to eat or sell. The women are the ones who take care of the animals, and it is also their role to slaughter or sell them. Primavera Besara's granddaughter stands with a calf she bought in a neighboring village. \"We will feed it the clover from our fields,\" Primavera says. \"In half a year, during the dry season, I will sell the cow for six times the price.\" She describes the animal as her \"personal investment.\"  Trinidad Coss\u00edo (pictured above) also has a cow. This was given to her when she became a member of a native women's farming syndicate, the Bartolina Sisa Confederation of Campesino, Indigenous and Native Women in Bolivia, which is the leading union organization for peasant women in the country. \"If it delivers a calf, I have to donate it to another Bartolina, so everyone will benefit.\" Women involved in the union have greater economic independence through funding targeted at improving their situation, and have become more organized. Trinidad, who became a Bartolina some eight years ago, says her main reason for doing so was because she heard there was funding available. But she was also motivated by a desire to speak in public, to learn how to make decisions and to value women's voices.  In traditional gender roles,\u00a0 men are responsible for providing an income while women take care of the children. Nowadays, women also run their own businesses, such as chicherias, where they brew and sell chicha, an alcoholic beverage brewed from fermented maize. Or they make an additional income by slaughtering chickens and preparing food to sell at the local market on fridays.  Teresa Hosse, of the Bolivian Platform against Climate Change, says women are more affected by climate change. \"Men migrate to the cities for other work, while the women stay behind with the double burden of taking care of their children, and their fields and their livestock.\" Under Bolivia's President Evo Morales, several steps have been taken for greater gender equality, including passage of a 2005 law that calls for at least 50 percent female representation in local government. But more money has also been made available for organizations and projects such as the INCAA leadership training program that empowers women to make their own decisions and become more independent from men.  INCCA also runs a program on gender education in the communities around Tiraque village. Municipal Councilor Miriam Coss\u00edo (pictured above, left) says INCCA taught her that her voice counts, and how to discuss her opinions with men. \"It is not only the women that have to change,\" she says \"Men are also learning to respect and listen to us. The mentality in the communities is slowly changing.\" It might be a plodding process, but Juanita \u2014 who remembers fields of potatoes from her earlier years \u2014 says life in the community has evolved. \"We are becoming more independent and we are in a process of empowerment. Climate change is making us stronger.\" \u00a0 Some 10,500 firefighters were called to tackle forest fires in California in 2015. They were unable to prevent 1,400 homes from destruction. The blaze was fueled by hot and dry weather - as a result of climate change. The polar bear has become a symbol of climate change, as its habitat is threatened by global warming. The Arctic predator hunts from ice sheets that are fast disappearing. As the ice retreats, they are unable to stalk their prey, and risk starvation. By 2050, scientists warn that the Arctic could be ice-free in summer. Just visible from the air is a little wood hut on the island of Spitzbergen in Norway. It is home to the Arctic research base where French and German scientists are studying climatic and atmospheric changes in the polar region, including the damage done to permafrost and glacier systems. A goat watches a mountain expedition on the Swiss Aletsch Glacier, a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was around a kilometer longer in 1860 than it is today. Due to global warming, the glacier is shrinking by up to 50 meters per year. With the rate of retreat increasing, scientists fear Europe's biggest glacier could disappear altogether. \u2026 the landscape looks peaceful, bathed in a mystical light. But the actual situation is far more unsettling. This aerial view shows Central Luzon in the Philippines, completely flooded after it was hit by a typhoon and heavy rain. People were drowned or buried under landslides, and half a million were forced to flee their homes. The country is hit by 20 typhoons each year. \u2026 escape is all that's left. The World Bank warns that if global warming continues unimpeded, another 100 million people will be under threat. Poor people in parts of Africa and South Asia are at particular risk. Drought and flooding threaten crops - leading to hunger, disease and high food prices. Climate change often hits children the hardest, through no fault of their own. Studies have found that economic problems exacerbated by drought can have profound social impacts, such as in an increase in child marriages, for example. Families may marry off their underage daughters earlier to have fewer mouths they have to feed. Elephants produce huge quantities of manure. At Munich's Hellabrunn Zoo in Germany, one local utility is turning their waste into electric power. Around 2,000 tons of biowaste provides enough power for a hundred homes. Could this be a model for an African school? In any case, climate change is forcing new ways of thinking in the search for green energy. The Rhine River is Europe's busiest waterway for shipping - but climate change is affecting business. Ongoing drought means shipping firms would be forced to use shorter vessels that can navigate shallower waters. If ships aren't able to set off, more goods have to be transported by road - which is more expensive. Healthy coral reefs are like a blooming garden. But global warming is bleaching the life out of them. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae, which are vital to their health. But as the water heats up, they expel the algae. If warmer water temperatures persist, a lack of nutrients calcifies the corals, which makes their color fade and causes the organisms to die. Global warming also has its benefits. In recent years, wine is being produced on Germany's northernmost island, Sylt. Ever more vineyards are being established at higher altitudes and further north - even Scandinavia now has some. Global warming also means earlier harvests and sweeter grapes. Author: Karin J\u00e4ger / rr, ng Nowhere will suffer more from climate change than Africa.

{"id": null, "body": "     In many parts of the world, droughts are getting longer, more intense and more frequent. Alex Jones, climate and environment director at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, tells DW about the risk to food security. DW:\u00a0 So we're facing this global heat wave and it's impacting farmers. How are they coping? Alex Jones: It's very hard for farmers to cope once you're midway through a [farming] cycle, especially if you're on a long cycle crop like cereals. If you planted wheat or maize, once it's in the ground there's absolutely nothing you could do except maybe irrigate a bit more. But even that's not going to reduce the wilt. It's more about having better information, putting in seeds that are more resilient. And especially about spreading your risk, and not focusing exclusively on one crop, but multi-cropping. And increasing biodiversity in the field, so that there are different crops, and you hedge your risk against total failure. Monculture cropping suffers under extreme conditions Could drought cause food shortages and famines in the years or decades to come, and what regions are most at risk? Absolutely, yes it can of course cause famines. The FAO estimate is that we have 830 million people who are currently food-insecure. They do not have enough food to eat, without this kind of shortage. We also know that we produce more than enough food in the world to feed everybody. But there are redistribution problems, and about one-third of all food is lost at the transformation stage. So there is a lot of slack to be picked up there; but obviously, decreasing production could be a major factor. We're also looking at the issue of nutrient depletion . Climate change,\u00a0CO2 changes in the air, are\u00a0having an impact on the nutrient content of food. Some cereals have about 10 percent less protein, and they have less minerals and less vitamins. So it's not just a question of how much food, but also the quality of that food. Is drought going to become the new normal for farmers? Unfortunately, variability is going to become the new normal. So too much rain one year, drought the next year, freezing temperatures the next year, and then a really good year the next. That's the biggest problem. If we had a constant trend or we knew that the temperature was going to go up by 2 degrees and stay there, we could deal with that, 2 degrees is manageable. The problem is variability. Extreme weather events \u008d\u2014 cyclones, hurricanes, rainfall, hail fall, high temperatures in August in northern Europe. The unpredictability is the hardest element, and it seems that unpredictability is here to stay. The solutions are within our reach. But why aren't they being tapped into? Well they're expensive, and farmers are already often very stressed in terms of barely making a profit. And of course in a year like this, where they're probably going to lose money because of the drought, if we were to come in and say: \"Well, we want you to invest more money in limited tillage or zero-tillage equipment,\" of course they're going to say, \"You're crazy, I'm already in debt.\" In northeastern Germany, there has been hardly any rainfall in recent months. The country's weather service says Saxony-Anhalt received just 15 liters of rainfall per square meter \u2014 roughly a quarter of the average. Across Germany, there were just 50 liters of rainfall per square meter, half of the usual amount. Mecklenburg-West Pomerania received more sunshine than any other German state. The little rain that fell came down very unevenly across Germany. In May, the country's weather service warned of potential forest fires in parts of Lower Saxony. Meanwhile in southwestern Germany, some towns faced torrential rains that flooded cellars and roads, such as here in Fischbach, Rhineland-Palatinate. The danger of forest fires is extremely high right now throughout the country. The state of Brandenburg faces the biggest threat. In recent weeks, authorities have been forced to put out more than 100 fires. Recently, 100 hectares of forest and wheat crops burned to the ground in the Oder-Spree region. Brandenburg authorities reported that 90 percent of fires are inadvertently caused by humans. It took 40 firefighters 13 hours to extinguish the flames sweeping through Brandenburg's Oder-Spree region. A fire in Rostock, meanwhile, was not caused by humans \u2014 but by a bird. Police say the animal caused an electricity cable to short circuit, which then set a nearby field ablaze. Saxony-Anhalt's firefighters, meanwhile, are so busy they needed to get creative to find new sources of water. So they headed to a nearby pool to refill their tanks. The dryness, meanwhile, not only makes fires more likely but also poses a major threat to farmers. The unusually dry weather has forced many farmers to harvest their crops early. The German Farmers' Association has stated that even April was too warm and dry. The following months meant wheat crops ripened much faster than expected, though insufficient rain has produced a low yield. Sudden torrential rainfall, meanwhile, made matters worse by destroying parts of the crops. Potatoes, sugar cane and corn are usually harvested in autumn. They require much more water than wheat and rapeseed. So due to the unusually dry weather, Germany's corn plants are in bad shape. The German Farmers' Association president, Joachim Rukwied, is pessimistic and fears crop failures could jeopardize the livelihoods of many farmers. There are two kind of drought: \"Drought in a meteorological sense refers to a drop in rainfall within one month below the long-term average,\" says Stephan Tober of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research. This causes a drought in the agricultural sense, meaning that there is too little water in the ground. That's a problem for wheat and meadows on the banks of river Elbe here in Dresden. \"Extreme dry spells can cause long-term damage to trees and recovery takes a long time,\" says Ingolf K\u00fchn of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research. Vegetation has a memory, so to speak, and may adapt if there are several consecutive years with little rainfall. Some German cities have now called on residents to help out in watering trees, so that some day, cacti will not replace trees. The Rhine River and its tributaries have lowered to dangerous levels, leading to\u00a0restrictions in shipping. The Mannheim office of the federal Waterway and Shipping Department confirmed that, until conditions change, ships in the upper Rhine can only be loaded with 1500 tons of cargo, down from their usual weight of 3000 or more. Author: Julia Vergin It's about finding the collective will, and making sure that everybody is on a level playing field, because of course if the farmers in Germany do this but their neighbors in another country don't, then they'll be at a competitive risk. We all need to agree on certain standards so that it's a level playing field and we can make these investments. Farmers in some regions of Germany are facing crop losses of up to a quarter. Most are able to draw from insurance schemes to help cover these losses. But how can insurance work when the losses occur year after year, as might start happening? Insurance premiums will go up. That's the basic functioning of insurance: The higher the risk, the higher the premiums. So the question at some point is, will farmers be able to afford insurance? Will it be worth their while if the premiums are so high? And that's a major concern, because some of that is underwritten by government support as well. So we might see an insurance systems fail\u00a0if they're unable to cope. And of course, we're very concerned about all the nascent crop insurance schemes that we're trying to help support in developing countries because they very much need these. Farms in northern Germany have been wracked by drought this summer Did the Paris Agreement include the agricultural sector? Unfortunately not. The Paris Agreement did not mention agriculture. However, since then there's been huge progress. There was a big discussion at the COP22 called the Marrakesh Partnership which agreed to come up with an agricultural component. And at the COP23 last year in Bonn, there was what is called the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture, which is an agreement that all the parties to COP will work together for two years on five focus areas in agriculture, and come up with standards to be included in the Paris Agreement on agriculture. So there are things in the works, but the world just needs to come together to coagulate on it?\u00a0 What we need is to speed it up because we don't have two decades to work on this. We really need to get results within a few years. Otherwise it will be too late. Alex Jones is director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Climate and Environment Division. The interview was conducted by Sonya Diehn, and has been edited for length and clarity. The challenge of feeding a planet that\u2019s set to have 3 billion more people on it by 2050 - made even more acute by climate change as some parts of the planet become wetter, while others drier - means the pressure is on to find ways to feed the planet. So farming has to become more productive \u2013 and new areas to grow, especially in dry climates, must be found. One potential solution: hydroponics. Farming with little space and producing higher crop yields: hydroponics fits the bill. Though it may sound like something out of Star Trek, it's actually been around since the Aztecs \u2013 they built floating farms around the city of Tenochtitlan. Hydroponics essentially means growing plants without soil, and instead using a nutrient-rich solution to supply them with water and minerals. With hydroponics, plants \u2013 usually supported by soil \u2013 are propped up artificially instead, and a nutrient solution is applied to the suspended roots using a number of different methods, including spraying them with a solution mist. Together with artificial lights, heaters and other equipment, the nutrient solutions help plants develop faster, produce larger yields and grow all year round. Hydroponics can recycle water, meaning it could use as little as 10 percent of the water a conventional farm uses \u2013 making it an option in arid environments. And the closed system means nutrients don't escape, cutting fertilizer down to as much as a quarter of what a conventional farm would use. Also, almost no pesticide is needed, since soil pests aren't an issue for plants grown without soil. When growing sideways isn't an option, try going upwards: hydroponic growing trays can be piled on top of one another, and plants can be grown more closely next to each than in the soil, making it very efficient in terms of space. As for what kind of space they can grow in, the sky is the limit: with no need for scarce farmland, one possibility could be to have hydroponic farms in skyscrapers. Running a hydroponic farm can be complex, energy-intensive and expensive. Plants require many essential nutrients, and the farm needs a large amount of equipment. Heat and light, supplied for free by the sun in conventional farms, have to be provided artifically and paid for. And power failures could mean whole crops are destroyed if they go too long without water and light. Hydroponics can theoretically be used to grow any crop, although the technique lends itself best to plants such as cucumbers, salad greens, tomatoes, peppers and herbs. Given its long history, hydroponics still isn't widely used. But that looks set to change: the global hydroponic farming industry was estimated to be worth $21.2 billion in 2016. That's forecast to grow by 7 per cent each year. Author: Melanie Hall In Germany, some like it hot \u2014 this summer's unusually hot, sunny weather, that is.

{"id": null, "body": "     China currently releases more carbon emissions than any other country \u2014 leading many to believe it bears the greatest responsibility for climate change. However, the situation is more complex than it seems. The accusations keep cropping up when it comes to the debate around climate change: \"China is the biggest destroyer of the planet,\" \"China is the worst country in terms of pollution,\" \"China is to blame.\" But what role does China actually play in climate change? Since 2008, China has topped\u00a0the annual list of being the largest emitters of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide\u00a0(CO2),\u00a0according to Our World in Data , an online scientific publication that Oxford University contributes to. In 2019, China emitted 10.2 billion metric tons of CO2 \u2014 nearly twice as much as the United States (5.3 billion metric tons) \u2014 representing nearly 28% of global emissions. But net emissions alone are not enough to blame China for climate change. \"If you look at only one number, you're only getting one side of the story,\" says Shyla Raghav, vice president of climate change at Conservation International, an environmental organization headquartered in the United States. To get more insight, it's worth looking at carbon dioxide emissions per capita. When combining 2019 data from the Global Carbon Project and\u00a0Our World in Data, numerous states from the Caribbean\u00a0and the Persian Gulf\u00a0top the list. In 14th place is the US, with just over 16 tons of CO2 per capita. China emits less than half of that per capita, tallying 7.1 tons, putting the country\u00a0in 48th place. In the case of carbon dioxide, it is important to know that from a human perspective, the gas can remain in the atmosphere for an extremely long time : The entire decomposition process takes several hundred thousand years, according to the federal German Environment Agency . Oceans and forests can absorb some of the gas quite quickly \u2014 but an estimated\u00a040% of the CO2 emitted by humans since 1850 has remained in the atmosphere, according to the international study Global Carbon Budget .\u00a0 When examining what drives human-caused climate change, historical emissions must be considered. The data shows that \u00a0although China is the second-largest emitter of carbon emissions as of 2019,\u00a0it has emitted 220 billion metric tons of CO2 since 1750\u00a0\u2014 just over half as much as the US, which released 410 billion metric tons. Germany's historical emissions total 92 billion metric tons, putting it in fourth place behind Russia and ahead of the UK. Robbie Andrew, a senior researcher\u00a0at the Center for International Climate Research (CICERO) in Norway,\u00a0said China began producing significant amounts of CO2 much later when compared to its historical emissions. \"China's emissions really weren't significant. They didn't start ramping up until about 2001 when China joined the World Trade Organization, and that gave it access to the world's markets and that drove their economic boom, particularly focused on producing goods for exports,\" said Andrew, who also participated in the\u00a0Global Carbon Budget study.\u00a0 \"There was already a problem before China came along. So, effectively,\u00a0China did not create the problem.\" There is one other point that\u00a0plays a role when considering\u00a0the question of climate change responsibility.\u00a0 How many items do you own that bear the label \"Made in China\"?\u00a0Items could include your\u00a0smartphone, cutlery, a plastic chair or even your\u00a0laptop. The greenhouse gases emitted during the product's manufacturing are tallied as China's \u2014 and not\u00a0the\u00a0country where you purchase\u00a0and use it.\u00a0Statistics on carbon emissions\u00a0are usually recorded according to the producer principle, and\u00a0not the consumer principle. One feature of globalization is that countries in the Global North, in particular, have outsourced their production operations. When you take that into account, the picture shifts. For example, under the consumer principle, the carbon footprint of the US in 2018 was around 6.3% higher\u00a0 than under the producer principle , while in Germany it was 14% more. Countries ranked highest under the consumer principle were Malta and Switzerland, with footprints\u00a0248% and 225% higher, respectively. China, on the other hand, is a CO2 exporter. If the statistics are adjusted for emissions for products that go abroad, Chinese CO2 balance drops by 10%. As CICERO researcher Andrew explains, this effect was even greater for China around 15 years ago. In the mid-2000s, export goods were responsible for about one-fifth of China's emissions. But Andrew expects further changes\u00a0for China in the future. \"This effect is going to continue to decline because the share of China's economy that's focused on exports\u00a0is declining as a share of the total,\" he said.\u00a0 Earlier this year, three scientists from Dutch and German research institutes proposed introducing a concept whereby responsibility for CO2 emissions should be shared between consumers and producers according to economic benefit. Other factors relating to globalization should also be considered. International shipping and air traffic don't usually show up in statistics for individual countries , but rather are listed separately. This means\u00a0transporting your laptop won't affect the CO2 budget of either China or your country. So when we talk about responsibility for climate change, the nation-state's impact can't be the only\u00a0benchmark used:\u00a0Transportation also has a significant share.\u00a0In 2018, shipping was responsible for about 2.9%\u00a0of human-caused\u00a0CO2 emissions. The share of civil aviation was similar in 2019, at just over 2% (although this is somewhat higher considering atmospheric effects of flying).\u00a0 Shipping is a major factor when it comes to human-caused emissions Conservation International's\u00a0Shyla Raghav\u00a0says focusing on a state-based measure of carbon\u00a0emissions\u00a0does have its weaknesses, but she also cautions: \"What is the alternative?\" That leaves the question: Are we focusing too much on CO2 as a greenhouse gas when it comes to responsibility for climate change? Experts do agree that carbon dioxide is the biggest contributor to the warming of our planet. \"CO2 levels are a good guide to all emissions,\" Raghav said. Still, both Raghav and Andrew believe that other greenhouse gases should not be ignored when it comes to curbing climate change in the future. Methane , for example, plays an important role. The gas\u00a0is produced in agricultural \u2014 a famous example includes belching cows \u2014\u00a0and methane is also released during fracking and\u00a0oil production. \"I would say that China is not exclusively to blame for climate change,\" concludes Raghav. But with China currently the world's largest carbon emitter, she adds, Beijing now plays a critical role when it comes to\u00a0taking responsibility in the fight against warming. \u00a0 For CICERO researcher Robbie Andrew, the answer to responsibility for climate change cannot be based on\u00a0statistics alone.\u00a0\"You have to ask the question: Could China have developed in any other way? And what would China look like now if, somehow, they had not used all of the coal they have access to? Is China to blame because it doesn't have a wealth of hydropower resources?\" Andrew questioned.\u00a0 \"The question of responsibility and blame is very complex,\" he concluded. After all, China has set itself the climate goal of being carbon neutral by 2060. This article is part of a series in which DW is debunking myths surrounding climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     A rapid study by European scientists has revealed the impact of man-made global warming on recent extreme weather. They calculated the odds of record temperatures occurring with and without rising CO2 emissions. Last month's record-shattering heat wave across much of Europe was likely up to 3 degrees hotter due to global warming, an international team of scientists said on Friday. \"The July 2019 heat wave was so extreme over continental Western Europe that the observed magnitudes would have been extremely unlikely without climate change,\" their study concluded. Temperatures would have been 1.5 to 3 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) lower in a world without the effects of rising carbon dioxide (CO2)\u00a0emissions, the scientists said. Read more: \u00a0 German businesses fear repeat of historic shutdown of Rhine River Their rapid study was conducted shortly after Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Britain all recorded record-high temperatures during a heat wave that swept up from the Sahara desert. Scientists from the World Weather Attribution team used eight different sets of complex computer models to calculate\u00a0the odds of this level of heat occurring now versus a world without rising\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions. They\u00a0found that the record temperatures can be expected every 50-150 years in the current climate. But without \"human influence on climate,\" the phenomenon would happen less than once in 1,000 years. The team also reaffirmed findings by other researchers that global warming is making heat waves more common. The report's lead author, Robert Vautard of the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace in France, said Europe needs to get used to such high temperatures, as heat waves\u00a0are likely to become more frequent and intense. Vautard said that by 2020, temperatures during periods of extreme weather could rise by another\u00a03 degrees. That would make France's recent record high temperature of 45.9C, recorded in Gallargues-le-Montueux on June 28, more like 48.9C. Read more: \u00a0 Riesling wine, holding out between pesticides and climate change On Thursday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said July's scorching temperatures\u00a0\"at least equaled if not surpassed the hottest month in recorded history.\" New data from the UN's meteorological agency,\u00a0based on the first 29 days of the month, showed July 2019 may end up being slightly warmer than July 2016 \u2014 the warmest month on record. A similar wave of soaring temperatures in June made that month the hottest June since records began.\u00a0 The heat wave has now moved north to Greenland, leading to\u00a0a 10-15-degree spike in temperatures that is accelerating the melting of the island's ice sheet. In the Netherlands, one municipality is spraying salted water on its roads to stop them from melting or cracking in the extreme heat. The salt extracts moisture from the air, which in turn cools the asphalt. Much of Germany's autobahn network has asphalt coated with a special substance that absorbs moisture more quickly, according to local authorities. Austria's railway network has deployed an army of workers to paint a 5-kilometer stretch of rail track white. It wants to test whether the paint will help the steel tracks, which can expand and buckle during a heatwave, to stay cooler. The metal can rise to 70 degrees Celcius. Rail travelers near Blundenz, about 60 kilometers south of Lindau on Lake Constance shouldn't notice any difference. Businesses face potential revenue losses if consumers sit out the sticky weather at home. Germany's Bayreuth Festival saw a wave of returned tickets for performances of composer Richard Wagner's operas due to a lack of air conditioning in the theater. The Berlin Dungeon, on the other hand, helped tourists to stay cool by filling coffins with icy water and inviting visitors to dunk their heads. Europe's nuclear power stations rely on water from nearby rivers or seas to cool reactors used for electricity generation. A power plant at Grohnde, in central Germany, was due to be shut down on Friday afternoon because the water in the nearby Weser river was thought to be too hot. Lower Saxony's environment ministry said the plant would remain closed until the river temperature has fallen. In the German city of Wuppertal, a water cannon truck has been put to what environmental activists would say is a much better use. Some 40,000 liters of water was sprayed on the side of roads to keep the much-loved trees alive, which city officials said also aids road safety. After all, falling dead trees are a danger to traffic. City workers have also distributed 400 water sacks to younger trees. The heatwave has prompted a continent not known for air conditioning to consider, in unison, installing the temperature cooling devices. According to Google Trends, searches for air conditioning (Klimager\u00e4t in German, or climatisation in French) and similar terms have skyrocketed over the past week, along with \"pubs with air conditioning near me\" in Britain, which spiked 2,100%. During exceedingly hot temperatures, European zoos have begun freezing their animals' food to help them stay cool. Fruit, vegetables and even fish have been turned into popsicles on which the animals can feast. In the southwestern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the public has been asked to watch out for grazing horses, cattle and sheep left without sufficient water and shade.

The data should be \"alarm bells\" for policymakers, its director warns. Europe has had the highest fall temperatures in history The world experienced the hottest November on record in 2020, while Europe has had its warmest fall weather in history, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in\u00a0 a monthly report on Monday. C3S' analysis of surface and air temperatures found that the month was 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.44 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0warmer than the 30-year average of 1981-2010. This November\u00a0also broke the previous record by\u00a0more than 0.1 C, set in 2016. The data showed temperatures in the boreal fall (September-November) in Europe were 1.9 C above the\u00a01981-2010 norm, and 0.4 C higher than the average temperature for 2006, the previous warmest fall. The average temperature in November in Europe was 2.2 C above that in Novembers of the\u00a01981-2010 reference period\u00a0and the joint second-highest on record. The highest was in November 2015, at 2.4 C. Warmer average temperatures are increasing the risk of wildfires, such as this one on Australia's Fraser Island \"These records are consistent with the long-term warming trend of the global climate,\" said C3S director Carlo Buontempo. \"All policymakers who prioritize mitigating climate risks should see these records as alarm bells,\" he added. Earth is seeing an increase in the frequency and strength of extreme weather events as\u00a0human activities\u00a0such as the burning of fossil fuels contribute to a rise in average global temperatures. The changing climate has resulted in devastating wildfires and led to ever more violent tropical storms in many regions of the world. The five hottest years in history have all come since 2015. A landmark deal struck in that year, the Paris Agreement, aims to limit temperature rises to \"well below\" 2 C (3.6 F) above pre-industrial levels.

At the talks, Xi is reported to have warned of the possibility that climate change could be used as a tool to disparage some countries for not doing enough. \"Responding to climate change is a common cause of all mankind and it should not become a geopolitical bargaining chip, a target for attacks on other countries or an excuse for trade barriers,\" the official Xinhua news agency cited Xi as saying. The leaders also called for greater cooperation on protecting biodiversity ahead of an October conference on the issue in the Chinese city of Kunming. The talks came as US special envoy for climate change John Kerry was in Shanghai for a meeting with his counterpart Xie Zhenhua. The pair represent the world's largest economies \u2014\u00a0and the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide. They were meeting ahead of an upcoming virtual climate summit on April 22-23. Some 40 world leaders, including Xi, have been invited. The US and other nations are expected to announce more ambitious targets for cutting emissions during the summit. They were also expected to pledge more help for action on climate change by less wealthy nations. The US officially rejoined the\u00a0Paris Agreement on climate change in February after former President Donald Trump pulled the nation out of the accord. In an interview with the Associated Press on Friday, China's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said that China was unlikely to announce targets beyond its existing commitments. \"For a big country with 1.4 billion people, these goals are not easily delivered,\" Le said. \"Some countries are asking China to do more on climate change. I am afraid this is not very realistic.\" The UK-based climate data provider TransitionZero on Thursday said China needed to halve carbon dioxide emissions from its coal-fired power plants by the end of the decade if it was to achieve its existing aims. rc/aw (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa)\n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Germany and France agree on climate cooperation with China", "article_name": "germany-and-france-agree-on-climate-cooperation-with-china", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/germany-and-france-agree-on-climate-cooperation-with-china/a-57230283", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 2814, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:02:13.957826"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Water power is the largest renewable energy source in the world, but some plants are running out of water due to severe droughts. Is climate change jeopardizing the future of hydropower plants? Civilizations have used water as a source of energy for millennia, and it has been used to generate electricity for nearly 150 years. Water powers around 70 percent of the world's renewable electricity, and more than 15 percent of the world's total power supply. It's cheap, and unlike solar and wind, can produce electricity on demand. But building hydroelectric dams also reshapes ecological systems , inundates landscapes, and has forced millions of people to abandon their homes. And now, water power faces an added complication:\u00a0Climate change means some countries are experiencing severe droughts and reservoirs are drying up. The Guri dam in Venezuela during a drought in 2016 \"We cannot avoid the fact that climate change is having a remarkable impact on hydropower generation and it increases the challenge of managing hydro plants,\" Clemente Prieto of the Spanish Committee on Large Dams, told DW. Water power production falls This is a serious concern for southern and eastern African countries . Malawi relies on hydropower for 98 percent of its electricity supply. Last year, it suffered prolonged blackouts. According to the World Bank, less than 10 percent of Malawians have access to a power supply anyway, but key public infrastructure, such as\u00a0hospitals, was badly hit. Hydropower makes up 95 percent of Zambia\u2019s power supply \u2014\u00a0most of it from Lake Kariba, the world's largest man-made reservoir. But due to El Nino in 2016, water levels dropped to 13 percent of their usual capacity, Daisy Mukarakate, climate change program specialist with the United Nations Development Program Africa (UNDP), told DW. Richer countries have been hit too. Following four years of severe drought, a shortage of hydropower meant California had to use more gas to cover its electricity demand. That cost more than $2 billion\u00a0(\u20ac1.6 billion) and led to a 10 percent rise in CO2 emissions, according to the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and Security. In other words, Californians had to pay more for dirtier power. In Spain, hydropower generation fell by half from 2016 to 2017, meaning more fossil fuels were burned and CO2 emissions shot up by 40 percent. Latin American countries like Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil have had similar experiences. Yet despite uncertainty about\u00a0our future climate, reservoirs are still being built around the world. Does building new hydro plants make sense? The Munduruku people live mainly in forest regions and riverbanks, in villages spread along the Tapajos River in the Brazilian states of Para, Amazonas and Mato Grosso. With an estimated population of 12,000 to 15,000 people, the Munduruku are the most numerous indigenous group along the free-flowing Tapajos River. The dwellers of the Sawre Muybu Indigenous Land have sought for at least three centuries to officially demarcate their territory. The 178,000-hectare area includes rainforest that is threatened by illegal loggers and mining \u2014 and more recently, by the construction of reservoirs for hydropower. Munduruku people live largely as they have for centuries. Villages are represented by women known as \"cacicas.\" Maria Aniceia Akay Munduruku, from the upper Tapajos, has taken part in her people's movement against the construction of hydropower dams, including by demarcating indigenous land. She doesn't speak Portuguese: Her husband helps her to communicate with others outside the village. The Tapajos River is the essence of life for the indigenous Munduruku people. They depend on its water for sustenance, and to get around. The waters teem with vitality \u2014 there are 324 identified species of fish living in the waters, beside Amazonian manatees and giant otters. Along the river also live hundreds of species of birds, lizards and amphibians. Tapirs and giant anteaters ply the riverbanks, while jaguars and ocelot also prowl the rainforest and savannah. The region is among the world's most important for rare land and water species. Munduruku children attend the village school, under the guidance of indigenous teachers. In this picture, girls play in the shared classroom at Sawre Muybu village during their holiday break. Animals such as monkeys, parrots, dogs and capybaras are welcome among the children. Manioc flour is the staple food in Munduruku villages \u2014 cassava planted on the family farm is crushed, shredded and then roasted in a wood-burning stove. Also sweet potatoes, yams and bananas are grown. Although Munduruku consume mainly food grown in the local fields, items such as sugar, salt and coffee have also made their way into the traditional diet. They are purchased in town once a month. An aerial view shows the Teles Pires dam, on the homonymous tributary to the Tapajos. The lighter green color indicates the area of forest that was submerged \u2014 critics point out that rotting vegetation from inundated forest produces considerable quantities of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. The specter of ongoing drought also casts doubt on future usability of such hydropower stations. This aerial image shows construction at the Sao Manoel hydropower dam, which is supposed to begin operation by January 2018. Partially funded by Chinese companies, the cost of the project is estimated to reach \u20ac600 million euros. The plant, located on the Teles Pires River, will have the capacity to generate 700 megawatts of electricity. If built, the Sao Luiz do Tapajos dam would inundate this stretch of the river \u2014 including its shallows, rapids, beaches, waterfalls, inlets and shores. Once full, it would create a reservoir the size of New York City. Planned dams could flood up to 7 percent of indigenous territory, resulting in loss of land, poorer water quality and less fish \u2014 deeply affecting Mundukuru livelihood. Author: N\u00e1dia Pontes, Par\u00e1, Brazil Brazil is planning to build several dams , including over 40 in the basin of the Tapajos River \u2014\u00a0one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. The project has come under intense criticism for the impact it will have on local wildlife and indigenous human populations. But Greenpeace says that with many countries seeing their hydropower production decline, the Tapajos project is even more questionable. \"Why would a country whose energy security is already compromised by overreliance on hydropower aim to increase that reliance still further?\" a Greenpeace report reads. Instead, Greenpeace proposes a combination of wind, solar and biomass, which it says will, in the long term, be cheaper and more efficient, as well as far less destructive. UK researchers say \u00a0that if all plans currently on the table for new hydropower plants in eastern and southern Africa were fulfilled, the risk of power shortages could increase, since most\u00a0rely on the same scarce rainfall and would suffer a drop in generation at the same time. Still, experts like Michael Taylor, senior analyst on renewable energy with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), told DW Africa still has a lot of hydropower potential, and with such high demand for renewable energy, it cannot be ignored. \"There is a huge energy deficit in Africa and we cannot throw away options if we want to overcome underdevelopment,\" said Mukarakate of UNDP. But it is important to plan with projected changes in regional weather in mind, and to consider the type of facilities that will be most efficient. In Spain, which already has more than\u00a01,000 hydropower dams, Eva Hernandez, head of the water and agriculture program with WWF Spain, told DW the focus should not be on building more, but improving the ones the country has. Hydro: one piece of the puzzle Some are several decades old and need repair. But there is also scope to develop some conventional hydroelectric dams \u2014\u00a0which use the potential energy of water stored behind a dam by releasing it in a controlled way to drive a turbine \u2014\u00a0to include pumped storage capacity. Pumped storage uses electrical power to pump water from a reservoir at a lower elevation to a higher one. Then, when the power is needed, it's released again. As such, it tackles one of the problems with fluctuating renewable power \u2014\u00a0storage\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and boosts its integration into the grid, Hernandez says. Unlike fossil fuels, solar and wind power aren't produced to schedule or according to need, but depend entirely on the weather. Pumped storage is a way to convert excess power into potential energy, then\u00a0back into electricity, on demand. Taylor says hydropower shouldn't be seen as an alternative to other renewables, but as a compliment to them, making the entire energy system more efficient and the power supply more secure. \u00a0 The future energy system has to be renewable, but\u00a0Mukarakate says we still need to preserve a healthy mix of different energy sources. \u00a0 \"If we keep depending only on one source like hydropower, vulnerability will stay very high,\" she says. \"We have to bring all the options together \u2014\u00a0biomass, wind, solar, biofuels, etc.\" Focusing on the system as a whole is also key to a more secure supply for the African countries already being hit by reduced rainfall. Taylor says connecting up national grids means if one country is struggling with its power supply, it should be able to draw on that of a neighboring country to make up the shortfall. Ultimately, a greener energy supply is the solution to its own problems \u2014\u00a0the sooner we stop burning fossil fuels, the more stable our climate will be. The Grand Renaissance Dam in Ethiopia is currently the biggest dam in Africa and was previously known as the Millennium Dam. It is located close to the border with Sudan on the Blue Nile. Construction started in 2011 and the dam currently generates 6,000 megawatts annually. The reservoir holds back almost 63 billion square meters (68 billion square feet) of water and is one of the largest reservoirs on the continent. Its surface measures 1,680 square kilometers (650 square miles). The dam's walls are 145 meters (475 feet) high and 1,800 meters (5,900 feet) long. The Aswan Dan Dam is located close to the city of the same name In southern Egypt. It holds back 169 square kilometers (62 square miles) of a lake called Lake Nasser. The turbines produce 2,100 MW and due to the high production capacity, the Aswan High Dam ranks as Africa's second largest. It took eleven years to build and was opened in 1971. One of the world's biggest dams is located in Mozambique. The Cahora Bassa Dam has a capacity of 2075 megawatts and ranks after the Aswan High Dam. The major part of electricity produced is exported to South Africa. But sabotage during the civil war in 1981 prevented the generation of electricity for ten years. The Gibe-III-Dam is located 350 kilometers (155 miles) southwest of the capital Addis Abeba. In total it produces 1,870 MW and is, with a height of 243 meters (797 feet), the third largest dam in Africa. Construction began in 2007 and was completed in 2016. The Inga Dams in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) consists of two single dams. Inga 1 (generating 351 MW) and Inga 2 (1,424 MW). They were commissioned in 1972 and 1982 respectively as part of a failed industrial development scheme under then-dictator Sese Sekko Mobutu. The two dams currently operate at a 50 percent capacity because they have not been properly maintained in recent years. The two dams are located in the west of the DRC, 225 kilometers (140 miles) southwest of Kinshasa, and is located on the Congo River. The Congolese government plans to start an Inga 3 project, a 4,800 MW hydroelectric plant that would cost 13 billion euros ($14 billion). One of the top african dams is the Akosombo Dam. It sits at the base of Lake Volta, which has a surface area of 8,502 square kilometres and is the largest reservoir in the world. The turbines generate 912 megawatts, but the dam also serves as flood control. The Lake Volta itself is popular for being a way for trade and travel. Located on the Niger River, the Kainji Dam is the sixth biggest dam in Africa. It was built in just four years and opened in 1968. It is 65 meters (213 feet) high, 550 meters (1805 feet) across and generates a total of 760 megawatts. Africa's seventh biggest dam is the Tekeze Dam in Ethiopia. With a height of 188 meters, it is the highest dam in Africa. However the dam has a productivity of just 300 MW, so it only generates one-twentieth of the hydroenergy produced by its big brother the Grand Renaissance Dam. It took seven years to build and was opened in 2009. The Bujagali Dam in Uganda is located on the Nile River close to Lake Victoria and generates 250 MW. The dam has been operating since 2012 and is the biggest hydroelectrical dam in Uganda. The construction of two new dams, Karuma und Isimba, could change this but this would mean the resettlement of thousands of farmers and the flooding of protected areas.

{"id": null, "body": "     Adapting to the impacts of climate change is expensive. How can poorer regions manage? Mayors of Mozambique's coastal cities show how they are preparing for severe storms and rising sea levels with limited resources. Floods in the Quelimane municipality killed more than 70 people in 2015 Although industrial countries produce the lion's share of greenhouse gases globally, countries of the Global South are the ones facing\u00a0the brunt of global warming \u2014 and they often have the least resources to adapt to changing weather patterns and rising seas. Mozambique is among such\u00a0countries. Recurring droughts and floods destroy entire harvests, further threatening already precarious food security. One in four people already suffers from malnutrition, according to the World Food Programme .\u00a0 Increasingly intense tropical cyclones, torrential rains and rising sea levels threaten cities and villages along the country's coast, where 60 percent of Mozambicans live. Seven of the 11\u00a0major cities are located along the seaside. The impacts of climate change are being felt daily in these coastal cities \u2014 which\u00a0is why their mayors have taken adaption into their own hands as part of a\u00a0growing movement of mayors who are stepping up their game to fight climate change. Read more:  Politicians think globally, act locally to fight global warming Banking on nature In the Quelimane Municipality for example, which lies in the center of Mozambique's coast, mayor Manuel de Araujo has invested in mangroves. The roots of mangroves protect against erosion and help to purify water \"Sea level rise and erosion are a huge problem in my city as we have less and less land available for agricultural use,\" de Araujo explained to DW at the Resilient Cities conference in Bonn, Germany. \"The mangroves are our first line of defense against the sea,\"\u00a0 He has traveled to Germany along with other mayors of coastal cities to share their best practices in how to make communities more resilient with limited resources. One important factor in most adaption projects is to involve the local community, de Araujo points out. This is especially the case in the mangrove project, as citizens usually cut mangroves to use the wood for cooking and to build houses. By involving local residents and informing them about the role of mangroves for the local ecosystem and economy through radio programs as well through church, women's and youth groups, he hopes they will protect the trees instead. \"In my city, the number-one source of income is fishing,\" de Araujo said. It's important to understand that by cutting mangroves they are destroying the ecosystems where prawns and fish grow.\" \"When they see that fisheries increase, there is a big motivation for them to protect mangroves.\" Read more: \u00a0 Protecting paradise on a budget Shoring up homes Tagir Carimo, mayor of Pemba municipality in the north of the country, agrees that education is one of the most important aspects of making communities more resilient. In his city's plan to adapt to climate change, a key part of it is informing people and local politicians about the impacts of global warming so they understand which measures need to be implemented. Otherwise, \"people will just build their houses and then rainwater will wash them out,\"\u00a0he said. Heavy rains triggered the partial collapse of a garbage heap in Maputo in February 2018, burying more than a dozen people Together with the Mozambique Costal Cities Adaption Program (which is funded by USAID), the cities of Pemba and Quelimane developed prototypes of resilient homes. They can be built with local materials, but are sturdier than traditional houses which are usually made of mangrove wood, mud and palm leaves. The resilient homes have raised foundations to withstand floods, reinforced walls and steel roofs to weather cyclones. So far, funding has only sufficed for\u00a012 pilot houses. But since\u00a0local carpenters and other workers were invited to participate in the project, the mayors have noticed that elements\u00a0of the resilient houses are incorporated elsewehere. People replicate the parts they can afford, he says. \"Some people might build their houses on a higher foundation\u00a0but don't have enough money for the steel roof; others are inspired by the reinforced walls,\" explained de Araujo. \"It's still better than what they had before.\" A positive side effect of this project is that local carpenters\u00a0learned new skills that created opportunities for them to generate additional income, he added. Traditionally, homes in Mozambique are built with mangrove wood, mud and palm leaves Another aspect of strengthening homes is ensuring that they are not built in the most vulnerable parts of the city, for example in flood areas and seafront zones. Read more: \u00a0 Extreme weather: 'Africa is most vulnerable' To that end, Pemba's mayor Carimo has developed a \"vulnerability map\" which can be used to advise residents on where and how to build their houses. In reality, the advice isn't always taken up, he admits, because especially poor people who are new to the city move to informal settlements. Building alliances Yet, even with the most creative and innovative ideas, there is only so much local politicians can do with limited financial and human resources, the mayors asserted. Therefore, a vital part of their fight against climate change is also about building alliances with local, national and international networks \u2014 and in attracting donors. Read more: \u00a0 Climate finance: Footing the bill for a global crisis Mayors attended the Resilient Cities Conference 2018 in Bonn to share best-practice examples on how to make coastal communities more resilient Pemba has an annual budget of\u00a0$2 million per year to fix roads, pay wages, and so on.\u00a0\"It's not enough to face a challenge like climate change, that's why we are focusing on international networks and finding a twin city with similar problems to connect and learn,\"\u00a0said Carimo. With a huge smile, he added that his town is in the most beautiful part in Mozambique, in case anyone attending the conference would like to invest. The coastal cities have organized themselves into a compact: the Mozambique National Association of Municipalities (ANAMM), to increase their impact and make their voices heard on a national level. And the government has begun to listen, said Eduardo Nguenha, secretary general of ANAMM. \"The Paris Climate Agreement was signed by countries \u2014 but at the end of the day, it's local governments that design and implement tools, it's very much a bottom-up approach,\"\u00a0Nguenha said at the cities conference. \"Now, the national government comes to us so they have something to report back to their international partners,\" he concluded. It's mainly industrial nations that are responsible for producing greenhouse gases such as CO2 that contribute to climate change. But the main victims of climate change are in the countries of the global South. As Africa is hit by drought, storms, erosion and desertification, people there are starting initiatives to combat climate change. Mozambique is the African country most affected by extreme weather events. Entire neighborhoods in the coastal town of Beira are already endangered by rising sea levels and flooding from heavy rain. Experts say weather related disasters force twice as many people from their homes than conflict and violence. It's estimated Africa will experience some 20 million climate refugees within ten years. The world's leading climate change advisory body, the IPCC, estimates sea levels will rise by 40 to 80 cm by 2100. To improve water drainage, Beira is rehabilitating the river which flows through its center, carrying out reforestation and constructing a new canal. It is also building a barrier which can be closed at high tide to protect the town. The yellow sands of the Sahara desert continue to creep their way south, encroaching on the farmlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Eleven African countries are trying to stop this drift with a 7,750 kilometer long and 15 kilometer wall of trees. Tree roots stabilize and aerate the soil, allowing the absorption of water and stopping desertification. It will also provide people with new livelihoods. Soil erosion and desertification threatens the livelihood of farmers in many parts of Africa. Using a special irrigation system, Sounna Moussa from Niger is making his soil fertile again. His technique is centuries old but had been virtually forgotten. Experts also recommend growing traditional crops better suited to the soil. Hydropower is the world's largest source of renewable energy. Traditionally, it is seen as a reliable and clean way of generating power. But now hydropower is meeting more resistance from environmental groups and local communities. Sometimes whole forests are cut down or villages are relocated to make way for a new hydroelectric dam. All of Africa will have access to power by 2030. This ambitious goal was set by 55 African heads of state and government at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative plans to feed 300 gigawatts of green electricity per year into power grids across Africa. Wind farms like this one here in Ethiopia are just the beginning. People across Africa are increasingly generating their own green electricity rather than relying on dirty generators or unreliable grid power. Dramatic drops in the price of solar power now make renewable electricity more affordable, whether it's powering a hospital or school with a row of solar panels or lighting a home with a small solar lamp. In Africa, the upcycling trend hasn't just conquered the fashion world but also the construction industry. In Nigeria, people are building whole houses from used plastic bottles that otherwise litter the environment. It's estimated that a million plastic bottles are bought every minute around the world. Getrude Clement is committed to protecting the environment. Once a week, the Tanzanian teenager produces an environmental program for her local radio station. \"I hope my listeners are doing something to change the situation here - to protect the environment and keep our water clean,\" she told DW. She's seen here speaking to the UN General Assembly in New York in April, 2016. To make Africa more resistant to climate change, its effects need to be better understood at local and regional levels.

{"id": null, "body": "     A new UN report has warned that climate change repercussions for India will be irreversible if New Delhi doesn't take drastic measures by 2030. Are Indian authorities up for the challenge? The report notes that climate change is already impacting health, livelihood and infrastructure in India's urban areas The latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report has painted a bleak picture for India, warning that the South Asian country could face multiple climate change-induced disasters in the next two decades. Unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced by 2030, it will become impossible for Indian authorities to reverse an imminent climate catastrophe, it said. \"The IPCC report clearly delineates that multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact with each other, which will result in increased overall risks cascading across sectors and regions. It will pose unique challenges to India,\" Ritwick Dutta, an India-based lawyer at the Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE) organization, told DW. \"This should serve as a wake-up call for the Indian government to mainstream climate concerns across all levels of decision making,\" added Dutta, who received the 2021 Right Livelihood Award for his work with local communities. Scientists from 67 countries, including nine from India, contributed to the UN report on climate change. \"The report finds that water is central to adaptation. For example, a majority of adaptations are being forged in response to water-related hazards ,\" Aditi Mukherjee from the New Delhi-based International Water Management Institute told DW. \"On the one hand, water is a part of the problem as a large majority of world's population are experiencing climate change through water-related impacts, but on the other hand, water is also a part of the solution,\" she added. According to the report, more than 40% of India's population will face water scarcity by 2050, and at the same time the country's coastal areas, including big cities like Mumbai, will be affected by rising sea levels. Flooding will intensify in the Ganges River and Brahmaputra River basins, and at the same time crop production will be disrupted by droughts and water scarcity . \"It is an existential threat [for India]. The window of opportunity to deal with the crisis is closing,\" Sunita Narain, director of the Center\u00a0for Science and Environment in New Delhi, told DW. The report notes that climate change is already impacting health, livelihood and infrastructure in India's urban areas. The impact, however, will be felt more by economically and socially marginalized urban residents, who live in informal settlements. There has been 35% urban growth between 2015 and 2020, and cities will see at least 600 million more residents over the next 15 years, according to the report. \"Tackling different climate change challenges will require collective action. Governments, private sector\u00a0and local communities need to work together to reduce risks,\" Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, told DW. \"We have to move away from quick fixes. We need transformational adaptation to reduce the root causes of vulnerability by shifting systems away from unsustainable trajectories,\" he said. In November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged at the Glasgow climate summit that India can meet 50% of its energy requirements by increasing its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatt\u00a0by 2030. Modi also said India will reduce its total projected carbon emissions by 2030, decrease\u00a0the carbon intensity of its economy by 45% by the same year\u00a0and achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. Bhupender Yadav, India's minister of environment, forests and climate change, welcomed the IPCC report and told media the government is taking measures to reduce energy sector emissions. \"Environmental negotiations are not about give and take \u2014\u00a0they are about saving the world. Developed nations must take historic responsibility and consider what they have done in the past,\" Yadav said. Another IPCC report, which is scheduled to be released in April, will suggest remedies to tackle the climate crisis and how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \"India needs to act in its own interest. Our climate change strategy must be based on the principle of co-benefits. We should take measures to deal with climate change because it is good for the world, but also because it is good for us,\" said Narain.

When meat is so cheap in many countries, there's even less incentive to try. But the low prices found on supermarket shelves mask meat's hidden costs. Research has revealed that meat is being sold to consumers at just a fraction of what it would cost if it accurately reflected the true value of the environmental damage it inflicts. What if governments imposed a tax on meat to encourage people to change their diets? Many nations put a \"sin tax\" on products deemed harmful to society, such as alcohol and tobacco, so should the price tag on\u00a0meat not also reflect\u00a0its true environmental cost?

Humans' huge appetite for meat and milk makes cows terrible for the climate Switching to a 'flexitarian' diet The meat and dairy industry is on track to becoming\u00a0the biggest contributor to climate change, outpacing even the fossil fuel industry. According to an analysis by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and the non-profit GRAIN, the world's livestock sector could be responsible for 80 percent of the allowable greenhouse gas budget by 2050. The impact of meat was further underlined in a recent major study which found that huge reductions in meat consumption are crucial to avoid devastating climate change. Another\u00a0comprehensive study published in the journal Nature found Western countries should\u00a0 cut beef consumption by 90 percent . The paper's researchers have called for a worldwide switch to a \"flexitarian\"\u00a0diet to keep climate change under the\u00a0limit of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), meaning eating mainly plant-based foods and meat on rare occasions. How to achieve this? One suggestion the study authors make to reduce meat consumption is to tax it. The craving for meat can be both physical and psychological Eating meat to rebel Considering the western world's meat consumption, that won't be easy. In Germany for example, the average person\u00a0eats 60 kilograms (132 pounds)\u00a0of meat annually. Katrin Wenz, agricultural consultant at Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND), told DW that while levels of meat consumption are falling overall, she added there's also a reverse trend. \"We have a population group that isn't even that small \u2014 a few percent \u2014\u00a0where it's a particular trend to eat a lot of meat,\"\u00a0she said. This group\u00a0consists largely of men who do a lot of physical activity, and believe\u00a0they need large amounts\u00a0of animal protein. \"There's a growing consensus that animal farming should be reformed \u2014 and perhaps they think, 'I'll simply do what I want.'\" She added that in the whole of the EU, \"meat is very cheap, and that has to do with the fact that we import very cheap animal feed from South America.\" Read more: \u00a0 Beef (and Burger King) still eating away at forests Add to this\u00a0how\u00a0farmers' unions\u00a0for years had advised farmers to produce more, which led to cheaper prices, especially for pork. This has resulted in\u00a0decades of systematic price-dumping. \"We don't produce a high-quality product, but a cheap product for the global market.\" Meat's true cost Supermarket prices for meat are misleading, a\u00a0 study from researchers at the University of Augsburg revealed \u2014 and hide the huge secondary costs arising from the environmental impact of meat production. Upon quantifying and monetizing\u00a0the environmental impact of meat production in Germany, researchers found that conventionally farmed meat would cost three times the price the consumer actually pays. That's an additional cost of 196 percent (see graphic above). When the meat is organically farmed, those hidden costs amount\u00a0to 82 percent more than\u00a0the price advertised on the shelves. Such additional costs were calculated by quantifying three factors in animal farming: pollution resulting from nitrogen fertilizer use, greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage. These environmental costs\u00a0aren't obvious. For instance, they include the money water suppliers have to invest in filtration systems to remove nitrates from drinking water as a result of farming. This\u00a0cost is borne\u00a0by consumers \u2014 just not in the price of meat, rather in their utility\u00a0bills. \"The problem is that these environmental costs currently don't have a market price,\" Tobias Gaugler, one of the study's authors, told DW.\u00a0 From a purely economic perspective, this amounts to a \"market distortion,\" he added. \"Environmental costs, and pollution and the corresponding damage to human health, have a cost of zero,\" said Gaugler.\u00a0 These prices \"don't reflect the reality.\" Read more: \u00a0 Your hamburger, the environmental killer Supermarket prices for meat fail to include the environmental and health costs To tax\u00a0meat like alcohol and cigarettes? So could a \"meat tax\" be the solution to help reflect the true cost of meat, while at the same time encouraging people to cut their consumption? The investor network Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return\u00a0(Fairr) \u00a0is among groups calling for the introduction of a sin tax on meat. But not everyone is convinced that sin taxes are the way to go, including Gaugler. \"This step wouldn't be politically feasible,\"\u00a0he told DW. Although\u00a0such a tax is justifiable, the political will to do it is\u00a0lacking. \"Because people think, 'wait, I would have to pay even more for something,' and society wouldn't accept it.\" Gaugler instead calls for the bill\u00a0to be footed far earlier in the production chain, such as with the fertilizer producers, rather than landing directly on the consumer. \"Our hope is to change the whole market structure,\u00a0so that mass animal production [sector] would become more expensive \u2014\u00a0not because politicians say so, but because the market structure makes that happen,\" he told DW. Wenz agrees that a meat tax isn't the best way to go. In Germany, meat and milk products enjoy a reduced sales tax rate, and many vegetarian and vegan organizations are calling for that to be abolished,\u00a0she pointed out. Wenz believes people should trade their consumption of conventional meat for more environmentally friendly, organic meat.\u00a0 A meat tax would result in a distorted, higher tax on better-quality meat, she argued. \"You could tax, but not as an instrument to use on meat from more environmentally friendly farming,\" she concluded. Alternative ways to cut meat consumption Julia Kl\u00f6ckner, the German minister for food and agriculture, recently told\u00a0newspaper taz \u00a0that the German government has no plans to raise sales tax\u00a0on meat products from the current reduced 7 percent to the regular 19 percent, saying: \"Meat shouldn't just be for better earners.\" The German Ministry for Food and Agriculture told DW it was already carrying out a number of measures to help protect the climate, including trying to minimize food waste. To save the climate, the average global citizen should massively reduce their meat intake, numerous studies say When asked about introducing a tax on their products, meat companies either refused to comment or \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 didn't welcome the prospect. Westfleisch, one of Germany's largest meat producers, told DW it sees \"such an artificial price rise extremely critically.\" \"It benefits neither the consumer, nor the environment, nor animal welfare,\" a spokesperson told DW. \"Experience from abroad shows that despite the introduction of penalty taxes, consumption of affected products hasn't changed considerably.\" Westfleisch believes disseminating information and education for the generations to come would constitute a\u00a0\"more promising way to a sustainable change in meat consumption, nutritional awareness and possibly positive consequences for the climate.\" For Wenz, efforts to reduce\u00a0meat consumption should instead focus on consumer information to help informed decision-making; offering more vegetarian options at cheaper prices in canteens; and clearer labeling for meat products. With everything from meat contamination scandals to concerns about agriculture's climate change impact in the news these days, more and more people are turning to a vegan diet. But, there are other ways to eat in an environmentally-friendly way too. Free-range meat products are now commonplace. Rarely, though, are cows raised in such a paradise as this alpine meadow. In the 1970s and 80s, eating vegetarian, and especially vegan \u2014 abstaining from animal products completely, like milk and eggs \u2014 was not part of the mainstream. Nowadays, things are changing. Jonathan Safran Foer's book \"Eating Animals\" sparked thought about the meat people eat. More vegan restaurants are sprouting up all over the place; here are some dishes from 'P\u00eale-M\u00eale' in Berlin. Eating vegan can reduce carbon footprints and water usage worldwide. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the meat industry generates nearly one-fifth of human-made greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Scientists also say that 13,000 to 15,000 liters of water are needed to produce just one kilogram of beef. With the recent scandal surrounding Dutch horsemeat being sold as beef, more Europeans are now simply choosing to eat meat less. But, for those that can't do without, the \"Meine kleine Farm\" (My little farm) concept tries to achieve transparency with consumers. It aims to give each animal it sells as meat a proper identity. The Potsdam-based farm has a website showing the living conditions of the animals and giving customers a chance to vote online about which animal they want slaughtered next. Since they mainly sell to customers in the nearby region, the 'Meine kleine Farm' project also helps to keep transportation routes \u2014 and thus greenhouse gases \u2014 to a minimum. Eating locally and in season also helps reduce greenhouse gases because it cuts out long transportation routes. Canadians Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon argued for local cuisine in their book, \"100-mile diet: A year of local eating.\" The couple spent one year eating foods from within one hundred miles of their home. Self-preserved foods got them through the winter. The modern industrial agriculture practice of cultivating monocultures, such as corn and soy, can make the crops more susceptible to pests and diseases. This, in turn, promotes the widespread use of pesticides. Small-scale farmers, on the other hand, often promote crop diversity which makes plants naturally more robust, even in periods of drought. Cultivating one's own crops is possible even in big cities, as shown by the \"Princess Garden\" project right in the middle of Germany's capital, Berlin. Crops are grown and consumed locally, with food dishes offered as business lunches at an on-site caf\u00e9. The urban farmers here say gardening raises awareness about the environment and, since the garden is shared, they make friends along the way too. With Germans throwing away an estimated 20 million tons of food a year, food-sharing has become one of the latest environmentally-friendly trends. Restaurants or grocery stores donate still-edible food that they can no longer use to charity organizations. Foodsharing.de is an internet portal where people can swap food they won't be able to eat. Many dietary experts argue that a vegetarian or vegan diet can be good for your health too. Various studies show that a decrease in daily meat consumption may reduce the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity.

{"id": null, "body": "     The Germanwatch think tank says in its latest climate risk report that Pakistan is the world's seventh most vulnerable country to climate change. In a DW interview, expert Tariq Banuri explains the reasons behind this. DW: Experts link Pakistan's water shortage to mismanagement, but is there also a connection between the country's water crisis and climate change? Tariq Banuri: Pakistan has witnessed a number of floods in the past several years, and long spells of drought which, experts believe, are a result of climate change. Pakistan's rain pattern is already that of high magnitude and low frequency, which means we have more rain but for a shorter time, which does not help percolation and raise the ground water level. So, climate change is causing longer spells of drought, which is complicating our water scarcity problem. But climate change is not the sole cause of water scarcity; exponential population growth is also contributing to this crisis. For instance, at the time of Pakistan's independence in 1947, the population was low, and therefore the per capita water availability was more than 5,000 cubic meters per person per day, which made Pakistan a water-abundant country at the time. But today, it has fallen below 1,000 cubic meters per person, which is why we say that Pakistan is a water-scarce country. Banuri: 'The most urgent problem in Pakistan in this regard is population growth, which reduces the average water availability every day' In future, though, climate change will make matters worse in a number of ways. First, as mentioned above, the total quantity of water is likely to decline, thus increasing the scarcity level. Second, the water availability will become more erratic, thus increasing uncertainty and seasonal stresses and strains. Third, the increased temperatures will reduce water availability further because of higher evaporation rates while increasing crop water requirements and other water demands. Read more: Water scarcity in Pakistan \u2013 A bigger threat than terrorism Flooding in Pakistan kills dozens Does that mean that climate change is triggering droughts in some parts of the country? Pakistan has already experienced severe droughts in its southern region (especially Tharparkar in Sindh province) in 1998-2002 and 2014-17. It will most likely intensify because of the climate change, which threatens the situation in a number of ways. First, if glaciers continue to decline, the contribution of snow and glacier melt will ultimately decrease. Second, climate change will also affect the monsoon patterns (although current projections do not show systematic changes in this regard). Third, the higher temperatures throughout the country will increase water demand as well as evaporation. All three factors are likely to contribute to an increased frequency of droughts. But there are contradictory reports about the melting of glaciers in Pakistan. What is your take on this? The Indus Basin System is fed by glaciers from three interconnected mountain ranges, namely the Himalayas, the Karakorum\u00a0and the Hindukush. Of the three (also known as the HKH region), the glaciers in the Himalayas and the Hindukush are melting, similar to those in the rest of the world. The Karakorum, however, appears to be behaving in an anomalous manner;\u00a0for example, some glaciers are stable, others are melting, and some even appear to be increasing. This has puzzled scientists because no one expects glaciers to remain stable when temperatures rise. Read more: Climate change could make South Asia too hot for human survival by 2100 Ramadan leads to dehydration in Pakistani heat wave Experts say that climate change is also changing the rain pattern in Pakistan. How will it impact the water crisis in Pakistan in the coming years? This is a rather complex question. There will be lower rainfall in some areas and higher in others. Also, rainfall may become more concentrated, more intense for a short period. Some experts say that Pakistan is likely to \"dry up\" by 2025. Do you agree with this assessment? \"Dry up\" is a sensational phrase that scientists prefer not to use. As I said earlier, the recent trends suggest that aggregate water flows may have declined a little bit, but we are not sure whether this is temporary or permanent. In future, most projections show a declining trend and an increased variability of the flows. Most projections look at the next 50 or 75 years, rather than the next 10 years. The most urgent problem in Pakistan in this regard is population growth, which reduces the average water availability every day. Climate change will make it much worse. So, we advise that the authorities control population growth, carry out forestation and vegetation that helps percolation and in-filling of natural aquifer that serves as our water storage facility. Does Pakistan's development policy take climate change into account? Pakistan needs to have a development strategy that draws benefits from the direction in which the world economy is moving, so that we are not left behind while everyone else makes a successful transition to a low carbon economy.

Doctors want to spur global climate action by highlighting the link between the planet's health and human health. A man clutches his chest, coughing violently. Beside him, a woman clasps a hand to her forehead and collapses. Both reach out to a nearby doctor, begging for medical attention. But the doctor shrugs helplessly\u00a0and states the diagnosis: climate change, and it's critical. Fortunately, the patients aren't actually sick. They're medical students putting on a performance to show that global warming is already making millions of people ill, whether as a result of smog, a rise in tropical diseases or drought-related malnutrition. And the figure, they say, will keep rising unless negotiators at the United Nations climate conference taking place in \u00a0Poland\u00a0 \u00a0(COP24) make health central to climate action. Their predictions are also borne out in scientific research, which says warming of\u00a0 1.5 degrees Celsius \u00a0 above pre-industrial levels would expose a further 350 million people to heat stress by 2050. But Tarek Ezzine, a third-year medical student from Tunisia and member of the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations (IFMSA). says the impact of global warming on the human body is not getting the attention it\u00a0needs. \"We would like to put health in the center of all negotiations because the climate issue is a health issue,\" said Ezzine. He also wants to see health included as an indicator when countries report on their progress on emissions. Medical student Tarek Ezzine says health needs to be higher up the agenda Indeed, some in the scientific and medical communities think connecting what many still regard as an abstract environmental issue to personal health could wake humankind up to the depth of the problem famed broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough described while speaking at COP24 last week as having brought us within striking distance of civilizational collapse. Making climate change personal \"For some people, fighting climate change is something distant to their daily lives, something environmentally related,\" Maria Neira, World Health Organization (WHO) director for public health and environment, told DW. A medical doctor herself, she believes everything will change the moment people \"understand that this is connected with asthma, with lung cancer, with my stroke or my heart disease.\" Watch :\u00a0 Info-film: Our health and climate change Because the same human activities \u2014 such as burning fossil fuels \u2014 that are causing climate change are also killing people, by tackling the former, the international community could significantly reduce the number of deaths. The WHO says some seven million people around the world die prematurely from\u00a0 air pollution \u00a0each year. \"It's right up there with the biggest killers we have,\" said Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, a WHO scientist and co-author of the IPCC 1.5 special report\u00a0 \u00a0on climate change and health. Ten of the world's most air polluted cities are in the developing world Cutting exposure to air pollution would also reduce the cost burden on health services, according to a recent WHO report on health and climate. Each year, such exposure costs the global economy around \u20ac4.48 trillion\u00a0($5.11 trillion), which is roughly the same amount that governments worldwide spend collectively on health. \"So we're effectively subsidizing those fuels which are also killing people,\" Campbell-Lendrum added. \"Unless it's reflected in the price people pay or reduced prices for the cleaner energy fuels, it's hard to get people to change their behavior.\" Everyone is affected Developing countries have been hit hardest and are most at risk from climate-related fatalities and health problems, including malnutrition related to drought, an increase in vector-borne diseases like dengue fever, and intense flooding. They're also the countries where health care and emergency services are least equipped to deal with the problem. Read more :\u00a0 Climate change takes a toll on our minds, too Campbell-Lendrum says the impacts of extreme weather events, such as a forceful cyclone, can set a nation's economy back several years, \"including having to rebuild health care infrastructure, which has been destroyed.\" In 2010, Pakistan experienced flooding so critical that six million people needed urgent medical care, but because the rising waters also destroyed some 200 health clinics, it was difficult to treat patients. But wealthier regions aren't immune either, says Jeni Miller, executive director of the Global Climate and Health Alliance, a network of medical associations established to combat climate change and promote good health. An increased incidence of flooding, such as here in Pakistan, is one extreme weather event attributed to global warming Thanks to warmer, wetter weather, the territorial range of insects such as mosquitoes \u00a0is spreading, as is their capacity to transmit infectious disease, according to the WHO. In addition, the Lancet's \u00a0countdown report on health and climate change has projected that Europe will be particularly at risk to heat exposure because 42 percent of the population is over 65. In 2003, a record-breaking heatwave that has been linked to climate change was associated with 70,000\u00a0deaths across the continent.

When superstorm Katrina struck the US in 2005, it brought down power in\u00a0hospitals and stranded patients without food and water for days. \"Those hospitals weren't designed to deal with that kind of flooding and storm,\" she said. Engineers and urban planners now know how to construct hospitals and other infrastructure to be more resilient to extreme flooding but that requires more investment and planning, and\u00a0Miller warns that adapting our health systems is not enough. \"If we don't mitigate climate change,\" said Miller, \"the impacts will overwhelm our capacity to adapt.\" \u00a0 The protesters' symbol was a clock to signal to those meeting at the United Nations climate change conference (COP24) that time is running out if the world is to limit global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Negotiations at the COP have been tough, with disagreements on financing for developing countries and on how states should report their emissions cuts. Some marchers made giant puppets, including of Brazil's president elect, Jair Messias Bolsonaro, to protest the leader's climate policies. Bolsonaro has threatened to follow US President Donald Trump and withdraw his country from the Paris climate agreement. Bolsonaro has also talked about loosening protections for the Amazon rainforest \u2014 the Earth's green lungs. About seven million people worldwide die prematurely due to air pollution every year. Poland's air quality is particularly bad because of the country's dependence on coal for electricity and heating. Some protesters decorated pollution masks to make a statement about Poland's coal policy. During the COP, the country's president said there was no intention to phase out coal. Some groups, like the International Atomic Energy Agency, are promoting nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. It would provide a stable and greenhouse gas-emission-free energy source, says the IAEA. A number of protesters turned up to advocate against nuclear, because there is no good way to deal with the radioactive waste it produces and because it is potentially unsafe, they say. Sustaina Claus arrived at the climate march with his Christmas elves to preach the message of sustainability. The environmental activist says we need to stop overconsumption if we are to stop climate change and protect the planet's resources. Instead of buying mountains of gifts for your loved ones at Christmas, \"you should give the gift of you.\" NGOs said a number of environmental campaigners were refused entry at the Polish border or deported from the country, having been deemed a \"threat\" to national security. Climate Action Network, an umbrella group of climate groups, called the actions worrying. A spokeswoman for Poland's border guards said she could not say whether the refusals were connected to the COP, according to Reuters. Climate activist Lander Wantens cycled over 1,000 kilometers from Belgium to Katowice for the protest and to deliver a message to delegates to do more to combat climate change. He hopes that if the negotiators see \"four guys from Belgium are crazy enough to bike to the climate summit in Poland in winter, maybe that's a signal that they have to work on an ambitious climate agreement.\" Author: Jennifer Collins, Louise Osborne European cities are choking on fumes.

{"id": null, "body": "     The World Conservation Congress - the largest environment decision-making forum - is taking place in Hawaii. Ocean and climate change are high on the agenda. UN advisor Susan Avery tells DW why the two go together. This colorful fish searches vainly for food on bleached coral  Deutsche Welle: How do the ocean and the atmosphere relate to each other with regard to climate? Susan Avery: In our planetary system we have two major fluids, the ocean and the atmosphere. Think of them as two dance partners. In order to get a choreographic dance, they have to talk to each other through the \u201cocean-atmosphere interface\u201d - which is wave motion, spray and all the other things that help them communicate. The two create different dances: an El Nino dance, a hurricane dance. In reality what they do together is transport heat, carbon and water, which are the major global cycles in our planetary system.  So wherever we live on the planet, the oceans play a key role in weather and climate? Absolutely. They are critical in describing the entire climate system. And when you only talk about climate in terms of a surface atmospheric temperature, you are missing the complexity and richness of the ocean atmosphere role in the climate system. Hurricane forecasts, for example, have to include the heat and energy input from the upper ocean. That helps fuel the hurricane and determine how intense it is and how long it will last, and numerical models must include atmosphere and ocean. That's why it's so important that you have observations not only of the atmosphere but also of the ocean to put into the models. The ocean influences storms like this one, which became hurricane Sandra.  Alongside natural cycles and fluctuations, we humans have also been interfering with these patterns?  That's fair to say. When you take it to the climate scale, we talk a lot about the temperature of the atmosphere: increases associated with the infusion of carbon, which is human produced. The thing is that the extra carbon dioxide that gets released into the atmosphere through our fossil fuels and deforestation is also associated with extra heat. Of the carbon dioxide we release into the atmosphere, half will stay in the atmosphere, 25% will go into the ocean, 25% will be taken up by the land. But if you look at the heating , 93% of the extra warming is actually in the ocean. There are only very small amounts in the atmosphere.  So our seas are able to absorb a massive amount of heat?  Yes. The atmosphere is a gas, the ocean is a mass of liquid, which covers two thirds of our planet. It has a huge capacity to store heat, but that heat doesn't just stay at the surface. When you only talk about heat and temperatures at the surface, you're ignoring what's happening below the surface in the ocean, and once the ocean gets heated it's not going to stay there, because there is this fluid motion, and so we're getting to see greater and greater temperature increases at greater and greater depths. And once that heat gets into the ocean, it can stay there for centuries. Whereas in the upper ocean it might stay 40 or 50 years, when you get into the deeper parts, because of the density and capacity, it stays there for a long time. Avery tells her audience to look after the ocean  What impact does that have? The carbon dioxide we've put into the atmosphere already, and the heating associated with that, means that we're already pre-destined for a certain amount of global temperature increase. Many people say we have already pre-destined at least one and a half degrees, some will say almost two degrees. That's why it's really important to address the warming questions. But the heat is not the only effect. The extra carbon dioxide, when it gets dissolved into the ocean, through various simple chemical equations, will increase the PH or acidification in the ocean. So our coral reef systems and a lot of our ecosystems in the ocean are having a battle with warming. But those ecosystems that involve shell production and reproduction, as in our reef systems, are also battling acidification issues. This is really critical, because it attacks a lot of the base of the food chain for a lot of these eco-systems. This Hawaiian reef is suffering badly from bleaching  How can we make people more aware of these connections?  People who don't live on the coast think the ocean is not affecting them, when really it does. It affects them in many ways. I think we have to articulate what the ocean does, in terms of providing services to you as a human being. Every second breath you take comes from the ocean, so you should thank the ocean just for your ability to breathe. Thank the ocean for helping regulate our climate and rain patterns, thank the ocean for the fish and food supply it provides \u2013 and perhaps not over-fish it so much, so you can sustain that wonderful resource. Thank the ocean for filtering a lot of pollution. A little oyster can filter so many toxins out of our water systems.  You were the first woman and the first atmospheric scientist to become Director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. How have issues and priorities changed over the years? I took the helm at a very challenging time, in 2008. Shortly afterwards came the huge economic issues, for the US and eventually other countries. So we had to, as an institution, think of new ways to diversify our funding base, keep excellent science as the foundation, but look at new challenges. One was the creation of a new networked observing system which will provide data in the ocean 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 360 days a year. It was also a period where there were many crises in the ocean that we had to respond to from a scientific point of view: the Deep Water Horizon oil spill, the Fukushima meltdown and injection of radioisotopes into the ocean, the search for Air France 447 that was flying from Brazil to Paris and disappeared into the ocean. That was a real challenge for us in terms of looking at the technologies we have in a different way, solving a different type of problem, and from these crisis moments we learned a lot about our science and our technology, and how to improve it and go forward. Most people don't realize how difficult it actually is to get into the ocean. Satellites can only give us measurements of the near surface of the ocean, just because of the physics. The melting ice of Greenland is raising sea level and changing the salt-freshwater balance  Among the areas of the earth which are affected most strongly by the warming of our climate are the polar areas. The Arctic Ocean is changing dramatically. We just had a record warm winter, and a low extent of winter sea ice cover, what impact does that have? There are two major impacts. The melting of ice, land-based and the melting of the great glaciers, is basically a major contributor to sea level rise. The acceleration of ice loss in the Arctic, we now know, is a combination of not just the atmosphere, melting the ice from above, but also the warmer ocean waters that find ways through the fjords and de-ground these glaciers. So we are beginning to sea a very rapid increase in ice loss in the Arctic. That is a major concern for sea level rise. But the other issue is that when the land-based ice comes into the ocean, you get a freshening of certain parts of the ocean. So particularly in the sub-polar north Atlantic, you have a potential for interfacing with our normal thermohaline circulation systems, which could dramatically change that. The changes in salinity are beginning to be noticed, and changes in salinity are a signal that the water cycle is becoming more vigorous. So all of this is coupled together. What's in the Arctic is not staying in the Arctic. What's in the Antarctic is not staying in the Antarctic. I would say the polar regions are regions where we don't have a lot of time before we see major, massive changes, where we really need to get our observations and science and models working together.#bbig  Countries are making slow progress at ratifying the Paris Climate Agreement. Given that we have already put so much extra CO2 and so much extra heat into the ocean, is there any way we are going to be able to reverse what is happening in the Arctic? I don't have an answer, to be honest. I think we're still learning a lot about the Arctic and its interface with lower latitudes, how that water basically changes circulation systems, and on what scale. But I think what's really critically needed right now, to get a better sense of the evolution of the Arctic and sea level rise, is a real concerted observing network. We know so little, about the Arctic and the life forms underneath the ice. We have the technology. What I really see now is a confluence of new technologies, new analytical approaches, new ways to do ocean science. All it takes is money to really get those robots there, get the genomic studies that you need, and the analysis. Undersea technology is available but costly  If you look ahead to the coming decades, are you concerned about the ocean?  I am concerned about the ocean. There are so many stressors. We've talked about the climate change issue. Then the pollution issue, whether it comes from fertilizer run off, or pollution from industry, that get transported into the ocean. A lot of our global commerce is shipped via the ocean, our ships are not the cleanest and contribute to ocean pollution. A lot of visibility has gone to the trash we put into the ocean, particularly plastics, the long life plastics have in the ocean. We're just beginning to understand the science behind the plastic. Trash doesn't belong in the ocean. We certainly have overfished the ocean, but we are learning a lot that could produce aquaculture, in ways that are sustainable and non-invasive. So there are pluses and minuses. I do think the ocean is under threat. It's largely ignored in many ways, and we need to draw attention to it not just in terms of little pieces of it. We get so much from it, we want to make sure we sustain that.  Atmospheric scientist Susan Avery is President and Director Emeritus of the renowned Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the USA. She is also a member of the UN Scientific Advisory Board, which provides advice on science and technology to Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon.

After meeting Chancellor Angela Merkel, they said they asked her to step up to tackle climate issues. German Chancellor Angela Merkel hosted Fridays for Future youth climate activists, including teenager Greta Thunberg, in Berlin on Thursday. The talks about climate issues marked the second anniversary of the founding of the movement. Luisa Neubauer from Germany and Belgium's Anuna de Wever and Adelaide Charlier joined the 17-year-old Thunberg for the hour-and-a-half meeting with the Chancellor. \"We asked her to treat the climate crisis like you treat any other crisis,\" said Thunberg, following the meeting, repeating a key demand in an open letter sent to all EU leaders on July 16. The activists confirmed they discussed parts of the letter, which demands a halt on fossil fuel investments and subsidies. Greta also called for Merkel to \"be brave\" and become a leader in the crisis. The activists said Merkel had told them that she would take this into consideration.

Ahead of the talks, she said she expects \"a constructive exchange.\" \"I think we will have to wait and see which concrete results we take away from it,\" she added. Angela Merkel in the conference room with Neubauer and Thunberg Neubauer said that the activists spent \"a long time\" talking about equipping democracy to meet the challenge of addressing issues surrounding the climate, adding: \"We're asking for a lot \u2014\u00a0we know that.\" De Wever said that the coronavirus pandemic had proven what governments can do when faced with a crisis. They also discussed how to hit the goals of the Paris Agreement that aims to keep the global temperature rising below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Around 20 supporters greeted the activists outside the chancellery in Berlin. They held signs demanding action from politicians and chanted \"you are robbing us of our future\" \u2014 a phrase from a speech by Thunberg to the UN. The pandemic put a stop to mass gatherings and protests , forcing the movement online. However, the activists said they were now mobilizing , \"planning to strike online or offline \" as part of a corona-safe edition of last September's Global Climate Strike.

It just means that it's a clear signal that efforts really need to be redoubled to reach what we call net-zero or a carbon-neutral economy,\" Maxx Dilley, WMO's Deputy Director for Climate told DW.\u00a0 \u00a0 Dilley said that if the world acts the temperature will come down, although not overnight, urging people not to lose hope. \u00a0 \"It doesn't mean that if the temperature is 1.5 degrees up for a year that we should give up. On the contrary, it means that more urgent efforts are needed to keep the temperature increase rate from rising and also to try to try to bend the curve back downwards again.\" While WMO scientists said that any surge over 1.5 degrees Celsius may be temporary, there is a clear trend towards rising temperature.\u00a0 \u00a0 In the five years from 2015, the chances of temperatures breaching 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming in a single year was close to zero compared to one-in-two today.\u00a0\u00a0 And now, there is a 93% chance that at least one of the years between 2022 and 2026 will be the warmest on record \u2014 surpassing the 2016 high, which was exacerbated by the El Nino climate pattern. The average temperature over those entire five years is also 93% more likely to be higher than the previous five years.\u00a0 \u00a0 From 2022 to 2026, the annual mean global near-surface temperature is forecast to be between 1.1 degrees and 1.7 degrees higher than pre-industrial levels. \u00a0\u00a0 These new figures were reported in the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update, which combines highly accurate climate forecasts from around the world.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"I've been involved in climate forecasting now for 25 years.

And even with\u00a0warming limited to 1.5 degrees warming, scientists are predicting dire consequences.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Extreme weather patterns, including deadly heat waves and storms,  will be far more frequent,\u00a0droughts become more common, water becomes scarcer, species will die off as biomes change and biodiversity suffers, and the risk of chain-reaction-like emission events increases with the melting of permafrost and the reduction of forests. \u00a0\u00a0 \"We're seeing already glimpses of what a climate change world is going to look like. And I hope that is a wake-up call for everyone, policymakers and the public alike, that we need to do something,\"\u00a0Dilley said.\u00a0 But exceeding 1.5 degrees will lead to even more drastic consequences, such as the disappearance of low-lying countries like many Pacific islands and parts of Bangladesh. Extreme weather patterns become substantially worse at 2 degrees.\u00a0 Even at 1.5 degrees warming, floods like these in China will become more frequent and intense According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , there is an increasingly small window to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, with scientists calling for significant emission reductions this decade. \u00a0\u00a0 The IPCC report found that warming cannot be limited to 1.5 degrees unless emissions peak by 2025 and there are net-zero CO2 emissions globally by the early 2050s.\u00a0 \u00a0 To achieve this, rapid change across sectors will be required , with a particular urgency for an exit from fossil fuels and a transition to renewable energy. \u00a0\u00a0 Under current pledges \u2014 which largely exist only on paper \u2014 global warming will exceed 2 degrees. \u00a0 Edited by Jennifer Collins With the plans currently on the table, we are gearing up for an increase of 2.7 degrees Celsius. That would be much worse for the planet than adhering to the agreed-upon Paris goal of 1.5 C.\n\u00a0 Researchers have been left baffled as, unlike the Arctic, Antarctica has generally seen an increase in sea ice.

How can homeowners and insurers best protect properties in an increasingly unpredictable climate? Two brothers embrace after having lost their family home to catastrophic flooding in Altenahr, Germany Many people in Germany were blindsided\u00a0by the heavy rains and deadly flooding that hit\u00a0parts of the country in mid-July. Now, as homeowners take stock of the damage, a second shock could be in store when they seek their insurance payouts.\u00a0 Homeowner's insurance in Germany covers water damage; however,\u00a0not if it's caused by heavy rains or natural flooding. For this, property owners need to purchase special coverage. Such caveats, which are also the norm in many places besides Germany,\u00a0pose problems in a world where unpredictable weather is becoming the norm. Higher global temperatures \u00a0can lead to increased precipitation, making floods more likely. Insurance against severe weather is an \"urgently needed\" addition to standard homeowner's\u00a0insurance, said Sascha Straub, a finance lawyer working for a consumer consultancy in Bavaria. \"The damage that water can cause is so immense that it can ultimately be a complete economic disaster for the individual,\" Straub\u00a0told DW. \"And now we see the likelihood that it will also affect those who haven't had to reckon with water before.\" The cost for this supplementary coverage varies by location and type of property, Straub explained, and can range from 30% to as much as\u00a0300% of a standard homeowner's insurance policy for the most at-risk properties. Less than half of insurance holders in Germany have currently opted in to such extra coverage. The water is slowly receding, but the disaster is far from over. In devastated riverside towns in Germany, people are only slowly working their way through dealing with what the flood has left behind: bulks of mud and piles of rubbish. The flood completely destroyed Jutta Schelleckes' apartment. She and her injured husband had been living in the mess for two days before firefighters arrived and decided to escort them out of their apartment and help them find shelter. Jutta is only one of the thousands of citizens whose homes have become uninhabitable. What used to be people's furniture and household items has now turned into waste that fills up the streets. If not removed quickly, the waste can hinder rescue operations and impose safety risks to relief workers and residents. The mud can dry into a rock-hard surface that glues rubble to the streets. With volunteers' help, residents have started to clean up their battered homes and shops. Garbage trucks drive back and forth to remove the aftermath's waste from the streets. In Trier, one of the severely affected regions, 14,000 tons of flood waste was collected during the weekend, the spokesperson of the region's waste management association told public broadcaster SWR. In addition to an army of volunteers in disaster zones, countless solidarity initiatives were created to collect donations. The flow of donations quickly became overwhelming, to the extent that several aid organizations announced they have no more capacity to receive more donations. While the COVID pandemic has kept people apart, the disaster has brought communities in the region together.  Author: Monir Ghaedi Not everyone is ready to accept this cost, in particular\u00a0not those who might need it most.\u00a0 \"Insurance becomes less attractive for high-risk households or farmers when premiums reflect the underlying risk,\" the European Commission wrote in a 2018 report on insurance and climate change. \"Although lower-risk policyholders have a weaker incentive to reduce risk, they are more likely to buy insurance since premiums are more affordable.\" Yet those who opt out are rolling the dice. And in the event of a natural disaster, the state could also be expected to jump in . The German government\u00a0has\u00a0already promised swift aid to those affected by the floods . But getting even such\u00a0federal emergency aid can be problematic. In Bavaria \u00a0for example, only people who can prove that they tried and failed to get coverage can receive aid from the state, according to a report in the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung . It is also questionable to what extent such aid can cover the immense costs of reconstruction. And beyond that,\u00a0is it fair to stick individual homeowners with the costs of insuring against increasingly erratic weather? This is the question insurers and\u00a0regulators are currently trying to address.\u00a0 Our changing climate poses a\u00a0 conundrum for insurance companies , whose business model\u00a0relies\u00a0on their ability to quantify the risk of an event happening and bear the cost should it actually occur. This translates into collecting enough money in premiums to cover the cost of claims. And managing this won't be as simple as raising premiums to reflect higher risk.\u00a0 \"We are in a world where risk is just increasing day to day because more carbon is going into the system,\" Dickon Pinner, a senior partner at the global consulting firm McKinsey, said in the firm's podcast Reimagine Insurance . \"So just transferring that risk is insufficient.\" The growing unpredictability of extreme weather events \u00a0makes it more difficult for insurers to assess risk. And historic\u00a0measures are no longer the reliable indicators they once were. \"The changing nature of climate risk means that the likelihood of these events actually repeating in central Europe over the next 50 years will increase sevenfold,\" said Antonio Grimaldi, another McKinsey partner, in the podcast, speaking about the severe droughts seen recently in Europe. What these changes mean for insurance premiums in the short and long term is unclear. A higher likelihood of devastation could mean insurers raising prices to reflect the increased risk. But prices going too high could discourage people from getting coverage just when they need it most. On the other hand, a growing sensitivity to the risks of climate change might push more people to insure their properties against catastrophic weather. \"The more people who take out insurance, the lower the cost to cover damages, and the greater the scope for insurance companies to calculate premiums,\" said Straub. For this reason, he believes catastrophic weather insurance should be compulsory. In the wake of the floods, Germany's left and center-left parties as well as the Federation of German Consumer Organizations\u00a0(vzbv)\u00a0have\u00a0called for catastrophic weather insurance to be made mandatory. They added that it's\u00a0the duty of the\u00a0insurance industry\u00a0to provide homeowners with affordable policies to protect themselves against extreme weather. With a business model that relies on predictability, insurers also have an incentive to use their special role in society to shepherd the transition away from carbon-based energy sources, experts believe. \"At a macro scale, this is about massive capital allocation and reallocation,\" said Pinner. Insurers can send price signals through by diverting capital away from risky assets such as fossil fuels, he continued.\u00a0 In its report, the European Commission has suggested many ways the industry might help restore stability. Insurers'\u00a0data and knowledge could be tapped to help develop better building code regulations based on their assessment of an area's risk. Or, insurance policies could include clauses that require damaged buildings to be repaired to a higher standard than previously accepted, reducing the risk of future damage.\u00a0 But until such changes are put\u00a0into place, people will have to prepare the best they can for weather that is becoming increasingly harder to predict. \"It is not possible to plan where the next flood or landslide will occur,\" said Straub. \"Anyone could be affected. The more people who pay into the insurance pot, the easier it will be, and the cheaper it will be for everyone in the long run.\" China's central Henan province has been hit by the heaviest rains since records began over 60 years ago. In fact, forecasters say it was is the kind of rain only seen \"once in 100 years.\" From Saturday to Tuesday, 617.1 mm (24.3 inches) of rain fell in the provincial capital Zhengzhou. The average for a whole year is 640.8 mm. At least 25 people have died in the flooding, and another seven were reported missing. Officials feared more bodies would be found as the government upgraded its flood emergency response from level III to level II. More than 1 million people were affected in the surrounding province of Henan. Nearly 200,000 residents were evacuated in Zhengzhou, and some 10,000 residents in the province were relocated to shelters.\u00a0The military sent 5,700 soldiers for the rescue and clean-up operations, and 1,800 firefighters were also dispatched, according to Chinese media reports.\u00a0 Transport and work have been disrupted throughout Henan. Rain turned streets into rapidly flowing rivers, washing away cars and rising into people's homes. High-speed trains were suspended. Subway passengers reported tunnels being flooded and water almost reaching their necks. The Chinese military tore down a dam to release floodwaters threatening\u00a0Henan. China said troops had \"successfully opened a new flood diversion opening\" and averted the collapse of the Yihetan dam, around an hour from Zhengzhou city.\u00a0The rainfall had caused a 20-meter breach in the dam.\u00a0 Henan province is home to several cultural sites.\u00a0Fearing damage, officials shut down the famed Shaolin Temple in Dengfeng, known for its monks' martial arts mastery. The Longmen Grottoes \u2014 a UNESCO World Heritage site featuring thousand-year-old Buddhist carvings in limestone cliffs \u2014 was also forced to close.\u00a0 Residents tried to keep at least partially dry, holding umbrellas as they wade through the floodwaters. With road and rail links out of action, many were forced to take journeys by foot. This picture, which shows rescue workers evacuating residents in a trailer along a flooded road, gives some idea of the extent of the flooding in Zhengzhou, a city of some 12 million people. It's the endless city sprawl that is putting pressure on drainage. Questions are turning to how China's growing cities could be better prepared for freak weather events like the Tuesday storm. It's expected that they will happen with increased frequency and intensity due to climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     Environmentalists say Pakistan is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and government efforts addressing forests and greenhouse gas emissions do not go far enough. Torrential rainfall in Pakistan claimed more than 100 lives last week, while causing widespread property and infrastructure damage.\u00a0\u00a0 The southern port city Karachi was thrown into chaos . Residential and commercial areas were submerged, and power outages disrupted life for days. Climate scientists say Pakistan is especially vulnerable to wild weather and other effects of climate change including, sea intrusion, unusual rain patterns, glacial melting, rising temperatures and drought. The government in Islamabad says it plans to take action, but Pakistan's climate change challenge is formidable. \u00a0 Arid Pakistan has been facing stronger monsoons that what has been seen in the past. \"In 2018,\u00a0the total rain recorded in Sindh province during monsoon season was just 1 millimeter (0.039 inches). But in\u00a02019, it was 323 millimeters (12.7 inches), and so far this year we have seen rainfall totaling 450-500 millimeters,\" climate expert Jawad Memon\u00a0told DW. The Arabian Sea has also been heating up, with the average surface temperature increasing from 29 degrees Celsius (84.2 Fahrenheit) to 31 degrees in just two years, according to Memon. This has fueled the formation of storms that push the sea into coastal communities. \"The Indus River delta has been badly affected by\u00a0sea intrusion that harms people's livelihoods,\" he said. Environmental activist and chairman of Pakistan's Fisherfolk Forum, Mohammad Ali Shah, told DW that the problem in the Indus delta is being exacerbated by dam construction. \"The construction of dams had already reduced\u00a0water flow into the Indus delta , and climate change has accelerated the\u00a0process of destruction with sea intrusion claiming four million acres of\u00a0agriculture land over the years, forcing 1.2 million people to migrate,\" he said. One estimate shows a hundred acres of arable land being destroyed every day because of sea intrusion, according to Shah. Mangrove forests are also disappearing. Read more: \u00a0 Water wars: Are India and Pakistan heading for climate change-induced conflict? Khial Zaman Orakzai, a member of Pakistan's parliamentary climate change committee, told DW that Pakistan's government is addressing climate change with projects like tree planting, electric mobility and campaigns to reduce emissions. One project in the remote northwestern frontier province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), aims to plant 1 billion trees. \"We planted over 1 billion trees. In 2014, the total forested area\u00a0of the province was just 20%, now it is 26%,\" district forest officer\u00a0Shakeel Ahmed told DW. \"We\u00a0will get more plants from the federal government's 10 billion tree project\u00a0that will further increase forest coverage and help improve the\u00a0ecology of the province.\"\n Smog is another big problem in Pakistan's industrial eastern Punjab province, where winters in the provincial capital, Lahore, are choked with smoke. Thousands of brick kilns contribute to the problem, and authorities say they are addressing the issue. Muhammad Ali Ijaz, a senior official at Pakistan's Environmental Protection\u00a0Agency, told DW that \"zigzag\" methods of kiln production have been introduced to lower smoke levels. \"There are 359 industrial units contributing to pollution\u00a0in Lahore that are being monitored now. The zigzag technology was\u00a0introduced for brick kilns some years ago and 33% of the brick kilns\u00a0have already been converted to the technology,\" Ijaz said. The government has also been working to promote electric energy and mobility to reduce overall emissions and improve air quality. \"We have come up with\u00a0an\u00a0electric vehicle policy, aiming to have 150 buses powered with electric\u00a0batteries,\" said Orakzai. \u00a0A station has already been set up in the national capital, Islamabad.

Torrential rainfall in Pakistan claimed over 100 lives and caused widespread infrastructure damage last week Experts blame climate change-induced environmental patterns and human activities like dam construction for Pakistan's water shortage, which is reaching an alarming level Environmentalist\u00a0Memon has said that the government initiatives have missed the environmental issues that really matter. \"There is\u00a0no point in launching tree planting drives and promoting coal\u00a0simultaneously. We need to transfer completely to wind and solar,\" he said. Lahore-based analyst Ahsan Raza added that there have been problems with implementing initiatives. \"Imported plants are being planted that could do harm to the\u00a0environment. No environmental impact assessment of these plants is being\u00a0conducted. The government is planning river and seaside urban developments, which portend more environmental disasters,\" Raza said. However, Islamabad-based development expert and environmental activist Amir Hussain told DW that change will take time. \"In Punjab, they are restoring the biodiversity of Ravi river's basin and coming up with an anti-smog policy in the province and promoting vertical development of cities, leaving more space for parks and plantations. Similar policies are also being implemented in KP,\" he said. \"These policies will take some time to show their impact, but there is no doubt that the government seems sincere in addressing the issue of environmental pollution.\" Additional reporting by Shah Fahad from Karachi.

{"id": null, "body": "     New German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze from the Social Democrats is still largely unknown. In her first major speech in parliament, she has promised to at least aim to meet climate change targets by 2030. Svenja who? That's the question on many people's lips\u00a0when she was tapped as the new\u00a0environment minister . In fact, 49-year-old politician\u00a0Svenja Schulze\u00a0was previously known primarily in her home state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where she used to be science minister. Now, for the first time, she has taken the speaker's podium at the Bundestag, full of praise for Germany's efforts at environmental protection. Her speech described a continuing, decades-long success story. Read more : Germany's new government - same old story for the environment? And indeed, Germany is a driving force behind the transition to green energy, building solar and wind power plants. And it is the world's leader in waste sorting. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00a0was even celebrated internationally as the \"climate chancellor.\" Dents in\u00a0environmental record But in recent years, the country that once spearheaded\u00a0environmental and climate protection has seen its track record dented. Greenhouse gas emissions have risen again because there are still too many coal-fired power plants, especially in Schulze's home state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Germany will barely be able to achieve its goal of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent by 2020 - somewhat embarrassing for the former trailblazer in environmental protection. Read more : Climate scientists should cut back on air travel\u00a0 \"It is true, and this coalition has openly admitted that there is a gap in our ability to reach our 2020 climate protection goals that cannot yet be closed, despite the efforts made in recent years,\" Schulze admitted. Let's phase out fossil fuel,\u00a0but when? Schulze now wants to convene a special commission to clarify when Germany will be able to phase out fossil fuel power stations. For many critics her plan\u00a0is not ambitious or fast enough, because no fixed date has been set. Read more : Time running out to save the Earth's plants and animals But Schulze has said quite openly that she is also keeping an eye out for the workers who still work in the coal industry. She also said she will always have to consider the social impact of any environmental policies.\u00a0Next year, the new minister plans to present a climate protection law, which will make the goal of saving 55 percent of greenhouse gases by 2030 legally binding. 'I'm not a fan of driving bans' And then there is the ongoing diesel scandal . And part of this is the danger that millions of drivers will be threatened with driving bans because the safe thresholds for nitrogen oxides have been exceeded in many cities.\u00a0\"I am certainly not a fan of driving bans. But I also know that we are going to need some innovative solutions if we want to prevent them,\" Schulze says. \"The perpetrators are not the motorists who bought cars in good faith, believing that they were environmentally friendly. The perpetrators are the car manufacturers.\" They will soon have to carry out, and pay for, extensive retrofittings, she said. With this, it would seem that the first conflict is looming with the new transport minister, Andreas Scheuer from the Christian Social Union (CSU). Unprecedented heat waves swept across the globe in 2017, leading to droughts, wildfires and even deaths. Australia started the year with temperatures near 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), the \"Lucifer\" heat wave brought the mercury above 40 degrees Celsius throughout Southern Europe in July and August and scorching heat hit India's most vulnerable people. Get ready for next summer... Earlier this year, scientists realized that coral bleaching in Australia's Great Barrier Reef was worse than first thought. In some parts of the UNESCO World Heritage site, up to 70 percent of the coral has already been killed. By 2050, scientists have warned 90 percent of the reef could disappear. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are the main culprits. Armed conflicts are pushing millions of people to leave their homes or live in terribly precarious situations \u2014 and climate change is making it worse. A lack of natural resources increases the risk of conflict and makes life even harder for refugees. South Sudanese families, for instance, are escaping to neighboring countries like Uganda and Kenya \u2014 countries already suffering from drought. From New Zealand to Spain, from California to even Greenland: the world has seen a nonstop year of wildfires. Global warming has been blamed for the increased fire risk, and in some countries that risk has turned into reality. Wildfires engulfed large areas of Europe's Iberian Peninsula, causing death and destruction, while firefighters in California have had no rest for more than six months. Hurricanes Maria and Irma, which hit the Caribbean region in August and September, were two of the year's most damaging weather events. The list of deadly storms also included Ophelia in Ireland, Harvey and Nate in Central America and the US, and Xavier and Sebastian in Germany. Warming of the ocean surface has led to more evaporation, and that water may help fuel thunderstorms and hurricanes. In July, one of the largest icebergs ever recorded separated from the Larsen C ice shelf \u2014 one of Antarctica's biggest \u2014 reducing its area by more than 12 percent. While calving icebergs in the Antarctic are part of a natural cycle, scientists have linked the retreat of several Antarctic ice shelves to global warming and are closely monitoring potential long-term effects. Deteriorating air quality causes thousands of deaths around the world every year. India's capital, New Delhi, is one of the world's most polluted cities. In November, large parts of northern India and Pakistan were engulfed by a blanket of thick smog carrying harmful particulate matter. Schools were forced to close, and hospitals were full of people with respiratory problems. The high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere represent a major threat for our oceans, already in danger due to plastic pollution, overfishing and warming waters. Ocean acidification could make these waters \u2014 covering more than two-thirds of our planet's surface \u2014 a hostile environment for sea creatures. And without marine animals, entire ocean ecosystems are at risk. Superstorms often trigger flash floods and mudslides. In late December, more than 230 people were killed when a storm hit the Philippines' second-largest island of Mindanao, a tragedy exacerbated by years of deforestation. In 2017, severe floods also hit countries such as Vietnam, Peru and Sierra Leone. European countries, including Greece and Germany, also felt the damaging effects of heavy rain. Author: Irene Banos Ruiz Glyphosate to be phased out Schulze also had, at the ready, a small declaration of war on the new and old coalition partners from the Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU). At the end of last year, former agriculture minister Christian Schmidt\u00a0sparked a heated dispute with the Environment Ministry. Without consulting the then-Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, he voted in favor of continuing to authorize the highly controversial pesticide glyphosate in the European Union. Read more : Glyphosate: the key points in an endless debate Schulze does not want a repeat of this.\u00a0\"My hope is that this was a one-off gaffe and that we can assume that there is a new spirit prevailing in the current German government and that such foul play will not happen again.\" Schulze announced that the use of glyphosate will be stopped as soon as possible. Climate change deniers in parliament Schulze rather surprisingly took over the office of environment minister from her party colleague Barbara Hendricks. Karsten Hilse, member of parliament for the right-wing populist \"Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland\" (AfD), wasted no time in making it clear to the new minister what she can expect to deal with in the Bundestag. For him, the greenhouse effect is simply a lie. The other parties want to give Svenja Schulze time to set her own course of action. But according to Judith Skudelny from the Free Democrats\u00a0(FDP), only 3\u00a0percent of the coalition agreement was devoted to environmental protection. This will certainly be one of the new Minister's most important tasks -\u00a0to attract more attention to environmental and climate protection in Germany. \u00a0 EU member states have again put off a decision on renewing the controversial weed killer glyphosate. Could Europe really be close to banning glyphosate \u2014 and what would a possible ban mean for farmers and consumers? (25.10.2017)\n\u00a0 EU member states have voted to extend the license for controversial weed killer glyphosate. Germany's approval was crucial in the vote, but it could derail coalition talks between Merkel's conservative bloc and the SPD.

{"id": null, "body": "     The \"Fridays for Future\" protests have reinvigorated the debate on climate change around the world. An exhibition in Tel Aviv now shows how cities can use innovative technologies to limit the effects of global warming. The future of transport: These \"Personal Rapid Transit\" pods are taking over Masdar City in Abu Dhabi Just a few days ago, the sizzling winds of the \"sharav\" desert storm swept across Tel Aviv, resulting in record temperatures throughout Israel of up to 50 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit). With its air conditioning working on overtime, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art\u00a0provides some convenient relief from the heat, where the latest exhibition \"Solar Guerrilla:\u00a0Constructive Responses to Climate Change\" focuses exactly on what's happening outside: changing weather patterns and global warming. Upon entrance, the first thing you see is a wall covered in strips of colorful lines. This is not just any art installation: These lines meticulously document how the climate has actually changed around the world since the mid-19th century. Blue lines begin to turn orange and eventually reach dark red hues, referring not only to the climate in Israel but in\u00a0other parts of the world as well. The average annual temperature of Germany, for example, shifted from 6.6 degrees Celsius (44 Fahrenheit) to 10.3 (50.5 Fahrenheit) during that period, according to the installation. The data used for this visualization comes from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). However, the exhibition primarily hopes to highlight solutions to climate change and not just document its dangers. Curator Maya Vinitsky (l.) and climate scientist Orli Ronen Rotem (r.) are hoping to showcase new solutions to global warming 'Climate change is real' The colorful graphics of this installation are juxtaposed with another work, which documents climate change with layers of rock formations highlighting that over millions of years, the global climate has indeed repeatedly been subject to variation and change \u2014\u00a0but never over the span of\u00a0a few decades, as is the case now. Climate expert Orli Ronen from Tel Aviv University, who joined the museum team as a consultant on the \"Solar Guerrilla\" exhibition, says that the show aims to convey two important messages: \"One is that climate change is real, and has drastic consequences. And it's man-made. The other message is that we can still do something about it. We can no longer stop climate change but there are solutions to, at the very least, slow it down.\" Ways to respond to global warming The exhibition doesn't just document global warming but wants to highlight the efforts of those who are trying to prevent it. Another large collage at the entrance of\u00a0the museum shows various climate activists fighting for change, featuring pictures of protesters with signs \u00a0reading \"We are drowning. We are fighting\" and \"Rise for climate.\" These are images from the \"Fridays for Future\" protests started by the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. The exhibition hits a nerve. \"It's true, for once we're not just curators but also somehow activists, however, in a rather subdued manner,\" curator Maya Vinitsky told DW. \"We're trying to use this exhibition as a way to show people how they respond (to climate change). There are many possibilities. Joining street demonstration is one of many ways.\" Vertical gardens to the rescue: Many cities like Singapore or Tel Aviv (picture) are trying to offset some of their carbon footprint with innovative ideas Technological solutions The exhibition highlights numerous solutions to combat global warming through technology, among them a little measuring tool for energy used in your household called \"Sense.\" The device plugs into your electric panel at home and then tells you \u2014\u00a0via app \u2014\u00a0how much electricity is being used by each device in your home. That way, you can make more educated decisions on what devices might be worth unplugging and which ones you want to keep on stand-by all the time. Another such example is Watergen, a company that succeeded in creating a machine that turns humidity in the air into drinkable water. And there's the so-called PodCar, a little vehicle powered by a lithium phosphate battery which is recharged with solar energy. Abu Dhabi's Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates, which prides itself as being the \"city of the future\" for its ambitious plans to transform into a sustainable community free of fossil fuels, has been using the little cars since 2010. Many VIPs visiting Abu Dhabi have already ridden the little pod, including leaders like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Climate neutral designs The exhibition also looks at cities and municipalities that seek out innovative solutions to deal\u00a0with climate change. It highlights the vertical gardens of Singapore, the rooftop tree yards of Chicago and the \"Eco Wave Power\" plant, which powers Tel Aviv itself by harnessing the energy of sea waves. Among other Israeli inventions and solution, the show also presents a new neighborhood being created in the north of Tel Aviv, designed to be completely climate neutral. Here, electricity will be harnessed by solar energy and room temperature will be controlled not by electricity but using a minuscule amount of natural gas. Architecture, design and city planning take center stage at the exhibition in general, which makes sense, as one of the main departments of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art actually focuses of architecture and design.\u00a0 \"Let's be honest,\" says climate expert Orli Ronen, \"We failed as scientists. Climate change should be the main talking point anywhere, in every caf\u00e9. But it isn't. But I'm grateful for each and every attempt to mobilize people about climate change, and a museum is the kind of place where people are open to\u00a0new ideas.\" \"I think it will be impossible for anyone to see this show and not want to jump into action in some way.\" What do urban kids, picnic lovers, animals and bees have in common? They all need nature to be happy. A learning pack about the discovery and creation of green oases in the city. (17.12.2018)\n\u00a0 Forests are often called the \u201cearth\u2019s green lung,\u201d because they store CO2 and produce oxygen, thus helping to regulate the climate. But what happens if our forests disappear and what can we do to help protect them? (10.10.2018)\n\u00a0 All tickets for outbound flights from French airports will include a green tax from 2020. It is expected to raise \u20ac180 million a year, which will pay for more environmentally friendly means of transportation.

For those of us who thought installing solar panels, planting trees and switching to an electric car would do the trick, this month's report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was a startling wake-up call. The world is facing a climate catastrophe, and urgent and unprecedented changes are needed, it said. That includes carbon capture and storage (CCS) , a technology that in the past has been fraught with problems. CCS is extremely expensive, and critics have long argued that it is nothing but an excuse for the fossil fuel industry to carry on as normal, to the detriment of the growth of renewable alternatives. Yet in Norway, the technology is gaining traction. Little surprise, given the country's continued plans to exploit oil . \"The climate challenge is so big that you have to use all the tools that you have in your toolbox,\" said Trude Sundset, CEO of Gassnova, the Norwegian state company responsible for finding CCS solutions for the future. While renewable energy production is growing quickly, many industries, like cement and steel, emit vast amounts of CO2 in their production processes. This is where carbon capture technology is the only solution\u00a0\u2014 apart from shutting down production altogether, Sundset argued. \"You can put as many solar panels on all the cement factories as you want, but you will still have very high CO2 emissions from this industry,\" she said. \"And the only solution that we know of today is to capture the CO2 and store it underground.\" Read more: \u00a0 The rise of wooden skyscrapers First project on the horizon With Norwegian government support, Gassnova is now entering the final stages of a pilot project that could see the first full-scale carbon capture plants installed at a cement factory and a waste incinerating facility . Each would capture 400,000 tons of CO2 annually\u00a0\u2014 that's equivalent to the\u00a0emissions from 171,000 cars. \"The process of making cement in itself emits a lot of CO2, and the total cement production in the world represents 5 to 7 percent of the total CO2 emissions every year,\" said Per Brevik, director of sustainability and alternative fuels at Heidelberg Cement Northern Europe, part of Gassnova's pilot project. Read more: \u00a0 Concrete answers to a recycling problem The plant, a two-hour drive south of the Norwegian capital, Oslo, has already tested various carbon capture methods and hopes the full-scale solution will be up and running by 2024. \"We will take out the CO2 from the flue gas, condition it and store it on the bottom of the North Sea,\" Brevik explained.\u00a0 Oslo's Klemetsrud waste incinerator plant is one of two pilot projects for full-scale carbon capture and storage technology Financial incentive: Higher emissions taxes? The idea of removing CO2 from the air to store it in porous rock under the seafloor is not a new one. Norway's state energy company, Equinor,\u00a0has run a CCS plant on one of its natural gas platforms in the North Sea since 1996, proving the technology works.\u00a0 That particular project makes economic sense, thanks to Norway's CO2 emissions tax of \u20ac52 ($60) per ton on offshore oil and gas installations. Equinor would have had to fork out \u20ac105,000 a day to release the CO2 into the atmosphere, making CCS a cheaper alternative. \"The problem is, there is no business model for this [onshore],\" said Sverre Overa, a project director at Equinor. The current European CO2 tax is less than \u20ac20 per ton \u2014 although\u00a0that price is set to increase in 2019. \"The quota prices that exist are not sufficient today to cover the cost both of capturing and storing the CO2,\" said Overa. \"Over time we believe that gap will be closing. Deploying more and more of these facilities will bring the cost curve down, like it has for renewables.\" Read more:\u00a0 Dip in China's CO2 emissions sparks cautious optimism \u00a0 Could oil and gas know-how save the day? Perhaps somewhat paradoxically, Norway's experience with offshore oil and gas exploration could start benefiting the environment. Gassnova is now using this technical know-how to prepare a CO2 storage infrastructure that could be implemented across\u00a0Europe. Read more: \u00a0 Engineering the climate \u2014 is it a good idea? Captured CO2 will be liquefied and transported on ships to a facility on Norway's western coast. From there, it can be piped out to the North Sea and pumped some 3,000 meters (about 10,000 feet) down into porous rock formations. \"If we succeed in setting up our own infrastructure, industries in the UK, Germany and elsewhere can see that if they capture their emissions from their industry, they can actually send it somewhere and somebody will make sure it is safely stored,\" said Gassnova's Sundset. Industry insiders have said there is already interest in the Norwegian CCS model from companies elsewhere in Europe. \"Norway is very much one of the front-runners on CCS in Europe; it's really shown that CCS can be deployed as a technology to help reduce CO2 emissions on an industrial scale,\" said Luke Warren of the Zero Emission\u00a0Platform, an interest organization of\u00a0the CCS industry and research groups, which also advises the European Commission on the technology. \"The next phase of Norway's program, which is developing the infrastructure to enable capture from multiple industrial sources, is really exciting. And I think if this project is realized, there will be opportunities for other sources within Europe to access the infrastructure there,\" he said. Dependent on\u00a0government support Previous Norwegian governments have shelved large-scale CCS projects, but the current administration has so far provided the necessary funds for the pilot projects. Read more: \u00a0 Can we live in a world without fossil fuels? In its latest budget proposal in October, the government set aside a further \u20ac71 million for the development of CCS technology. It has promised a final decision on whether to go ahead with the two full-scale carbon capture plants and the infrastructure for CO2 storage under the North Sea by 2021. The total cost has been estimated to be \u20ac1.6 billion. Energy companies Equinor, Shell and Total are already involved in the development of Norway's CCS project, carrying some of the costs alongside the Norwegian state. But it remains to be seen who will foot the greater part of the final bill. Containers for cleaning products are made with oil-based plastics. They are fairly stable, light and cheap. Their contents are also by and large oil based. Surfactants are detergent substances that remove grease and water-based stains and are poisonous for aquatic organisms. People with allergies can break out in rashes and acne from them, too. Lemons were long used as cleaning agents before the industrial cleaning revolution. Citric acid has similar scrubbing abilities as vinegar and sodium bicarbonate \u2014 without the dangerous side affects. Citrus cleans grills and combats germs on cutting boards. The organic solutions are plentiful, biodegradable, affordable and can come free of packaging. About 380 million tons of plastics are produced every year worldwide, but only 9 percent of that is recycled, according to a University of California study. The rest is burned, dumped or sent to a landfill. Even recycled material gets quickly trashed again. Researchers estimate that 34 billion tons of plastic will have been produced by 2050. The flood of plastic won't stop if people don't change their ways. That's what the European Commission has concluded, and it wants to ban sales of plastic cutlery and straws. These are items that are quickly produced, used and thrown away, only to then burden the planet for centuries to come. One major packaging producer, Tetra Pak, has since announced it will change over to making paper straws. Germany is Europe's top producer of plastic waste, according to the Federal Environment Agency. Single-family homes purchase items in smaller and individually wrapped quantities. Plastic and styrofoam packaging is generated by online shopping and used for coffee and food on the go. The city of Hanover has taken the lead by introducing a 2-euro ($2.32) deposit scheme for reusable cups. India has a major problem with plastic waste. New Delhi, the capital, has banned single-use plastic, but it is just a drop in the bucket. About 1.5 million Indians earn a living collecting plastic; there is no functioning disposal system. Trash is often burned, which releases poisonous fumes. Containers can be more ecologically friendly, too. Before the era of plastic, dairy products came in glass. Packaging for drinks can be made out of renewable materials like wood from sustainable sources. Consumer choices can be decisive in the potential reduction of materials based on fossil fuels. Every CD and DVD contains about 30 grams of crude oil, and 40 billion discs are produced every year around the world, each one made of polycarbonate, aluminum and lacquer. Many of these get thrown away. Germany's recycling rate is about 5 percent, according to the Federal Environment Agency, though the waste gets turned into eyeglass frames, computer monitor housings and vehicle bumpers. Who says high-end consumers don't care about their ecological footprint? Gucci customers take pumps made from bioplastics in stride. Former researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute took lignin, plant fibers and wax and liquefied the compounds together. Injecting the mixture into molds allows the malleable material to be turned into other products. This soccer top is made from recycled plastic waste \u2014 polyester and polyamide, which are derived from increasingly scarce oil resources. It takes 28 plastic bottles to make one jersey, but that can also be made from natural fibers like cotton, wool, linen, hemp and silk. It's never too early to learn proper oral hygiene \u2014 not just how to brush, but also which brush to use. Common toothbrushes are made of polyamide, a product based on mineral oil. Stabilizers, softening agents and dye are in the mix, too. Back to basics: Toothbrushes can be made of beech wood with pigs' bristles. Tooth powder from sodium bicarbonate, coconut oil, charcoal, and a mix of turmeric, mint, clove, sage, ginger and healing clay can be just as effective as traditional toothpaste, making use of microorganisms, chalk and fennel oil. Yet much of the packaging is still plastic. Some toothpastes contain small, plastic beads. In the market for a new mattress? Sleeping habits, orthopedic conditions, weight, allergies and material preference (spring, latex, natural rubber or foam) all play a role. Most mattresses are made from oil-based products. Eco-mattresses contain bioplastics made from sunflower oil and castor oil. Interior designers say that the bathroom is the new living room. Many people are after something special: Toilet covers that lower automatically to reduce noise, automatic toilet seat cleaning, integrated music systems. Most bathroom items contain plastic. The eco-toilet is instead made of wood. No plastic bin required. Biodiesel from canola oil only works with old, smelly diesel motors. Biogas only works as a small component in fuel. The auto industry is looking for energy alternatives to oil, but we are still a ways off from going completely without black gold. Even batteries need oil in their production. One bright spot: hydrogen. Regardless, the car itself contains a lot of crude oil. The UN has issued its starkest warning yet over climate change, but says it's not too late to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Political will is required \u2014 but there are also things you can do. (09.10.2018)\n\u00a0 New research suggests that unless we rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions we will have to extract far more CO2 from the atmosphere than we are technically prepared for.

{"id": null, "body": "     As World Water Week draws to a close, water and climate expert Jens Berggren explains why climate change is already affecting our precious H2O. DW: Can you explain the correlation between climate change and water? Jens Berggren: That is actually a really big question, and it's hard to answer, because it's more a case of what is not the correlation. The teeth of climate change, how it will be experienced by people and plants and animals on our planet, that is to a very large extent, through water. It's changing the way water moves on our planet and how it behaves. Already today, some 90 percent of all natural disasters are water related; between 1992 and 2012, water related disasters affected 4.2 billion people. And the predictions for the future are that these\u00a0 extreme weather \u00a0events will increase in both frequency and intensity. You say the behavior of water has changed, can you illustrate how? That any individual event is due to climate change, is very hard to prove scientifically, you can only say the likelihood of these of types of events occurring has increased with climate change. The only sign of vegetation in this part of New South Wales is a lone tree Read more : \u00a0 India's 'water man' keeping liquids flowing despite crisis You can see it in many places. One thing, for example, is that we had a drought this summer; we had temperatures of over 30 degrees within the Arctic Circle. This is unheard of. Take Cape Town, they had no winter rains for three years and according to statisticians, that should only happen once every 1,000 years. Now it happened. And there have been huge droughts in\u00a0 Australia,\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0especially in New South Wales, where they've had to cull their herds. To what extent does climate change have an impact on our drinking water? This is the really hard part. When we simplify it, we say there are only three problems with water, you can have too much, too little, or too dirty. The problem with climate change is that when we have these extreme weather events, when the huge flood \u00a0comes, that's when most of the waste on the land surfaces are flushed out into our water bodies. So, having too much water causes too dirty water. The other side of that coin is that when you don't have enough water, when you're in a drought, there's actually less water to dilute the pollutants already in it. This means that both too much and too little lead to too dirty. And that is the third dangerous leg of the water challenge, and it is going to be one of the main issues. Is it there enough freshwater to sustain the global population? There is 3 percent fresh water, but 2 percent of that is locked in ice caps, so there's just 1 percent left. And out of that 1 percent, almost all of it is very deep down water that we cannot really reach. The estimates are that 0.07 percent of the total water volume on planet earth is accessible to humans and other terrestrial beings. The OECD estimates that the demand for water will increase 55 percent by 2050. I think one of the main things from the world water week this year is that the era of stable abundance is over. We will not be able to go along as we have been doing, we need to be far smarter and wiser in the way we use and manage our water resources. Climate experts are warning that flooding will become more frequent in years to come How do we make what we have go far enough? There's no doubt about it, if we look at how water is being used over the world, we are so incredibly inefficient in very many ways. It might not be easy, but if we set our minds to it, we could reduce our water use by almost half, and that would give ample opportunity to meet all our needs. But we need to manage it, we need to govern it well, because I think that is where the problem is, it's not a lack of water per se, it's a lack of water governance. How is the water we have being misused? Farming and irrigation of our crops takes some 70 percent of the total water resource in the world, but it's often hugely inefficient, so you waste a lot of water in irrigation. And about a third of all food that's produced is lost, either in the fields to pests and other things, or we throw it away after we have bought it. Read more :\u00a0 Climate change takes a toll on our minds, too We need to change the way we govern our water. I think this a discussion that people should have in every country knowing that we are facing huge water challenges. We need to have a political discussion on how we want to use our water, in what economic activities do we want to invest our water resources, then build the governance structures around that. This year's drought has been crippling for farmers across Germany Thinking about solutions, is there a place for startups, initiatives that operate on a small scale? Absolutely. We're at the stage right now where we cannot afford to lose any good ideas. It's very hard to know what ideas might be good before we've tried them out, and one of the things I have learnt in my almost 28-year career in water research, is that you never know what solution will work where. Some things work perfectly in one area and then in the next village or city, the circumstances aren't right. We need to be willing to experiment and try different things out, and if they're good, they will grow to scale. Which parts of the world are especially stressed as a result of water shortage of the potential for it? Some countries have very little water. Take Yemen for example, they are in huge troubles with their water supply, but they have a far longer tradition of managing scarce water resources, of living under water scarcity. If we in Sweden got a\u00a0 reduction in our water supply \u00a0that wasn't even close to what Yemen experiences on a good year, we would have big problems, because we have not designed our societies for that situation. Water management is key to ensuring it is not wasted Read more :\u00a0 More hot years ahead, study says In places you know you will have water challenges, in most cases, people have at least started to think about it, so they are slightly prepared. But it's the places where you have no thought this would happen. That is where the calamity will be worse. Jens Berggren is a water and climate expert and Director of Communications at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) He previously worked as Director of the Stockholm Water Prize and Stockholm Industry Water Award, and advisor on International Processes. The interview was conducted by Tamsin Walker, and has been edited for length and clarity.  Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, addressing the drought in the state of New South Wales, which produces one-quarter of the country's agricultural output, said, \"Now we are the land of drought.\" Australia recently passed legislation to provide hundreds of millions of dollars worth of relief aid to farmers, including funds for mental health support. Ethiopia has been suffering from ongoing drought conditions since 2015, causing massive food shortages. The Ethiopian government said that some 8.5 million citizens required emergency food assistance in 2017 and that nearly 400,000 infants suffered acute malnutrition. Furthermore, the drought threatens to end traditional nomadic herding in the region. Conservation and late-season rains saved South Africa's Cape Town from an apocalyptic Day Zero scenario, in which water would have to be turned off and emergency rations issued, The drought, which was one of the worst in decades, emptied water reservoirs and caused some experts to suggest hauling icebergs from Antarctica avert a crisis. Europe's sweltering heat has been compounded by a lack of rain. Not only have citizens been suffering the health consequences, which affect health care systems and labor productivity, crops have also been hit hard. Farmers across the continent fear bankruptcy due to poor crops and the EU Joint Research Center predicts \"an increase in drought frequency and intensity in the future.\" Greece has been facing the dual problem of flash flooding in some regions and drought in others. Crete's farmers said they could lose up to 40 percent of their crop this year due to an extremely dry winter. Though they are watering, they say it is not enough to nourish their crops. Water levels are so low that previously submerged villages have begun to reappear in reservoirs across the country. Sweden, which has not seen rain for over three months, is experiencing its worst drought since 1944. The situation threatens to cause severe crop losses costing farmers hundreds of thousands of euros. Sweden has been the site of massive forest fires and has even seen temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Arctic Circle. The United Kingdom fears serious threats to its food supply chain due to the effects of this summer's drought. The country's National Farmers Union said the country is experiencing \"tinderbox conditions.\" This adds to problems brought on by the prospect of needed self-reliance in the event of a no-deal Brexit. India has been plagued by water shortages due to rising population and mismanagement but also aggravated by drought, causing many areas of the country to run out of water. Bangalore was recently added to the list of global cities most likely to run out of drinking water. Other cities on the list include Cape Town, South Africa; Jakarta, Indonesia and Sao Paolo, Brazil. The US government said 29 percent of the country is currently experiencing drought, with conditions affecting some 75 million people. Although wildfires in California have captured the world's attention, farming states, like Kansas, have once again been suffering. Kansas was one of the states crippled by the famous 1930s Dust Bowl.

{"id": null, "body": "     Despite the urgency of a \"climate emergency\" we're nowhere near fulfilling the Paris agreement. Why are we so reluctant to act? Climate psychologist Per Espen Stoknes says we need to move away from pointing blame. DW: Why are we so reluctant to act to halt global warming ? Per Espen Stoknes: We have several \"brain challenges\"\u00a0when it comes to dealing with the abstract, slow moving, invisible threat of climate change. It doesn't really trigger our \"evolutionary risk lamps.\" Since it's invisible and often described very abstractly, people distance themselves from it.\u00a0Unemployment, crime, immigration seem closer to me and hence I give the climate threat a lower priority than those things that feel nearer. So does that mean that we actually have to experience problems of climate change firsthand before we will take action? That may certainly help, but we also know that even people who have been exposed to floods or hurricanes prefer to focus on rebuilding what they have and getting back to business as usual. This has to do with the way we prefer to protect ourselves from threatening facts rather than changing ourselves. So we need to bring the facts across in a way that helps people to acknowledge them. Then it gets people out of the need to defend themselves, as if climate science was a threat to who we are. So how do we do that? If we say the Earth is now going to hell, we're going to a boiling Earth, a hothouse, and you keep saying that, it activates a barrier we call the doom barrier. When you have heard this too many times, you get used to it. You start to avoid the messenger and the message and you may even want to stereotype the messenger. These are just tree huggers or green extremists or climate fanatics. Are we not just deceiving ourselves if we try to block out the negative effects of climate change? In a way, yes. But it is just the way the human brain works. We have lots of studies that show how people tend to disengage and the reason is fear and guilt feelings, which tend to be evoked by the \"doom framing,\" and then we start to shut down. These are feelings that make us passive not active. We know from psychotherapy that just shaming people or making them feel guilty does not enhance the willingness to change. People start to avoid those messages and people who make them feel bad. So what's your advice as a psychologist on communicating climate change in a way that will take us forward? Rather than speaking about PPM levels (parts per million, calculation of CO2 in the atmosphere) and melting ice, I would like to hear about other people like me and my neighbors or colleagues or somebody else I would identify with. If I see my neighbor getting solar panels or an electric car, then I will want one, too. If\u00a0I believe most people in my city are now taking action, then I would want to do so too, because we are social animals. We have developed in flocks for millions of years. And when I see somebody like me do something, that feels much nearer, much more personal and urgent than listening to climate science speaking about the year 2100 or melting Arctic ice far away. So we have to make it cool to use renewable energies for instance? [It has to be]\u00a0a part of the new normal in the 21st century that we have lower ecological footprints together with other people who live close by. So we're giving climate science local and social context. We also need to work on making it simpler for people to know what products to buy in the shop or what is the climate effect of a car or household appliance. So we just do the right thing by default. We do not speak about catastrophe, about cost and sacrifice all the time, but rather speak about the health benefits of low-emission lifestyles; how it\u00a0is safer and better for us in terms of reducing risks to do something today. So the coolness of using electric bikes or a smarter house that regulates its temperatures and light depending on whether we are home or not. Benefits of local jobs in better insulation and renewable energy generation. The health benefits and the risk improvements should be emphasized at least three times as much as the threats. Can Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement be a tipping point? Previously students couldn't do much, but with the climate strikes, they now can. We know that social tipping points happen when there is between 25 and 50 percent, a committed minority working at it. Then that coincides with an event that may be hard to predict and then suddenly \u2014\u00a0based on all these years of working hard to shift attitudes but seemingly getting nowhere \u2014 then sort of tipping points happen.\u00a0 So which psychological factors do you think kicked off the Fridays for Future movement? One school of social science has been analyzing historic events that have led to social tipping points. One is like Rosa Parks when she did her sit down strike for the black [community] on public buses in\u00a0the US. Or the Vietnam War where everybody was perceived as unpatriotic if there were not for it. But then came this photo of the girl running from the napalm bombing and suddenly the social tipping point happened. These kind of events were utterly unpredictable. So I don't think there are any communication experts or campaign strategists who would have come up with using a 15-year-old Swedish girl with Asperger as the frontrunner of the new climate communication. So can Greta Thunberg be another example where we have been working for years and then suddenly something unexpected \u2014 and somehow like a media sensation \u2014 comes along and changes the long term trajectory? We do know there is a committed minority varying from country to country between say 15 percent to 40 percent of people who are very concerned about climate change. So the condition seems to be there for a sort of tipping point to happen. But I must admit as a scientist we truly do not know if this just a wave or whether it's a genuine tipping point. How is the movement affecting older generations psychologically? Basically the blame is being pointed quite clearly in their/our direction? Yes, and blaming tends to reinforce the barriers,\u00a0the defenses we have. When you start to blame the older generation, [they]\u00a0start\u00a0to shoot back. So they say things like \"well now we expect you to stop asking for new mobile phones. We don't have to drive you around to your activities, and you won't want to come on vacation with us, and you don't want any new clothes either.\" And that\u00a0does not enhance in-depth change at all. It just reinforces the need for people to defend their own position. We have to focus on what we get more of \u2014 which is better human lives with smarter resource use. Humans are emotional beings and if we only try to play on fear and guilt \u2014\u00a0 or [only play] to the rational mind, we will not reach people's hearts and not give people a story that comes with a sense of community that we are in this together. I'm hoping for a plurality of stories on how we [transform] towards a low carbon and high quality of life society. The first is a story of a genuine green growth. Another story is that more consumption of resources doesn't make us more happy. But what we do know makes us more happy is meaningful work, social relationships and a sense of dignity in the community with others. Third I see the emergence of a story focusing on stewardship rather than domination of nature. And the fourth story has to do with what I call \"rewilding\": that we find ways of strengthening nature again, investing in the ecosystem, cleaning rivers to become drinkable again and we can have animals coming back in the forests, so the ecosystems regain their vitality side by side with the cities. Per Espen Stoknes is a climate psychologist and economist. He is Director of the Center for Green Growth at the Norwegian Business School in Oslo, and author of several books, including \"What we think about when we try not to think about global warming. Towards a new psychology of climate action.\" Of the 2 million-odd people who visit the Great Barrier Reef annually, a 2016 survey found that 69 percent were coming to see the UNESCO World Heritage site \"before it's too late.\" And no wonder. The IPCC says that even if we manage to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, 99 percent of the world's coral will be wiped out. Tourists can hasten their demise by touching or polluting reefs. And what's the carbon cost of flying to remote natural wonders under threat? A 2010 study found that the business of polar-bear safaris in Churchill, Canada, had an annual CO2 footprint of 20 megatons. Most visitors arrived by plane, and while 88 percent of them said humans were responsible for climate change, only 69 percent agreed that air travel was a contributing cause. Along with the polar bear, one of the most iconic images of climate change must be the dramatic curves of an iceberg sculpted by the warming atmosphere. Gliding between the melting giants on a cruise ship is a haunting experience that tourists will pay huge sums for. In the early 1990s just 5,000 people visited Antarctica each year, compared to over 46,000 in 2018. You don't have to go to the poles to see vanishing ice. Kilimanjaro's snowy peaks are a striking sight above the equatorial savannah of the national park, which generates \u20ac44 million ($50 million) from tourism annually. Many visitors climb to the Furtw\u00e4ngler Glacier \u2014 where 85 percent of the ice has vanished over the last century. The rest is unlikely to survive much beyond mid-century. When Montana's Glacier National Park opened in 1910, it boasted over 100 of the ice features from which it took its name. Now, there are fewer than two dozen. So dramatic is their retreat, that the park has become a center of climate science research. Some 3 million hikers and holidaymakers also visit the \"crown of the continent\" each year, soaking in the dying days of its ice-capped glory. The Maldives are the archetypal tourist paradise: 1,200 coral islands with white beaches rising just 2.5 meters above the turquoise waters. In 2017, the president decided to build new airports and megaresorts to accommodate seven times as many tourists, and use the revenue to build new islands and relocate communities.

{"id": null, "body": "     German farmers are no strangers to the elements, but this summer has brought home the realities of climate change, and the need to start adapting. How can farmers adapt to the changing conditions? Carved into a block of wood and given pride of place in the parlor of an old farmhouse 100 or so kilometers (around 62 miles) northwest of Berlin, is a quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe : Was du ererbt von deinen V\u00e4tern hast, erwirb es, um es zu besitzen . From his place at the head of a solid wooden table, farmer Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen recites the words that were also a feature of his western German childhood home.\u00a0 Loosely translated, they mean: To own your inheritance,\u00a0you have to use it well. He interprets them as a reminder of his \"duty\" to tend the land in his custody with such care, that when it passes to his children, it is in better condition than when he took it on. Read more:  Germany swelters under heat wave As a young man, Gr\u00fcnhagen left Lower Saxony and the family farm that dates back to the year 936 and has been running his own place in Germany's former East for almost three decades. During that time, he has seen changes, not only to his farm and the lively village where it's located, but to the country's political, societal and, increasingly, climate landscape . \"I'm not talking about the extremes, because we've always had them,\" he told DW, \"but about the growing period, which now starts earlier in the spring, even when we have a late winter like this one, when it was still very cold in January and February.\" Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen comes from a long line of farmers. He says the changing climate is having an impact on his crops Fatal frosts and punishing heat His is an arable farm of 1,300 hectares (3,212 acres) \u2014 part conventional, part organic \u2014 that grows 19 crop varieties including grains, peas, hemp, Jerusalem artichokes and corn. One of his signature plants is the humble potato, which has struggled to survive in this summer of no rain and temperatures edging towards 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). \"Potatoes don't like temperatures above 25 degrees, they stop growing properly,\" he said, adding that he invested in an irrigation system a few years ago. \"It doesn't stop the heat, but at least it keeps the plants alive.\" Where possible, he has begun to switch to varieties that lend themselves to warmer weather. But even that hasn't worked this year. \"We planted corn, but it was so dry that it didn't even germinate. The field is empty.\" For those crops that do germinate, there is still the very real threat of late spring frosts heavy enough to wipe out young plants that have been seduced into premature existence by unnaturally warm daytime temperatures. \"Grains start to grow earlier than they used to, the ear might already be in the stalk when there's a night frost,\" he said. \"That means the ear dies and you're left with nothing.\" Gr\u00fcnhagen's main crop is the potato. The edible tuber doesn't do well in high temperatures From the grain to the grape Hundreds of kilometers south-west, in the wine growing region of Rhein-Hesse, vigneron Adolf Dahlem is looking for ways to overcome similar challenges that he says are \"undeniably\" linked to climate change . \"The first really bad year was 2003. Nothing but sun for months on end,\" he told DW. \"We've had several early and warm years since then, and the gaps between them are getting shorter and shorter.\" Though unremitting sunshine might sound like a wine grower's dream, it's more complex than that. Apart from the same problems of plants that produce shoots before the fatal frost season is over, vignerons in the region are grappling with new strains of pests and ever earlier harvests. Read more:  Climate change and farming: 'Unpredictability is here to stay' When Dahlem was a child, the grapes were picked in October. But in recent years, the annual event has moved into September and even August. \"This early harvest goes hand-in-hand with high temperatures,\" he said. And therein lies the problem. \"If we're harvesting when it's around 30 C, the grapes and the must will also have a temperature of 30 degrees.\" Though Dahlem tries to harvest at night and in the early morning when the fruit is cooler, it takes \"a highly technological and energy-intensive process\" to keep the grapes at the right temperature to achieve \"the unique harmony of fruit and acidity\" for which the region's riesling is famed. Wine growers are dealing with vines that produce shoots earlier, leaving them vulnerable to frosts Some growers see an opportunity to experiment with different grape sorts to make red wines atypical for the region, but Dahlem says there's a real desire in the community to find ways to keep on producing top-quality riesling. \"We will try to adapt,\" he said. \"But it is really very hard to meet the market's expectations.\" From the ground up And that is becoming a common refrain. Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen anticipates a 50 percent drop in yield this year. \"It has consequences for the agricultural industry, for those who buy our grain or the starch factory that processes our potatoes.\" All he can do, he says, is to try and adapt to the changing conditions, to be selective in the crops he sows, to irrigate where possible, and to ensure his soil is as healthy as it can be. For the chairman of the German Federation of the Organic Food Industry (B\u00d6LW), Felix zu L\u00f6wenstein, the state of Germany's farming land is a pressing issue.\u00a0 He believes the country's agricultural system has been due a complete rethink for some time, but that climate change brings the need for a \"radical\" overhaul into even sharper relief.\u00a0 Citing the increasing incidence of extreme weather events such as drought and heavy rainfall, he says it's untenable to \"pretend that everything has to stay as it was, and from time to time ask for some public money to keep us alive.\" Read more:  Heat wave challenges German wine industry as it eyes changing trends He sees soil fertility, increased humus content and reduced soil compaction \u2014 both of which make it easier for the ground to absorb and store water \u2014 increased biodiversity and crop rotation as potential measures for long-term change. Many farmers have hit back at him for vocalizing these thoughts at a time when the relentless heat of the past months has filled many with an existential angst. \"They take it as a reproach,\" he said, \"and it makes me sad because that's the last thing I want to do.\" Rethinking European farming What he does want though, is to use the extremity of this summer as a catalyst for an earnest discussion about the future. He sees EU plans to rework its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) by 2020 as an opportunity to stop paying subsidies on the current per hectare basis under which large farms stand to benefit the most. \"We have to switch to a policy where farmers are paid for a service they're providing,\" he said. \"For measures that increase biodiversity, that make farming and food production more resilient.\" Experts say Germany and Europe's agricultural system needs a radical overhaul to deal with the impact of climate change Read more:  Opinion: The German farmers who moan until the cows come home Gr\u00fcnhagen, however, fears that a loss of the current subsidy system would lead to fallow land. \"In this region, we have light soil which means the earning potential is relatively low,\" he said, adding that the subsidies are a lifeline for many farmers. Without them, he predicts summers where \"large swathes of brown land\" stretch across the country because farmers would simply give up. He hopes it won't come to that, and for his part, vows to continue adapting and tending his land in keeping with his interpretation of Goethe's words, and with enough care to ensure there is something to pass onto the next generation. Even in the face of climate change. Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen has an arable farm a 90-minute drive north of Berlin. He says he has noticed climate change in the extended growing period of his crops. While even a few years ago, he had to harvest his potatoes by early October, he says that has changed, because the frosts no longer arrive as early in the year. Gr\u00fcnhagen expects to get at least this number of potatoes from each plant, but because they wither in temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit), keeping them healthy is not easy. The only option he has is to water them. Even so, this summer of extreme heat means he's looking at half his usual yield. He grows many different kinds of grain and says nothing about their harvest time has changed. Still, they sprout and grow earlier, making them more vulnerable to late frosts, which have not been eradicated by climate change. Where possible, he is now switching to crop varieties that can cope with more sun. Vintners are facing similar problems. In western Germany, warmer daytime temperatures in North Rhine-Westphalia's (NRW) wine-growing region coax vines into producing buds earlier than they used to. As with other plants, that makes them vulnerable on nights when the temperature falls below zero degrees Celsius. As they're particularly sensitive, once they've been bitten, they tend to die. Long summers of extreme heat also make the grapes ripen much earlier, meaning they have to be harvested earlier. The higher temperatures affect their taste. But keeping them cool enough during the wine-making process requires a huge technological effort. When possible, vintners try to pick the grapes in the middle of the night or in the early morning before they've absorbed the warmth of the day. Some in the NRW wine-making community see the changing weather patterns as an opportunity to experiment with growing grape sorts that previously couldn't have weathered the German climate. But they don't want to lose their long-standing reputation for producing the white wines for which the region has become globally well-known. There are calls from within Germany's farming community to rethink the country's entire food production system and to put more emphasis on improving the quality of the ground on which the nation relies. Measures such as planting more trees and bushes to stop drying winds, and preventing excessive soil compaction through the use of heavy machines could help. Healthy soil, says Felix zu L\u00f6wenstein, Chairman of the German Federation of the Organic Food Industry, has much to do with how much humus and how much life exists within it. The higher the content, the greater the soil's ability to absorb water, making it more resilient both in times of drought and extreme rainfall. Author: Tamsin Walker Earth's population is soaring, demand for more resource-intensive foods shows no sign of abating and climate change threatens to make farming in many regions even tougher. Growing plants without soil could be a solution.

{"id": null, "body": "     Countries that are least responsible for causing climate change are the ones suffering most from its effects, especially regarding food insecurity and nutrient deficiencies, reports show. Scientists warn we must act now. For years now, environmentalists and scientists have been\u00a0warning that poorer countries with very low carbon footprints are bearing the brunt of\u00a0carbon dioxide emissions in the wealthy world. A\u00a0recent report by the British development charity Christian Aid brings the drama of that\u00a0inequality into sharp relief. Hunger Strike: The Climate and Food Vulnerability Index \u00a0found\u00a0that the 10 most food-insecure countries in the world generate less than half a ton of CO2 per person. Collectively, they generate just 0.08% of total global CO2. \"What really surprised and shocked me was how strong the negative correlation was between food poverty and very low per capita emission,\"\u00a0Katherine Kramer, an author of the report\u00a0told DW. \"It was much stronger than we expected.\" Topping the index is\u00a0Burundi which at just 0.027 tons\u00a0has the lowest per capita emissions of any country. The\u00a0figure is so low, in fact, it is often rounded down to zero. By comparison, the average German, American and Saudi generates the same amount of\u00a0CO2 as 359, 583 and 719 Burundians respectively. As highlighted in\u00a0 the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u00a0report, one of the primary threats to human life as a result of climate change, is food insecurity \u2014 especially\u00a0in the global south, where people rely on small-scale agriculture and are more vulnerable to droughts, flooding\u00a0and extreme weather. In Burundi, which is\u00a0already facing food insecurity as a result of political unrest,\u00a0and where the prevalence of chronic malnutrition is the highest in the world, changing weather patterns are a major cause for concern. Rainfall in the East African state\u00a0has become very\u00a0sporadic over the past three years, particularly in\u00a0some agriculture-heavy regions, and the\u00a0report predicts that extreme flooding\u00a0and droughts will result in a yield decline of between five and 25% in coming decades. \"Burundi is a living testament to the injustice of the climate crisis,\" Philip Galgallo, Christian Aid's Country Director for Burundi wrote in the report.\u00a0\"Despite producing almost no carbon emissions, we find\u00a0ourselves on the front line of climate change, suffering from higher temperatures, lower crop yields and increasingly unreliable rains.\" It's a similar story in the second most food insecure country in the world: the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which also has the second smallest carbon footprint. Temperatures there are rising fast\u00a0imply an increased risk in livestock and crop disease, and rainfall patterns are changing, leaving\u00a0Congolese farmers unsure about when to plant and when to harvest.\u00a0\u00a0 Risk of nutrient deficiencies But climate change doesn't only impact crop yields and our ability to grow food. CO2 also has a direct effect on crop nutrients.\u00a0 A recent study in the scientific journal, Lancet Planetary Health looked at how climate change and rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are reducing the nutrient content of staple food crops, like rice, wheat, corn and soy. Close to 50 percent of the world's calories come from these grains. Extreme floods and droughts in Burundi are estimated to reduce long-term GDP growth by 2.4 percent per year The study found that over the next 30 years the availability of critical nutrients for human health, including iron, protein, and zinc, could be significantly reduced\u00a0if we continue with our current rate of\u00a0emissions.\u00a0\u00a0 \"You'll find a 14 to 20 percent reduction in the global availability of iron,\u00a0zinc and protein in our diet,\"\u00a0study author Seth Myers told DW. And the implications of this reduction are very significant. Over the next 30 years, critical nutrients like protein, iron and zinc could significantly reduce \"Iron and zinc deficiency today already cause somewhere around 60 million life years to be lost annually, so they are already the cause of very large global burdens of disease today,\"\u00a0Myers told DW. \"As a result of rising CO2 levels, hundreds of millions of people will fall into life threatening risks of zinc and protein deficiencies and close to a billion people who already have those deficiencies would have them exacerbated.\" Such\u00a0deficiencies\u00a0increase\u00a0child mortality from\u00a0diseases and illnesses like malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea.\u00a0 Moral crisis The people most affected will be\u00a0in the global south, Myers says, because those at the highest risk of these nutritional deficiencies are the people that have the least diverse diets and least intake of animal-sourced foods, such as meat, milk, eggs, cheese and yogurt. \"And that's sort of ironic because those are the people who are\u00a0least responsible for emitting the carbon dioxide that's making their food less nutritious,\" Myers said.\u00a0\u00a0 Climate change has a disproportionate impact on communities which depend on the natural environment for their day-to-day needs. In Eritrea, it's estimated about 80% of the population are subsistence farmers, mainly growing sorghum, maize and teff. Such subsistence farmers are especially vulnerable to shifting weather patterns that can devastate food production and livelihoods. During the past few years, Eritrea, like the rest of the Horn of Africa, has experienced fluctuating weather patterns exacerbated by the ocean warming trend, El Ni\u00f1o. Rains fell unexpectedly in Eritrea in October last year resulting in the government advising farmers to reap early. \"Had they not reacted, or reacted based on the traditional harvest, they would probably lose their harvest,\" says Peter Smerdon with the World Food Programme. While El Ni\u00f1o is a complex and naturally occurring event, scientific research suggests that global warming could be making this cyclical event occur more frequently and intensely. Most of the world\u2019s scientific communities agree that long-term significant changes in the earth\u2019s climate system have occurred and are occurring more rapidly than in the past. Continued emissions into the earth\u2019s atmosphere are projected to cause further warming, impacting Africa in the form of increased temperatures and greater seasonal rainfall variability with more frequent extremes. \"People in wealthier countries should be worried about the effects of climate change in the Horn of Africa,\" says Challiss McDonough from the World Food Programme \"Climate change is one of the main drivers of global hunger, second only to conflict, so, for donor countries, investing in climate and disaster risk reduction makes economic sense.\" Pictured on the local Eritrean 5-Nakfa banknote, the sycamore tree has significant symbolism in Eritrea. Elders used to gather under these huge, hundred-year-old trees to discuss important community issues and laws. Many trees were cut down during colonization and war. Those that remain now have to contend with the effects of climate change. \"One impact of climate change in a coastal region is rising sea levels that impact lives along the coast and increases the likelihood of flooding or flood-related disaster such as high tides that could wash out a crop,\" Smerdon says. \"Also, salt-water intrusion due to climate change can increase erosion and increase salinity of soils and thereby damage soil content and fertility of land.\" Eritrea\u2019s stunning coastline includes coral reefs, offering a potential boon for tourism \u2013 if they survive in their present state. \"Until a few years ago, this piece of sea was full of corals, but then last year they all died,\u201d an Eritrean diver tells DW. \"The temperature of the sea was too high.\" At the same time, local fisherman rely on the ocean's resources to trade in fish and shells. The weather pattern changes in Eritrea are evident elsewhere. \"While working in Central America, East Africa, and the Middle East, I\u2019ve always talked to elder people, especially those in agriculture, and the message from them is consistent,\" says Sam Wood with Save the Children in Ethiopia. \"Weather patterns are becoming less predictable and when rain comes, it is too much or too little.\u201d Author: James Jeffrey, Milena Belloni He describes it as both a public health emergency and a\u00a0moral crisis. \"There is no excuse for not acting with the utmost urgency when it's our emissions of the wealthy world that are putting the poorest people on the planet in harm's way.\" Responsibility to act Kramer says\u00a0there are a number of measures the developed world needs to take to address food insecurity and help tackle climate change. \"The first and most important is to cut their own emissions drastically and very quickly,\" she said. \"We can retreat indoors, with our fans and air conditioning. \u00a0We have access to water supplies to help cool off. It hasn't hit us in the same way yet, but it is already hitting the developing world.\" Myers agrees.\u00a0\"We've got to stop burning fossil fuels, we have to transition to renewables and away from carbon dioxide emissions as fast as we possibly can and we have to feel that moral urgency behind that transition,\"\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u00a0 Another important step is to grant support for developing nations. Kramer says this can be financial or in the form of\u00a0 access to technology and education , particularly when it comes to early warning systems that allow countries to see\u00a0when a disaster is coming so they can prepare for it. Another step is to help developing states to enhance their resilience and productivity. \"Why study, if our future is being destroyed?\" This sign features a sentiment shared by increasing numbers of German students, who have joined young people worldwide in using Friday school strikes to call for action on climate change. The movement was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began her protests alone in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. With the 2015 Paris climate accord, nearly all of the world's countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), by 2100. The hope is that this target will prevent the worst effects of climate disasters. Concerned by the dire predictions from climate scientists, more and more people have called for immediate action. Despite urgent warnings, politicians have dragged their heels on important climate decisions. It's become clear that Germany will miss its targets for 2020. Climate protection was an important factor in the European elections in late May, with the Greens winning more than 20% of the vote in Germany alone, more than double previous results. Among 18-24-year-olds, 34% backed the party. Germany's climate movement is fighting on many fronts. In recent years, activists have fought to preserve Hambach Forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, building treehouses to prevent the old-growth forest from being felled to make way for the mining of lignite, or brown coal. Energy giant RWE has launched legal action, and police have cleared the camp several times. In September 2018, a few days after the camp was removed again, a court ruling suspended the clearing of the forest until late 2020, after a lawsuit by environmental group BUND. RWE has argued that the forest has to be cut in order to ensure the coal necessary for Germany's electricity supply. Around 50,000 activists celebrated the victory. Protests organized by groups such as Ende Gel\u00e4nde have increasingly been making headlines. Thousands of young activists have come out to staged events, blocking railway tracks used to deliver coal to power plants near Cologne and occupying huge coal excavators, as seen here in the open-pit mine in the east German town of Welzow in 2016. In January 2019, after seven months of negotiations, a coal commission set up by the federal government to work out Germany's plans to phase out coal power released its findings. It recommended that Germany should continue coal mining until 2038, at the latest \u2014far too late for the country to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris climate accord. An increasing number of young people in Germany are demanding that the government find a way to meet the 1.5-degree target. The emerging Fridays for Future movement has been getting support from longtime environmentalists, teachers, academics and parents. They have called for all German coal-fired power plants to be shut down by 2030, and for renewable energy initiatives to be vastly expanded. Author: Gero Rueter Through the Paris Climate Agreement, almost\u00a0all developed countries in the world have already committed to provide\u00a0resources to help developing nations\u00a0combat the effects of climate change, but there are no penalties in place for those that don't honor their\u00a0promises. That's why Kramer believes people need to put pressure on their governments to make good on the pledges. \"If we don't clean up our emissions and solve the climate crisis as a global community, then those climate impacts are going to get worse and worse, and millions of lives are at stake.\" Conflict, climate change and weak economic growth are leaving more people without enough to eat, a UN report warning of starvation and famine says.

P\u00f6rtner said all the IPCC scientists were agreed: \"If you go above 1.5 degrees (Celsius: 1.7 F) of global warming compared to the preindustrial age, the repercussions get more and more dangerous.\" And, the longer we delay taking action, the harder it will be to achieve this target. \"In the 1990s, the EU was the first to realize that the rise in temperature had to be kept below 2 degrees,\" said Wolfgang Obergassel, a researcher in international climate policy at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy. \"It then took another 10 years to convince the rest of the world.\" At the UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen in 2009, the international community agreed that global warming should not increase by more than 2 degrees. \"In the meantime, though, climate science had become more advanced,\" Obergassel told DW. \"It was clear that a 2-degree rise would also cause serious harm.\" Developing countries that will suffer most from climate change are piling on the pressure. Small island states facing potential obliteration were especially instrumental in getting the ambitious 1.5-degree target enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement. \"That was a compromise. It's a round figure. The political negotiations thus settled on 1.5 degrees,\" Obergassel said.

According to the analysis published by the IPCC last year, \"We'll hit 1.5 degrees between 2030 and 2052,\" P\u00f6rtner said. \"That's what the climate models say \u2014\u00a0although these are only approximations.\" So, if countries don't act fast enough, the Earth may already be 1.5 degrees warmer as early as 2030. The fact that the climate models only provide approximations is one reason why there are so many different prognoses. It also depends on which reference values are used.

When the Scottish engineer James Watt refined the steam engine in the late 18th century, setting off the process of industrialization, at first in Britain, no one knew that this was also the start of human-caused climate change. Since then, we have been pumping ever greater quantities of carbon dioxide into the air. The US climatologist Michael M. Mann estimates that the world may already have warmed by 0.2 degrees in the first 100 years of industrialization to 1870. One early trigger of human-caused climate change: James Watt's steam engine The climatologists have taken the period 1850-1900 as a basis for comparison when making the current calculations about global warming. Since the end of the 19th century, carbon dioxide emissions have risen faster and faster as a consequence of increasingly widespread technical development and global industrialization. The IPCC assumes that the global temperature has increased by about 1 degree since 1850 because of man-made greenhouse gases. That is a probable median figure; as all calculations are only approximations, the possible range is between 0.8 and 1.2 degrees. Read more: \u00a0 Is Netflix bad for the environment?

The IPCC has calculated that the world has to become carbon-neutral by 2040 to have a good chance of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees. But in order to achieve that target there will have to be a consistent reduction in emissions worldwide, starting next year. \"That may be a rather idealistic undertaking, from today's point of view,\" says P\u00f6rtner. \"It relies on the big emitters, like the United States, China or India, also massively reducing their emissions from 2020 onwards.\" At the moment, global emissions are still rising year on year. \"But even 1.5 degrees is no safe haven,\" P\u00f6rtner adds. \"And, of course, the sooner we do something about this, the easier it will be for us later on.\" Read more: \u00a0 Climate emergency: New hope, or just empty words? Parts of European countries, such as here in France, have been experiencing unusually dry conditions Political decision-making in 2020 \"It was stipulated that another review should be done between 2018 and 2020 to see whether countries could contribute more,\"\u00a0says Wolfgang Obergassel, who has been monitoring the international climate talks for many years. After 2020, the plan is to continue negotiations before setting new, more ambitious targets in 2025. \"You can indeed say that if nothing happens by 2020, more ambitious targets probably won't be very high on the political agenda any more for a few years,\" he says It will still be possible to save the climate after 2020, says the IPCC's Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner. However: \"The longer we wait, the more drastic measures we will have to take.\u201d So Prince Charles is right to be urging countries to implement effective climate protection as fast as possible. Although there is a combination of factors behind the numerous jellyfish that reach vacation havens like the Mediterranean coast, climate change is also partially to blame. Warmer sea temperatures are opening up new areas where jellyfish can reproduce, and increasing the availability of their favorite food: plankton. Prized for their superior sound quality, an original Stradivarius can sell for millions of dollars. Yet, extreme weather events, such as unusually violent storms, are killing millions of trees, putting at risk the famous wood in the Paneveggio forest, in northern Italy. Replanting trees won't help much in the short term. A spruce has to be at least 150 years old before it can become a violin. On very hot nights, people sleep worse, especially in big cities. By 2050 European metropolises may experience temperatures around 3.5 degrees Celsius warmer in summer. It not only affects sleep, but also mood, productivity and mental health. The only way to escape is to move to smaller towns and settlements, where the nights are cooler since there are fewer buildings and more greenery. Spring is starting earlier in the year due to global warmer temperatures \u2014 bad news for allergy sufferers. With a longer frost-free season, plants have more time to grow, bloom and produce pollen. Therefore, pollen will freely roam around much earlier, which will make the suffering season longer and the annual pollen load greater. Will it be the century of masks for air pollution and allergies? Heat not only makes us sweat; it also affects our health. By the end of this century three-quarters of the world's population is expected to be exposed to dangerous and deadly heat waves. Rising temperatures mean an increase in diarrheal diseases, as it's easier for bacteria to multiply in warm food and water. Mosquito numbers will also likely go up, along with the spread of diseases like malaria. Soil in the region around the North Pole is increasingly thawing in the summer months, with dramatic local and global consequences. Warmer temperatures cause floors to become unstable and houses and roads to crack, and leads to many more insects. Moreover, if permafrost \u2014 frozen soil \u2014 melts, it will release CO2 and methane gases that could further exacerbate global warming. It's a vicious circle. Temperature can influence the sex of several species. For sea turtles, the heat of the sand where the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the newborn. Low temperatures benefit male turtles, while females develop better in warmer areas. Researchers have found that over 99% of turtle hatchlings in northern Australia are already female, making it difficult for the species to survive.

The current problem with our energy system is that there are peak hours during which everybody wants to use electricity. During these peaks, power plants have to purchase extra energy from producers to meet the demand, and they're purchasing it at a loss. By facilitating better communication and an exchange of information between utility companies and consumers, our startup aims to reduce both the energy use at the consumer-end and the energy storage at the production-end, saving both parties money and reducing CO2. Creating more awareness on both our consumption and creation of energy is a key to making the whole chain more sustainable.\" Animesh Behera (India) Animesh Behera \"I am tackling a very global issue that we are all facing: the issue of waste. We all produce so much of it! The issue here is that we are used to using materials in a linear way.

This is taking massive proportions in my own country, but happens throughout the world \u2014 70 percent of all waste is from cities alone.

It's these fresh perspectives that most often offer a relatively straightforward response to a problem. For instance, in our current project we are trying to find a way to use byproducts from food processing, such as olive pits or the shells of sunflower seeds, and turn them into food packaging. It would be used in food delivery or takeaway food. It's a really simple concept, but nobody has ever thought about it.

{"id": null, "body": "     The cold start into spring has made people in parts of Europe wonder if the climate is really warming. Global temperatures have not been rising in recent years. Is the earth cooling instead of warming? Symbolbild - Sommerzeit Winterwetter Looking at the average temperature over five years during the last 15 years, global temperatures might appear to be flattening out. \"Over the last decade there has been very little new warming,\" says Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. The development is not unexpected, he told DW: \"We are confident that human emissions of greenhouse gases have caused a large component of the warming over the last 150 years, but at the same time we do not expect every year to be warmer than the last. There are reasons why temperatures may remain flat for a decade and continue to warm later on.\" Hawkins cites periods in the 1960s and 1970s when temperatures were actually cooling. The current flattening out of the temperature curve could be due to natural fluctuation: \"The earth's system undergoes variability on decadal time scales, which causes heat to be mixed into the deeper ocean. We think that's what's going on at the moment. Some of the heat is being mixed down into the deep ocean, where we do not observe it as well, so the surface is not heating up as much as it might have done.\" Countries like China need power for development Another possible reason Hawkins mentions is the increased burning of coal in countries like China and India. The particulates produced help reflect solar radiation back into space, and so cool the planet. He stresses it is not yet possible to say whether the current slow-down in temperature rise is being caused by natural variability or is human-induced.  Too short a time to tell  Peter Lemke is head of Climate Science at Germany's Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine studies (AWI). He warns against taking a short five-year average as an indicator of how the climate is developing: \"When it comes to climate processes, we always look at 30 year periods\", he told DW. \"And for the last 30 years there is a clear upward trend.\" Using a shorter time span means that one single year can distort the picture. If, for instance, 1998, an exceptionally hot year, is taken as the start or end of a five-year period, the trend would appear to be rising or falling, accordingly. Lemke says temperatures have indeed risen in the last 15 years - if you look at the overall development and not at shorter intervals within the time span. \"2010 was the warmest year from a global perspective,\" says Lemke. \"2005 was not far behind it. Since 1978, temperatures have not been within the normal range but considerably above it.\" \"Normal\" means an average measured over a 30-year period. Global temperatures continue to rise But certainty that global warming is happening does not mean certainty over its effect, says Lemke: \"The question is: how sensitive is our climate system to the rise in the CO2 concentration? And what will it mean in terms of precipitation, temperature rise or ice melt? That is a complicated issue.\" But this very issue is the crucial one for those who have to take decisions about preparing for and adapting to climate change. A whole range of different models estimate the likely temperature rise in the next 100 years as somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees Celsius. The next IPPC report, due to be published in 2014, is unlikely to be able to solve the problem of this wide range of estimates and methods, says Lemke. Nevertheless, he says the current slow-down of the warming rate is no reason to stop worrying about climate change. British scientist Hawkins thinks there may be a \"slight downwards nudge\" in the IPCC estimates of climate sensitivity. Nevertheless, he says, \"we are still predicting a large warming over coming decades. It may be that we have slightly more time than we did before, which is obviously a good thing, but the impacts are still projected to occur. \"  Climate warming = colder winters?  The long winter and cold spring which might give people in western Europe the impression the earth is cooling rather than warming have been caused by a stable area of high pressure over Scandinavia - a weather phenomenon rather than climate change. AWI climate chief Lemke stresses that seen from a global point of view, the winter was warmer than usual. It's a climate paradox that melting ice could mean colder winters \"The interesting thing is that some climate studies indicate that a stable area of high pressure over Scandinavia like this one could occur more often when the pack ice in the Arctic has been significantly reduced in the previous summer and autumn\", Lemke explains. This lack of ice means the ocean warms up and releases the warmth into the atmosphere in the autumn. That disturbs the usual circulation patterns, so that we get the area of high pressure, and that it is more stable than usual.\" In 2012, Arctic sea ice coverage reached a record low. The long period of cold spring weather would seem to confirm the theory expressed by Vladimir Petoukhov from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. When he published his paper in late 2010, his comment was \"hard winters do not contradict our image of global warming. On the contrary, they complete the picture. \" Climate change has come to our attention through scientific studies of rising sea levels and shrinking ice caps. Yet many still doubt it's cause. For the so-called climate sceptics, Clemens Simmer has a clear answer.

{"id": null, "body": "     Although Australia has always lived with bushfire, climate change is expected to make bushfires more frequent, severe and long. Homeowners are developing their own responses - but strong climate policy is still lacking. The bushfire season has started a month early in Australia, with record-breaking heat waves recorded across the continent in October contributing to several large fires destroying properties. More than 200 fires have already burnt across the state of Victoria, and five houses were lost. The early outbreak of bushfires could be a taste of what is to come in Australia's summer. Scientists are forecasting a long, hot, dry season, exacerbated by climate change and a \"Godzilla\" El Nino system in the Pacific. Bushfires are a part of the Australian landscape - but under climate change, scientists expect them to become much more severe. This surge in bushfires is leading to a revamp of building codes - while homeowners are developing their own responses, out of necessity. But Australia still lacks a coordinated climate policy, and climate protection advocates continue to criticize the country's lack of ambition in emissions reduction pledges.  Climate change making fire season more severe Professor Lesley Hughes from Macquarie University is a member of the Climate Council, an independent think tank. She said climate change is driving the increase in bushfire weather and longer fire seasons. \"What we're seeing, especially in southern Australia, is hotter drier summers,\" Hughes told DW. \"Bushfires tend to start in October and go through to March.\" She said October 2015 set new heat records across southern Australia, with temperatures at least 12 degrees Celsius above average for most of the region. At risk are also vast natural areas, including the plant and animal species that depend on them Hughes expects that globally, 2015 will surpass last year as the hottest ever recorded - but she says Australia is not prepared, and the number of firefighters will need to double. She added that as the fire seasons get longer in the southern and northern hemispheres, the sharing of equipment like water-bombing helicopters becomes more problematic. \"Both hemispheres need the equipment at the same time, so resources are constrained, and our emergency services are going to need more resources to deal with the increasing fire threat.\"  Lack of firefighting resources Jim Casey is the NSW secretary of the Fire Brigade Employees Union and a member of the newly formed Australian firefighters' Climate Alliance. He says climate change is making the job of firefighting more difficult - and more dangerous. \"It's a serious question about workplace safety,\" he told DW. \"The world is our workplace. It's a dangerous enough place as it is; anything that increases that risk, we take very seriously.\" Firefighters are expecting a severe fire season this summer. The Climate Council says since 2009, there has been an increase in the number of days where temperature and weather pose a \"catastrophic\" fire risk. Increased bushfires are also expensive: The Climate Council released a report last year showing that the bushfires will cost Australia more than 500 million euros by the middle of the century. Casey is urging governments to address the cause of climate change and limit greenhouse gases. \"We are going to see more incredibly destructive fires on the eastern seaboard, that's just a fact,\" Casey said. \"The question now is whether we're going to take action to address this at its root,\" he added. Bushfires are making for more dangerous firefighting work  Impact on people's lives Two years ago in October, unseasonably hot weather in the state of New South Wales during spring gave an early start to the bushfire season. Adriana Hernandez remembers it well: On October 17, 2013, she was at work 150 kilometers west of Sydney when she was told to go home early because a nearby bushfire was threatening her workplace. She rushed back to her home in the Blue Mountains suburb of Winmalee - but a fire truck was blocking access to her house. \"As I'm pulling into the main street, I just saw this massive red cloud, and saw all the cops, I didn't realize there was a fire at Winmalee,\" Hernandez recounted. \"I didn't know if I had a house. I went to sleep at my in-laws, and I shared a bed with my two year old, and I thought: If I don't have a house at least I've got this,\" she said. Her house survived, but many of her neighbors' houses didn't. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed in the fires, and two people were killed in what has been described as the worst bushfires in the state of New South Wales in 70 years. The Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria in 2009, often described as a \"firestorm,\" killed 173 people, many of whom tried to shelter in their own homes for protection. Adriana Hernandez said she's already prepared for this year's bushfire season. \"I'm ready. I've already cleaned my gutters, I've cut my trees. I have my little stash of important documents, so if anything happens, I'll just leave,\" she said. Climate change is fueling bushfires that are destroying homes  Uncertainty on impacts remain Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, along with its national science body the CSIRO, released a report earlier this year showing that as greenhouse gases continue to rise, Australia is on track for increasingly extreme weather events - leading to more intense bushfires. But Ross Bradstock, a professor and director of the Center for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires at the University of Wollongong, said the story is a bit more complicated. Some parts of the Australian continent will get more rain, he explained, while other parts may dry out. Climate change will affect vegetation growth, which can fuel bushfires, Bradstock said. \"Climate change will also affect weather conditions that cause a fire to spread, wind and heat, and ignition such as lightning,\" he continued. \"Unraveling all those effects under the influence of climate change is complex, there's still a lot of uncertainty and different things may happen in different parts,\" Bradstock concluded.  Lack of master plan These devastating fires are beginning to lead to a rewrite of building codes across Australia, especially for new homes being built in bushfire-prone areas. Alan Green, a PhD student at the Sustainable Buildings Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, said there are a number of ways to design or retrofit an existing building to make it more resilient to fire. This includes making the building \"ember-tight,\" or covering any gaps or cracks that may allow flying embers to set it on fire, and using non-combustible building and protecting windows and doors from bushfire attack. \"My research is looking at sprinkler systems to assist these methods, or in some cases to replace them,\" Green said. The fires are not only deadly, but expensive too But many of these measures are expensive - and the onus is on individuals to adapt to the changing climatic conditions and an increased bushfire risk. In the bigger picture, the Australian government is taking to the COP21 climate summit in Paris a pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Hughes from the Climate Council says this is not ambitious enough for a country that will so keenly feel the impacts of climate change. \"We have 200 billion [Australian dollars worth of] infrastructure at risk from 1-meter sea level and storm surges,\" Hughes said. \"Murray-Darling basin - where 40 percent of our food is produced - is getting drier threatening our wheat exports. The Great Barrier Reef may not survive past 2 degrees.\" \"We should be more ambitious than the rest of the world, and not less,\" she concluded. Leadership changes in two of the world's highest per-capita emitting countries have yielded potential new climate allies. Although this may come too late to affect what's on the table in Paris, it could play out beyond.

A group of scientists on Wednesday said that this\u00a0would have been \"almost impossible\" without man-made climate change.

Our dependence on air-conditioning is probably one of the most ironic climate change feedback loops we have created: As temperatures rise, we turn up our ACs, which generate more emissions, which leads to warmer temperatures, and so on. Scientists are busy figuring out how to create cool air without electricity. If they succeed, it could hopefully be a game-changer. Much has been said abut the green credentials of electric cars. But are they really squeaky clean? While they still produce lower CO2 emissions when actually on the road, they're really only as green as their power source. And the production of electric vehicles is energy intensive because of the complex batteries required to run them. From the Great Barrier Reef to retreating glaciers: In response to the effects of climate change, more and more people are opting to visit World Heritage Sites and other fragile parts of the world while they still can. Although 'last chance' tourism can help raise awareness of environmental issues, flight emissions and stress on local resources often makes the situation even worse. Even if you choose not to travel, simply staying at home doesn't mean you aren't contributing to carbon emissions. Experts have calculated that the world's digital footprint has now exceeded that of the aviation industry. The more data we send and store, the more electricity we need. And with billions of people online regularly, those emissions add up very quickly. More people than ever are switching to a plant-based diet for the sake of the environment. But not all non-animal products are eco-friendly. The soaring popularity of avocados, for example, has led farmers to cut down precious woodlands to keep up with demand, while the production of almond milk requires the diversion of huge amounts of water in drought-prone regions. We're constantly being encouraged to invest in the latest eco-friendly products. But the truth is, you'd be helping the planet far more by not buying anything in the first place. Because any new product \u2014 no matter how 'green' \u2014 still requires resources to make. Of course, some products require fewer resources than others. But ultimately, the less stuff we buy, the better. Rising need for fresh water paired with a drier climate in many parts of the world has increased the demand for desalination plants. Unfortunately, removing salt from the water creates a toxic brine by-product, which can severely damage ecosystems if not properly treated. Although technological innovations are helping make this process more environmentally friendly, it's still not without risk.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change poses a major threat to the health of the world's children and may shape the future of a whole generation if global temperatures are not kept well below 2\u00b0C, new research shows. Pediatricians in New Delhi, India, say children's lungs are no longer pink, but black.\u00a0 Our warming planet is already impacting the health of the world's children and will shape the future of an entire generation if we fail to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6\u00b0F), the 2019 Lancet Countdown Report on health and climate change shows. \"Over the past 30 years, we've seen progressive decline in the numbers of deaths for all people and indeed for children,\" Anthony Costello, co-chair of The Lancet Countdown, told DW. \"But what we're worrying about is that all of these gains could go into reverse if we don't urgently tackle the problem of climate change.\" The research \u2014 compiled by 35 global institutions, including the World Health Organisation and the World Bank \u2014clearly shows the relationship between climate change, environmental destruction and health. Rising temperatures\u00a0fuel\u00a0hunger and malnutrition, an increase in the scale and scope of\u00a0infectious disease and\u00a0a growing frequency of extreme weather events, while\u00a0 air pollution \u00a0has become as deadly to the human lung as smoking tobacco. For some children, face masks are already vital Under current emissions, children born today will live in a 4\u00b0C warmer world by the age of 71, the report says Difficult access to food A baby born today will be exposed to the impacts of climate change from the very start of its life. Rising temperatures coupled with drought and flooding devastate crops, causing global yields to decline. \u00a0This\u00a0deprives people of their livelihoods and pushes up food prices, which in turn leads to hunger and malnutrition, particularly in countries heavily reliant on agriculture, such as Burkina Faso. \"Acute malnutrition in five-year-old children\u00a0in Burkina Faso is over 10%,\" Maurice Ye, a native to the country and advisor to the National Malaria Control Program in Madagascar, told DW. \"This will increase if nothing is done to address the problem.\" In India, malnutrition is already the reason for two thirds of deaths in children under the age of five, the Lancet report states. Although malnutrition is often linked to hunger, it can also be the result of eating too much unhealthy food.\u00a0As staples such as grains and rice\u00a0face price hikes, consumers are motivated to buy cheaper, processed foods instead.\u00a0 \"That feeds into the other end of the malnutrition spectrum, which is that of overweight and obesity,\"\u00a0Poornima Prabhakaran, deputy director of the Centre for Environmental Health at the Public Health Foundation of India\u00a0and contributing author\u00a0of the report,\u00a0told DW. A deadly breeding ground Under-fives will also suffer most from the\u00a0increase in infectious diseases. Rising temperatures, warming waters, changing rainfall\u00a0patterns and high levels of\u00a0humidity facilitate the spread of bacteria leading to diarrheal diseases such as cholera, and also create ideal breeding conditions for\u00a0mosquitoes carrying malaria or dengue fever. In 2017, there were an estimated 435,000 deaths from malaria globally and every two minutes a child somewhere in the world dies from the disease, according to the World Health Organisation \u00a0(WHO). This is of particular concern for countries such as Burkina Faso, where malaria caused over 28,000\u00a0deaths in 2018 alone, the WHO estimates. But climate change will also allow these disease-carrying mosquitoes to reach new countries, such as those in southern European. Around half of the world's population is now at risk from dengue disease, the Lancet report says. If children survive malnutrition and infectious diseases, the research continues, they might not be spared devastating air pollution. This\u00a0can corrupt\u00a0their lung function, worsen asthma and increase the risk of heart attacks and stroke. Outdoor air pollution \u2014 from fine particulate matter (PM2.5) \u2014 already contributes\u00a0to 2.9 million premature deaths worldwide.\u00a0 Extreme weather events are also becoming the new normal in European countries Heat and cold hit hard The health of a child born today could equally be damaged by extreme weather events such as wildfires and heat waves. 152 out of 196 countries have experienced an increase in people exposed to wildfires since 2001, which has resulted in direct deaths and respiratory illness. Record-breaking high temperatures, in turn, are of particular concern for elderly people over 65-years-old. \"Heat health impacts include heat exhaustion, heat stroke and\u00a0aggravation of already existing morbidities from\u00a0cardiovascular illness and respiratory illness,\" Prabhakaran said. Heat can also lead to dehydratation in children and the elderly, experts say. Although the world is warming, cold also represents a risk for people with little or no access to energy. \"It kills more people than the heat overall,\" Costello said. \"But a lot of that is due to social factors.\"\u00a0 As inequalities are growing worldwide, more p eople find themselves\u00a0in situations of vulnerability, he said. An urgent coal phase-out Prabhakaran hopes health impacts will be the turning point for reluctant policy makers. \"What we need to do is bring health in the center of discourse, the health impacts of fossil fuel combustion can be a strong argument for phasing out coal,\" she said. The three experts agree that the first step to reducing the suffering of every child born today is a shift to a decarbonized world. It is technically feasible, they say, but will take tougher policies and genuine political will. Inaction is no longer an option. \"It's set to get much, much worse unless we take immediate action,\" Costello said. Investigators are still looking into what prompted the blazes in southern California that killed three people over recent days. In the north of the state, electricity to hundreds of thousands of residences and businesses was switched off this week as a precautionary measure to cut the wildfire risk raised by sparks emitted from old infrastructure. The spread of the fires was accelerated by dry conditions exacerbated by powerful Santa Ana winds carrying desert air. Many regions needed only a spark to erupt into flames. Some 100,000 people were ordered to leave their homes as the fires approached Los Angeles. This highway in Sylmar was clogged with people driving through the smoke to safety. Interstate 5, the main north-to-south corridor in the state, was shut down for much of the day on Friday. Hundreds of homes across the southern California region have been destroyed. This one in Porter Ranch was one of those to fall victim to the wildfires burning in several areas of the state. Two people were confirmed dead after the Sandalwood Fire raced through the Villa Calimesa Mobile Home Park east of Los Angeles on Thursday. Dozens of residences in the park were also destroyed, where an evacuation order remains in effect. In Los Angeles itself, a man in his 50s died of a heart attack while trying to save his home from the flames. This helicopter making a drop on the Saddleridge Fire was one of many used to combat the blazes. Fire danger remains high for much of Southern California. Warnings are in place for large areas in the counties of Ventura and Santa Barbara, which are situated northwest of Los Angeles. Many hundreds of firefighters have been battling the blazes, like these two in Porter Ranch. Fire officials say they expect even more intense and devastating fires in the state in future partly because of climate change. This year some 275 wildfires have broken out across California. The most destructive year on record was 2018, when 8,500 wildfires erupted in the state, killing around 100 people.

{"id": null, "body": "     No country has yet achieved the goals of the Paris Agreement, according to the Climate Change Performance Index from NGOs Germanwatch and the NewClimate Institute. In a repeat of 2019, the three top spots on this year's Climate Change Performance Index have been left conspicuously empty. Quite simply, according to the more than 100 experts who assessed the 58 countries \u2014 and the EU \u2014 responsible for 90% of global CO2 emissions , because their climate protection efforts are lacking.\u00a0 The nations on the list are scored on the basis of energy consumption per person, as well as their strategies used to reduce it, the percentage of renewables in the energy mix, the pace of clean expansion, and what policymakers are doing to implement the climate change agreement at home and internationally . \"There is gradual progress in almost every area. But this is far too slow and does not correspond to the urgency that is necessary to protect our planet,\" said Professor Niklas H\u00f6hne of the Cologne-based NewClimate Institute, which analyzes the climate protection activities of countries around the world. \"One thing that stands out is that the EU has improved significantly,\u201d he said. \"The EU is trying to move forward on policies with long-term goals, and the new short-term goal is to try to bring other countries along for the ride.\" Thanks to a much higher scoring climate policy, the EU has advanced six places to 16, and has received the overall rating \"good.\" This puts the EU well ahead of two other major emitters, the United States and China. Just like last year, the US occupied the last place (61) with China in 33rd place in the middle of the playing field. The oil-dependent nations of Saudi Arabia (60) and Iran (59) were also at the bottom of the index. According to the index, Sweden is the international role model for the fourth year in a row. While the Nordic nation did not do well enough to occupy one of the top three slots, and still has some way to go to achieving the Paris climate goals, it has set high standards in CO2 emissions, renewable energy and climate policy. Not only was Sweden's last coal-fired power station shut down this year, but the country has set a good example to the world with a high CO2 tax of roughly \u20ac115 ($139) per ton, providing incentives to develop alternatives to coal, oil and gas. Only the very high per capita energy consumption prevented an even better ranking. Sweden is followed by the UK, Denmark, Morocco, Norway, Chile and India \u2014 in that order \u2014 all with the rating \"high.\" Finland, Malta, Latvia, Switzerland, Lithuania and Portugal\u00a0also got the same ranking. Until 2009, Germany was a role model in climate protection, even taking the top spot in 2008. But in the years that followed, its performance has largely been on a downward trajectory. The only exceptions were 2012 and 2013, when the expansion of renewable energies boomed in Germany following the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. By 2018, Germany had slipped to 27th place out of 61. In this latest list, however, it has climbed back up to the 19th spot. According to the authors of the index, Germany is flailing on the expansion of renewables, is making slow progress on CO2 reduction in the\u00a0 transport sector, and needs to reduce its per capital energy consumption and CO2 emissions . \"The \u2018medium' rating could be improved with more ambitious expansion targets for renewable energy and significant corrections in the transport and building sectors, as well as in the coal phase-out,\" says Jan Burck, lead author of the report from the environmental and development NGO Germanwatch. Also around the middle of the list are Croatia (18), Ukraine (20), Egypt (22), France (23), Indonesia (24) and Brazil (25). \"The problem with Brazil is the increase in deforestation,\" climate researcher H\u00f6hne says. \"And the Amazon is not only relevant for greenhouse gas emissions, but also for the entire global climate.\" If too much deforestation takes place in the Amazon rainforest , there could be a tipping point because the climate is changing throughout the region \u2014 with far-reaching consequences for the supply of drinking water and the global climate. \"The rainforest would then no longer be a rainforest, and drought and fires would occur,\" H\u00f6hne continues. \"That would be catastrophic. That is why this is not just important for Brazil but for the whole world. And there is a very, very negative trend.\" In recent months, China and a number of other countries have declared their intention to reduce their high CO2 emissions to zero \u2014 most by 2050, China by 2060. US president-elect Joe Biden wants to make the US climate-neutral by 2050 and the power supply climate-neutral by 2035. The climate index experts see these announcements as a very important signal that the urgency of the issue has been noted and that countries really do want to do more for the climate. \"The sheer volume of countries that have understood the importance of becoming climate-neutral, means it is no longer possible to ignore it,\" H\u00f6hne said. \"The argument that 'there is no point doing something because others are not' no longer applies.\" H\u00f6hne sees \"gentle progress\" and says the\u00a0 coronavirus crisis offers the opportunity to make an about-turn. What is important now is how the billions set aside for aid to recover from the pandemic will be spent and whether the money is invested in building a carbon-neutral economy. \"There is a lot of room for maneuver in the right direction, but also in the wrong direction,\" says H\u00f6hne. \"If things go wrong, it will be very difficult to save the climate. I am convinced of that \u2014 simply because we are not going to spend money like that again for the next 10 years.\" This article was translated from German Even the world's largest CO2 emitters are suffering the effects of climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     As the planet heats up, homes are becoming uninhabitable and people are on the move. The countries most responsible for climate change are fortifying their borders to keep them out. Climate change is reshaping our world. Coastlines are creeping inland, deserts are growing, ranges of plant and animal species are shifting . And people are on the move too. Estimates for how many people will relocate because of climate change vary between 25 million to 1 billion by mid century, according to the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM). The UN warns that by 2045, 135 million people may be displaced by desertification alone. Read more: \u00a0 'Over 10 million people still need assistance in the Lake Chad region' Last year, the IMO suggested that governments respond with policies such as \"ensuring migration pathways via free movement protocols\" and \"expediting or waiving visas.\" But in his book 'Storming the Wall: Climate Change, Migration, and Homeland Security,' Todd Miller argues that some countries are instead putting up barricades to keep them out. \"You see this emphasis on border enforcement, on creating these hardened lines of division,\" Miller told DW, \"and so often, they are going up against countries that have a lot of issues to do with ecological events and climate change.\" Caravans flee Central America's Dry Corridor Donald Trump may profess not to believe in climate change, but it could be a factor driving support for his signature border wall. Miller argues that a zone of drought known as the \"Dry Corridor,\" where crops are failing and livestock is perishing, has exacerbated tensions on the US-Mexican border. A farmer in Honduras shows the effects of drought on his maize crop. Drought in Central America has put pressure on communities already blighted by poverty and crime \"One of the things about the Dry Corridor is that 15 years ago that term didn't even exist,\" Miller says. \"So this is kind of a new term \u2014 you can almost say it's a manifestation of the changing climate.\" Last year, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras reported combined losses of 281,000 hectares (694,000 acres) of staple crops due to drought. It was in these three countries that migrant caravans formed and headed north, making for striking media reports and fueling US anxieties over immigration. Read more: \u00a0 Caravan migrants at US-Mexico border begin hunger strike Europe militarizes it borders In Europe, fears over migration exploded in 2015 and 2016, when an estimated million people arrived, mainly from Africa and the Middle East. One European Union response was to turn its border agency, Frontex, into a full European Border and Coast Guard, giving it control over its own budget, which was raised to \u20ac238 million ($268 million) \u2014 nearly 38 times what it was a decade earlier \u2014\u00a0 as well as the authority to compel member states to secure their borders. Read more:\u00a0 Follow the money: What are the EU's migration policy priorities? \"Especially since 2015 \u2014 the start of the so-called refugee crisis \u2014 it's really been a militarization of European borders and beyond,\" Mark Akkerman of Dutch organization Stop Wapenhandel, who has authored a series of reports on how military and security companies have profited from the crisis, told DW. Miller says the militarization of borders is a global trend: When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, there were just 15 border walls across the globe. Today there are 77. Meteorological margins push against political borders Some people are driven to leave their homes directly because of drought or flood. But the role of climate change in migration is often far more complex. In January, the UN Security Council held a debate framing global warming as a \"threat multiplier.\" Crop failures, natural disasters and depleted resources \u2014 be they fertile soils or water \u2014 can tip delicate economic and political balances into crisis, fueling poverty and conflict. In their book 'Conflict Shoreline,' Eyal Weizman and Fazal Sheikh of interdisciplinary research group Forensic Architecture , examine the world's longest aridity line \u2014 where the minimum amount of rain falls to support cereal crops without artificial irrigation. Livelihoods in these conditions are highly sensitive to changes in climate. The line runs through sites of recent conflict including southern Gaza, Helmand, and Daraa, where the Syrian uprising first broke out in 2011 following unprecedented drought. The team also plotted Western drone strikes onto meteorological maps and found that \"many of these attacks \u2014 from South Waziristan through northern Yemen, Somalia, Mali, Iraq, Gaza, and Libya \u2014 were directly on or close to\" the aridity line. Read more:\u00a0 'Climate change contributed to war in Syria' \u00a0 Researchers at Columbia University, meanwhile, have shown that between 2000 and 2014, temperatures deviating from the norm in countries migrants come from correlated with increased asylum applications in Europe. Climate change, migration and terror The EU did not make Frontex what it is today as a direct response to climate change. But Akkerman says it's hard to imagine decisions over European border policy are completely unaffected by the knowledge that immigration is likely to increase \u2014 due to a variety of factors. \"Climate change is one of those factors,\" he says. \"I think the EU definitely does take that into account even if they don't say it out loud at the moment.\" In the US though, the link between global warming and border security has been explicit. In 2010, Washington officially listed climate change as a threat to national security. That, Miller explains, required the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 which deals with border and immigration enforcement \u2014 to formulate a response. \"You see this top-level consciousness of what climate change could bring,\" Miller says. \"And things like the droughts in Central America are mentioned in those papers.\" The result was \"the US government saying, we have to build up our borders due to mass migration.\" Trump's wall is only the latest and most audacious idea in a series of moves that have made it increasingly difficult for migrants enter the US from the south in recent years In Europe, too, Akkerman points to politicians increasingly framing climate change and migration, which often gets linked to terrorism, as a security threats rather than humanitarian crises. \"And if you frame something as a security threat, step two is looking for military means to combat that,\" he says. Read more: \u00a0 Climate change a threat to world order, Munich Security Conference hears Dying on Europe's doorstep Since 2014, the EU has replaced Mediterranean search-and-rescue missions with operations whose primary focus is security and border enforcement.\u00a0 Across Europe, politicians \u2014 from Italian nationalists to the Conservative British government that cancelled its funding for search-and-rescue in 2013 \u2014 and Frontex itself, have argued that rescues\u00a0act as a \"pull factor\" encouraging migrants to make the journey. But experts say there is no evidence for this. Moreover, tightening borders just forces people to take riskier journeys. \"This trend is continuing, things are becoming more and more dangerous because more and more routes are closed,\" says Ramona Lenz, a cultural anthropologist with aid organization Medico International. \u00a0\u00a0 According to\u00a0 the Heinrich Boll Foundation , the death rate among those trying to cross the Mediterranean has increased nine times since 2015. Spanish group Proactiva Open Arms comes to the aid of migrants in the Med. Some NGO workers filling in the gap after EU search-and-rescue operations were cut have faced criminal charges of people smuggling In 2016,\u00a0 The Intercept published Frontex documents showing that coast guards had\u00a0shot at migrant boats. \"There is much more violence towards refugees and migrants and it is much more accepted,\" Lenz says. Nationalism in a globalized world In the wake of the 2015-2016 migrant influx, far-right politics has entered the mainstream around Europe. But Lenz says solutions demand the very opposite of nationalism: inclusive thinking that understands the interconnected flows of resources, waste, emissions, money and people across the globe. \"If we go on like this, migration will increase, more people will have to leave their homes and look for other places to stay,\" she says. \"We know that and we don't want to be confronted with this complexity \u2014 the complexity of a globalized world \u2014 so we look for simple solutions. But they won't work out for long.\" Ultimately, the climatic changes that are making parts of the world unlivable are another example of people in poorer parts of the world paying the price of Western lifestyles. \"If we really want to change something we have to start in industrialized countries,\" Lenz says, \"with how we consume, how we buy things, how we live \u2014 we would have to change very basic things that concern our own lives.\" Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, addressing the drought in the state of New South Wales, which produces one-quarter of the country's agricultural output, said, \"Now we are the land of drought.\" Australia recently passed legislation to provide hundreds of millions of dollars worth of relief aid to farmers, including funds for mental health support. Ethiopia has been suffering from ongoing drought conditions since 2015, causing massive food shortages. The Ethiopian government said that some 8.5 million citizens required emergency food assistance in 2017 and that nearly 400,000 infants suffered acute malnutrition. Furthermore, the drought threatens to end traditional nomadic herding in the region. Conservation and late-season rains saved South Africa's Cape Town from an apocalyptic Day Zero scenario, in which water would have to be turned off and emergency rations issued, The drought, which was one of the worst in decades, emptied water reservoirs and caused some experts to suggest hauling icebergs from Antarctica avert a crisis. Europe's sweltering heat has been compounded by a lack of rain. Not only have citizens been suffering the health consequences, which affect health care systems and labor productivity, crops have also been hit hard. Farmers across the continent fear bankruptcy due to poor crops and the EU Joint Research Center predicts \"an increase in drought frequency and intensity in the future.\" Greece has been facing the dual problem of flash flooding in some regions and drought in others. Crete's farmers said they could lose up to 40 percent of their crop this year due to an extremely dry winter. Though they are watering, they say it is not enough to nourish their crops. Water levels are so low that previously submerged villages have begun to reappear in reservoirs across the country. Sweden, which has not seen rain for over three months, is experiencing its worst drought since 1944. The situation threatens to cause severe crop losses costing farmers hundreds of thousands of euros. Sweden has been the site of massive forest fires and has even seen temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Arctic Circle. The United Kingdom fears serious threats to its food supply chain due to the effects of this summer's drought. The country's National Farmers Union said the country is experiencing \"tinderbox conditions.\" This adds to problems brought on by the prospect of needed self-reliance in the event of a no-deal Brexit. India has been plagued by water shortages due to rising population and mismanagement but also aggravated by drought, causing many areas of the country to run out of water. Bangalore was recently added to the list of global cities most likely to run out of drinking water. Other cities on the list include Cape Town, South Africa; Jakarta, Indonesia and Sao Paolo, Brazil. The US government said 29 percent of the country is currently experiencing drought, with conditions affecting some 75 million people. Although wildfires in California have captured the world's attention, farming states, like Kansas, have once again been suffering. Kansas was one of the states crippled by the famous 1930s Dust Bowl.

{"id": null, "body": "     A new study by WWF predicts drastic consequences for animal species around the world if temperatures keep rising \u2014 even if pledged limits to global warming are met. Global warming will\u00a0threaten up to 50 percent of the world's animal species, according to a study \u00a0recently published by the World Wide Fund for Nature\u00a0(WWF). Working with the University of East Anglia and the James Cook University, the nongovernmental organization examined\u00a035 so-called priority places\u00a0around the world, which are home to some of the planet's\u00a0most exceptional ecosystems and habitats. These include\u00a0biodiversity hot spots\u00a0such as the Amazon basin \u00a0and Madagascar . If temperatures continue to rise\u00a0in these regions as predicted, local\u00a0wildlife will be severely threatened, the study concluded. Almost 50 percent of animal\u00a0species are at risk of extinction in those places by 2080 if global temperatures increase\u00a0by 4.5 degrees Celsius (8.1 degrees Fahrenheit). Even reaching the goal of keeping global temperatures under a\u00a02-degree\u00a0Celsius rise over pre-industrial levels\u00a0 as determined by the Paris Agreement \u00a0will still have harm wildlife: almost 25 percent of species in priority places are still at risk under such a scenario, according to the study.\u00a0 WWF has identified 35 so-called Priority Places around the world which are considered hot-spots for biodiversity No escape Around\u00a0the world, animals such as the African elephant or the giant\u00a0panda could vanish from their natural habitats. But\u00a0plants, amphibians and reptiles face an even greater struggle for survival, as they have a harder time\u00a0escaping the effects of climate change. \"Species reorganize with the climate,\" WWF spokesman\u00a0Jeff Price told DW,\u00a0\"but they do that at different rates. Birds, for example, deal with\u00a0the effects of\u00a0climate change reasonably well.\"\u00a0 The study makes a distinction\u00a0between species who have the capacity for biological dispersal \u2014 that is, the ability to migrate from one site to another \u2014 and those that cannot. If global temperatures\u00a0increase by 4.5 degree Celsius, 13 percent of migratory birds are at risk of local extinction, compared to\u00a074 percent of amphibians , which are unable to move as far. However, even those species that are able to move between different sites might\u00a0 face hindrances . \"That's why it's best to try and\u00a0keep things intact as they currently are,\"\u00a0says Price. Gerhard Haszprunar, director of the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich, thinks\u00a0the study's findings are\u00a0plausible. But he points out that even more species would be considered at risk if ocean habitats were also\u00a0taken into account. The rate of species extinction is already\u00a0alarmingly high, Haszprunar confirmed to DW. He sees this as not just\u00a0a direct result of climate change, but also linked to deforestation and intenstive agriculture. Let's start with the good news. According to the latest Red List update, the number of mountain gorillas has significantly increased. The IUCN has said the number of animals has risen from about 680 a decade ago to more than 1,000 now. Intensive conservation action such as removal of snares has contributed to the rebound of the mountain gorilla, which inhabits the Congo region's jungles. Fin whales are now considered vulnerable rather than the more worrisome label of endangered. Their number has roughly doubled since the 1970s, to around 100,000 individuals, according to the IUCN. The situation of gray whales has also been upgraded \u2014 from critically endangered to endangered. Bans on commercial whaling have made a real impact on conservation. Yet the IUCN also issued warnings about the consequences of overfishing. For example, 13 percent of grouper species worldwide and 9 percent of the approximately 450 fish species in Lake Malawi in eastern Africa are threatened with extinction. \"Depleting fish stocks are a serious concern for food security, particularly for coastal communities in developing countries,\" the IUCN said. In a previous Red List update, the Mauritian flying fox \u2014 an important pollinator \u2014 moved from vulnerable to endangered. The bat population fell by a whopping 50 percent from 2015 to 2016 due largely to government-implemented culling sparked by alleged damage to fruit crops. The megabat species also faces threats from deforestation, illegal hunting and an increase in cyclone activity. Invasive species are threatening a number of unique Australian reptiles. This grassland earless dragon has shifted from vulnerable to endangered. It often falls prey to feral cats, as well as changes to the intensity and frequency of bushfires. Like most native Australian wildlife, the reptile is adapted to environmental conditions that existed before European settlement. Taking its name from \"The Lord of the Rings\" character Smeagol \u2014 aka Gollum \u2014 the precious stream toad is also on the list of species threatened with extinction. It is listed as vulnerable, largely as a result of expanding tourist resorts and complexes in its Genting Highlands habitat in Malaysia. The population of keas, New Zealand's Bird of the Year 2017, is declining rapidly, mostly due to tourists who keep feeding the curious parrots junk food. As a result, the birds get used to trying novel food and end up eating poison bait meant to control pests such as rats, stoats, or possums, which destroy up to 60 percent of the birds' nests each year. You can see the connection, can't you? Black-legged kittiwakes rely on certain key prey, like sand eels. But a lack of eels to eat means breeding colonies in the North Atlantic and Pacific are struggling to feed their chicks. Globally, the species is thought to have declined by around 40 percent since the 1970s. The main cause is overfishing and alterations in the ocean due to climate change. The snowy owl is vulnerable, with recent population estimates much lower than previously thought. Climate change has hit the iconic Arctic bird hard, as it has increased snowmelt and reduced the availability of rodent prey. A quarter of bird species reassessed in the Red List, including the snowy owl, have become more endangered. Five species of African antelopes \u2014 of which four were previously assessed as least concern \u2014 have been declining drastically as a result of poaching, habitat degradation and competition with domestic livestock. One of these is the gray rhebok, for which the Reebok sports brand is named. The world's largest antelope, the giant eland \u2014 previously assessed as least concern \u2014 is also vulnerable. Its estimated global population is between 12,000 and 14,000 at most, with fewer than 10,000 mature animals. This species is declining due to poaching for bushmeat, human encroachment into protected areas and expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing.

As extreme heat becomes more frequent around the world, how can affected areas adapt to remain livable? Workers use their helmets to pour water to cool themselves off near a construction site on a hot summer day on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India The effects of India's heat wave, one of dozens just this year , are all-encompassing. Temperatures topping 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) across the country have put millions at risk for heat-related illnesses, decimated wheat crops, intensified a power crisis and interrupted schooling.\u00a0 India is not alone. Neighboring Pakistan is also battling scorching temperatures before summer has even begun. And earlier this year, central South America was the hottest place on the planet before Western Australia claimed the title.\u00a0 As the climate crisis exacerbates heat waves around the world and temperatures increasingly soar unseasonably early, countries are faced with the question of how to remain livable.\u00a0 Ramping up electricity bills with air conditioning, cooling down with fans, working indoors \u2014 these options are only available to a privileged few.\u00a0 \"The story of climate change is one of high inequality and we're seeing that playing out already in the poorest and hottest regions of the world,\"\u00a0said Tamma Carleton, assistant professor of economics at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. Carleton co-authored a 2022 study that distilled a city's ability to minimize deaths during extreme temperatures to two main factors:\u00a0affluence and the number of hot days it experiences.\u00a0 Money decides which\u00a0technologies a city can afford to shield its most vulnerable. And when these adaptation costs aren't covered by the state, the burden falls on individuals to finance their own protection, says Carleton. A situation that leaves the poorest high and dry. But even wealthy cities can suffer if they are caught off guard without an action plan. That happened in the Pacific Northwest of the US, a wealthy region known for its temperate climate, where more than 100 people were killed in last year's heat wave .\u00a0 \u00a0\"We tend to see in our projections of climate change into the future that poorer places are going to be facing a really large increase in death risk and wealthier places are going to see an increase in adaptation costs,\"\u00a0said Carleton.\u00a0 Outdoor workers are especially vulnerable to heat waves Just how high this death risk is in developing countries became clear when Ahmedabad, a city in western India's Gujarat state, lost more than 1,344 people as thermometers hit 47\u00b0C (116\u00b0F) in 2010.\u00a0 The toll spurred the city into action. In 2013, it rolled out a plan that has prevented about 1,100 heat induced deaths each year since, according to a study .\u00a0 The first heat action plan in South Asia, it includes an early warning system, community outreach to vulnerable populations and education for health staff about possible signs of heat exposure. It also organizes cooling centers in buildings such as temples and malls as well as reduced or staggered working times for outdoor laborers, among other things.\u00a0 As India's temperatures consistently surpass the baseline in spring and summer months, the Ahmedabad heat plan has since served as a template for similar models in 23 of the country's 28 states.\u00a0 But as high temperatures persist, these models undergo regular updates, according to Polash Mukherjee, Lead for Air Pollution and Climate Resilience at the Natural Resources Defense Council's India program. The non-profit helped develop Ahmedabad's heat action plan. \u00a0\"The focus has shifted significantly in the last couple of years from merely protecting human health and mortality against extreme heat to more proactive measures,\"\u00a0said Mukherjee. \"These include changing building by-laws so that new constructions are better insulated, and the cool roofs program.\" A low-cost solution to reduce indoor temperatures, the cool roofs program primarily targets badly insulated houses in slums where informal workers and other vulnerable groups reside. When a roof is coated with materials like lime-based whitewash or white tarp, it becomes more reflective and absorbs less heat. \u00a0Ideas like these are budding around the world. The Japanese capital Tokyo has introduced cool pavements, which work with thermal-barrier coating, for example. Medellin in Colombia has planted \"green corridors,\"\u00a0vegetated passages that offer more shade in public spaces, while the city of Toronto, Canada, offers grants for people to install green or cool roofs. Some cities have introduced heat officers, whose task it is to coordinate the response to rising temperatures.\u00a0 Eugenia Kargbo became Africa's first heat officer when she took the post in Freetown, Sierra Leone. A goal of hers is to provide reflective market shade covers that protect women selling produce outdoors. To make the capital more livable, she has also introduced a tree planting program, in which planters can collect micro-payments on an app.\u00a0 \u00a0\"This is the future I envision for my children and all the children in Freetown: A safe environment not limited by the risk of extreme heat,\"\u00a0she told DW's EcoAfrica.\u00a0 Even as some regions find ways to alleviate some of the effects of scorching heat waves, many scientists emphasize that governments shouldn't forget the root cause of the rising temperatures: the climate crisis. Aditi Mukherji, who co-authored the water chapter in the\u00a0 IPCC's assessment on \"Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability,\"\u00a0says the onus to come up with solutions shouldn't be on the most affected, who historically have emitted the least amount of CO2. \"I feel that when it comes to these kinds of heat extremes, the only solution is that the high emitting countries stop emissions immediately and stop burning fossil fuels,\"\u00a0she said.

In this photo, people are seen struggling to fill water from a municipal tanker in the city of Kolkata. India's summer season typically starts in April and continues until early July, regularly claiming scores of lives due to heatstroke and gastrointestinal infections.

The earth is heating up faster than many realize The threats posed by climate change are worse than those imagined by most governments, warned Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the scientist who heads the Potsdam Institute for Research on Global Warming Effects and acts as an adviser to German Chancellor Angela Merkel on climate-change issues. Schellnhuber warns that previous predictions about climate change and its catastrophic effects were too cautious and optimistic. \"In nearly all areas, the developments are occurring more quickly than it has been assumed up until now,\" Schellnhuber told the Saarbruecker Zeitung newspaper in an interview published Monday, Dec. 29. \"We are on our way to a destabilization of the world climate that has advanced much further than most people or their governments realize.\" Melting ice, rising water levels Ice in Greenland is melting fast The Arctic sea ice is melting more quickly than expected. There are also signs that the entire climate pattern at the North Poll has been disrupted to the extent of causing irreversible change. For the Arctic, the global warming which has already occurred of 0.8 degrees Celsius has already stepped over the line, Schellnhuber said. If Greenland's ice cap ice melts completely, water levels will rise by seven meters (23 feet). \"The current coastline will no longer exist, and that includes in Germany,\" he said. All countries need to sign on Will Europe's shift towards renewable energy be fast enough? In order to stop global warming, global CO2 emissions would need to be halved by 2050. For industrial countries, that would mean a decrease of 80 to 90 percent. By 2020, this process has to be well underway. \"When only one side fails to act, industrial countries or developing countries, than a disastrous climate change will be inevitable,\" he said.

{"id": null, "body": "     A group of families have filed a lawsuit against the European Union for failing to protect citizens against the impacts of climate change. It's the first climate lawsuit at EU level. A total of ten families from five EU countries, Kenya and Fiji, as well as a Swedish youth organization, are taking the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to court. They say the EU is violating their fundamental rights of life, health, livelihood and property by failing to\u00a0combat global warming. The People's Climate Case , as the lawsuit has been dubbed, was filed with the European General Court on May 24. It argues that the EU's 2030 climate target of reducing\u00a0domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent\u00a0compared to 1990 levels, is inadequate. Instead, they are demanding\u00a0a reduction of at least 50 to 60 percent by 2030. The plaintiffs argue that three EU emission regulation legal acts,\u00a0issued as part of the 2030 climate target,\u00a0still allow for high levels of greenhouse gases to be emitted. They are asking the EU to raise the target in defense of the fundamental rights of citizens \u2014\u00a0not just of those living in Europe, but also\u00a0beyond its borders, who suffer from climate change as a result of EU emissions.\u00a0 The plaintiff families are suffering from climate change, for instance by losing their plantation to the wildfires in Portugal Unprecedented case \"This court case is incredibly important and unique because it's addressing the European Union as a whole and not individual states,\"\u00a0Stefan K\u00fcper, press spokesperson for the NGO Germanwatch, which is supporting the People's Climate Case, told DW. \"This is vital, because it's the EU that's responsible for setting minimum thresholds for the climate policy of EU member states, not the member states themselves. They can be more ambitious than the set guidelines if they want, but they have to stick to the minimum threshold.\" The EU is responsible for 10 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, which makes it the third largest emitter after China and the United States. \"What also makes this court case so unique is that it's about fundamental rights. It's asking the EU to take its own values seriously and base its policies on the values the EU stands for,\"\u00a0K\u00fcper said. One of the goals of the lawsuit is for the EU court to rule that climate change is a human rights issue and that the EU is responsible for protecting the rights of\u00a0current citizens as well as future generations. Witness reports The plaintiff families are already feeling the impacts of climate change. They include families from the south of France and Portugal\u00a0struggling with heat waves and droughts, as well as forest fires, which threaten\u00a0their health and livelihood. A French\u00a0family, for instance, lost 44 percent of their harvest over six years. One of the Portuguese plaintiff families lost a tree plantation to\u00a0forest fires in 2017. A Portuguese beekeeping\u00a0family say\u00a0their livelihood is at stake because bees cannot adapt to climate variations fast enough and produce less honey. A family from the Italian Alps\u00a0working in tourism are\u00a0worried about the lack of snow and ice\u00a0they have experienced in recent years.\u00a0 And the Swedish Saami youth group fear\u00a0losing reindeer\u00a0because summers are getting hotter. \"If we lose the reindeer, the Saami culture will be lost,\"\u00a022-year-old Sanna Vaanar, the group's chair, told Climate Action Network Europe, the umbrella organization of the lawsuit. \"Many of the Saami youth want to stay with their families and be reindeer herders, but they cannot see a future. This is mostly due to the threat of climate change. This must be urgently addressed for the safety of our generation and the next generations,\"\u00a0she said.\u00a0 A German family from the East Frisian island of Langeoog say\u00a0their home is threatened by\u00a0rising sea levels and storm tides. \"The climate lawsuit is not only about us and our family, but about the future of all of us,\"\u00a0Maike Recktenwald, the mother of the family, told Germanwatch. \"What's happening on our island in the north of Germany is a global problem. We are just experiencing climate change more because we live in nature.\" Scientists are helping the plaintiffs by providing scientific evidence on the effects of greenhouse gas emissions Support from NGOs The families are represented by environmental lawyer Roda Verheyen, law professor Gerd Winter and London-based lawyer Hugo Leith.\u00a0 They are being supported by several environmental NGOs, including\u00a0Climate Action Network Europe (CAN-E), Europe's largest NGO coalition working on climate and energy issues, German NGO Protect the Planet, which is financing the lawsuit, and Germanwatch, which is working to raise awareness of the case. Scientists from\u00a0think tank Climate Analytics are providing\u00a0scientific evidence\u00a0for\u00a0the legal case\u00a0and are indicating what could be done to\u00a0reduce emissions far beyond the EU's current\u00a0climate target.\u00a0 \"The climate case has an appendix of more than 6,000 pages which scientifically prove that these families are already feeling the negative impact of climate change today and have their fundamental rights violated,\"\u00a0K\u00fcper from Germanwatch said. Climate lawsuits on the rise The families bringing the People's Climate Case aren't the only citizens suing governments to take action against\u00a0global warming. More and more citizens across the world see legal action as a path for climate action. In fact, more than 1,000 climate lawsuits are currently active around the world. In the US alone,\u00a0 more than 800 climate court cases \u00a0are ongoing.\u00a0 Climate court cases can\u00a0drag on for a long time,\u00a0and often fail. Environmental groups suing\u00a0the Norwegian state for opening up an area in the Norwegian Arctic to oil and gas drilling lost their case when\u00a0the court ruled for the government earlier this year. But there have been some success stories, too. In 2015, 900 Dutch citizens, represented by the Urgenda Foundation, took their government to court to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0It was the first time a group of citizens sued their own government over climate change action \u2014\u00a0and they won. The lawsuit resulted in a Dutch court ordering\u00a0the government to cut greenhouse gas emissions nationwide by at least 25 percent by the year of 2020 (compared to 1990 levels), forcing it to take further measures against climate change. The landmark ruling is the only case in the world thus far to define a government's obligation to control climate change. The Dutch landmark case laid the foundations for similar lawsuits around the world, for instance by a group of American youths, who are currently suing the US government for failing to curb climate change. In a suit similar to the People's Climate Case, 21 American plaintiffs aged\u00a0between 10 and 21\u00a0who have been personally impacted by climate change are currently suing the US government.\u00a0Some live on farms affected by drought, others have lost their homes due to floods, or face health issues as a result of forest fires. The teenagers accuse the federal government of\u00a0violating the younger generations'\u00a0constitutional rights to life and liberty by failing to take action against global warming. They argue that the government is failing\u00a0to protect essential public trust resources like air and water, which\u00a0are vital to survival. The goal of court cases like this is not necessarily just to win, but also to raise\u00a0awareness of\u00a0the negative impacts of climate change. \"Even if the plaintiffs of the People's Climate Case don't win, just handing in the case was already a step in the right direction,\u201d K\u00fcper said, \"because it draws attention to the issue and shows other people suffering from the negative impacts of climate change that they are not alone and that there are people out there fighting for positive change.\" Unprecedented heat waves swept across the globe in 2017, leading to droughts, wildfires and even deaths. Australia started the year with temperatures near 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), the \"Lucifer\" heat wave brought the mercury above 40 degrees Celsius throughout Southern Europe in July and August and scorching heat hit India's most vulnerable people. Get ready for next summer... Earlier this year, scientists realized that coral bleaching in Australia's Great Barrier Reef was worse than first thought. In some parts of the UNESCO World Heritage site, up to 70 percent of the coral has already been killed. By 2050, scientists have warned 90 percent of the reef could disappear. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are the main culprits. Armed conflicts are pushing millions of people to leave their homes or live in terribly precarious situations \u2014 and climate change is making it worse. A lack of natural resources increases the risk of conflict and makes life even harder for refugees. South Sudanese families, for instance, are escaping to neighboring countries like Uganda and Kenya \u2014 countries already suffering from drought. From New Zealand to Spain, from California to even Greenland: the world has seen a nonstop year of wildfires. Global warming has been blamed for the increased fire risk, and in some countries that risk has turned into reality. Wildfires engulfed large areas of Europe's Iberian Peninsula, causing death and destruction, while firefighters in California have had no rest for more than six months. Hurricanes Maria and Irma, which hit the Caribbean region in August and September, were two of the year's most damaging weather events. The list of deadly storms also included Ophelia in Ireland, Harvey and Nate in Central America and the US, and Xavier and Sebastian in Germany. Warming of the ocean surface has led to more evaporation, and that water may help fuel thunderstorms and hurricanes. In July, one of the largest icebergs ever recorded separated from the Larsen C ice shelf \u2014 one of Antarctica's biggest \u2014 reducing its area by more than 12 percent. While calving icebergs in the Antarctic are part of a natural cycle, scientists have linked the retreat of several Antarctic ice shelves to global warming and are closely monitoring potential long-term effects. Deteriorating air quality causes thousands of deaths around the world every year. India's capital, New Delhi, is one of the world's most polluted cities. In November, large parts of northern India and Pakistan were engulfed by a blanket of thick smog carrying harmful particulate matter. Schools were forced to close, and hospitals were full of people with respiratory problems. The high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere represent a major threat for our oceans, already in danger due to plastic pollution, overfishing and warming waters. Ocean acidification could make these waters \u2014 covering more than two-thirds of our planet's surface \u2014 a hostile environment for sea creatures. And without marine animals, entire ocean ecosystems are at risk. Superstorms often trigger flash floods and mudslides. In late December, more than 230 people were killed when a storm hit the Philippines' second-largest island of Mindanao, a tragedy exacerbated by years of deforestation. In 2017, severe floods also hit countries such as Vietnam, Peru and Sierra Leone. European countries, including Greece and Germany, also felt the damaging effects of heavy rain.

The project involves partners from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. \"The findings of the PROMESS1 project place European research on a par with the world leaders in marine geosciences, the US and Japan,\" said European Research Commissioner Philippe Busquin. \"This research helps us to understand the Earth's situation and envisage scenarios to be taken into account by policy-makers.\" Complementing ice core data Between June 24 and July 22, the team of European scientists were on a drilling expedition in the Mediterranean, which took them from Brindisi, Italy, to Barcelona, Spain, collecting long sediment cores of up to 300 meters. The data collected from the cores will be compared with data provided from ice core drilling projects. A climate researcher extracts a frozen ice core Last month, the European Commission presented the latest results of its ice core project in Antarctica (EPICA). Scientists there brought to the surface a 740,000-year-old ice core -- the oldest ever analyzed. The results will feed into computer models used to predict future climate changes. EU climate change researchers have found that over the last 740,000 years, the Earth experienced eight ice ages, and eight warmer periods. In the last 400,000 years, the warm periods have had a temperature similar to that of today. However, carbon dioxide levels, which are known to contribute to global warming, are the highest they've been in the last 440,000 years. German Environment Minister Trittin, who has clashed with industry and unions in the past, argues in an interview with DW-TV that eco- friendly policies don't necessarily run contrary to business interests. (May 30, 2004)\n\u00a0 Germany's economics and environment ministers have acheived a breakthrough in deadlocked talks over emissions trading and agreed on the limits Germany should impose on industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

{"id": null, "body": "     The German government is proposing a climate protection package that will cost billions of euros. The country is wealthy, but there are already concerns over how to fund the measures. German officials have acknowledged that the government will not meet its emissions goals for 2020. To avoid repeating this failure in 2030, the government will unveil a new climate protection package on Friday. Leaders of the ruling coalition held 18 hours of talks overnight, with news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporting that a breakthrough had been achieved. Among other things, the package that has been agreed upon contains a mechanism for monitoring progress on reaching emissions goals, AFP said, citing coalition sources. Chancellor Angela Merkel, of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), and Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz, of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), appear united when they say change has to happen \u2014 and it has to be big. In the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, Merkel made her position clear. \"Doing nothing is not an option,\" she said. Though there are financial costs to climate protection measures , Merkel said, the price of inaction is far higher. Read more : Europe's climate woes \u2014 can this tech help? Scholz, who also serves as finance minister, said Germany must embrace pioneering technology to fight climate change. \"We can do this because we have the economic capabilities and the engineers,\" he said after an SPD leadership meeting in Berlin on Monday. Scholz said investment in technology would allow Germany to maintain a strong economy and offer job opportunities, and continue its export success. And he has supporters within the SPD. \"If we set the right course, then climate protection in the medium term can be better than any economic stimulus package,\" acting party chief Malu Dreyer said. Groups at the protest included #FridaysForFuture, an environmental protest movement started by activist Greta Thunberg. She sat outside the Swedish Parliament every day demanding the government take action on climate change. Her example soon sparked international school strikes. Other key groups in attendance were Greenpeace, cyclist-safety visibility group Critical Mass and Extinction Rebellion. Critical Mass is a cyclists' environmental protest bicycle ride. It started in 1992 in San Francisco, and now Critical Mass groups are found all over the world. They organize rides in large groups that often block roads to make car drivers aware of cyclists. The Critical Mass website speaks of a \"cycling culture that refuses to take a back seat to motorists.\" Greenpeace is a non-violent environmental activist group. The organization has set out a plan for the world to be on track by 2020 to keep global climate change below 1.5\u00b0 C. Among other aims, the group hopes to tackle environmental degradation of forests and oceans. Evidence has towards the combustion engine's contribution to increasing global temperatures. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) study on car transport, commissioned by Greenpeace Belgium, concluded that to achieve a 66% likelihood of keeping global warming below 1.5\u00b0C, diesel and petrol cars must be rapidly phased out in Europe with an end to new sales by 2025. Air pollution is another target for environmental activists. Air pollution has reached dangerous levels in many cities across the world and there is mounting research on the damage it inflicts on humans and fetuses. According to the Greenpeace \"Crashing the Climate\" report into the effect of the car industry on the environment, SUVs are particularly damaging to the environment. Due to their higher weight and less aerodynamic body, SUVs produce significantly higher CO2 emissions than other cars. Many protesters and environment groups think that governments have been too slow to enact meaningful change to ensure the Earth's temperature doesn't rise above the 2\u00b0C benchmark set by climate scientists.  Author: Kate Martyr 'Mix of instruments' Merkel's political career is drawing to a close. Will she be remembered for her failure in getting Germany to meet its own emission targets? Or will she go down in history as the \"Climate Chancellor?\" Scholz has his eyes on the SPD leadership, and he would likely have to keep his party in the governing coalition with the CDU and its allied Bavarian party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). That would be no easy task for Scholz. A majority of SPD members are now against staying in the grand coalition, known as the \"GroKo.\" Scholz has remained loyal to the GroKo, and a large climate package could score him points within the SPD and enable him to seize the party's reins. Read more : Merkel's government delivers on promises, but voters aren't convinced So far, only general outlines of the package are known; the finer details are yet to be unveiled. Environment Minister Svenja Schulze (SPD) said it would be a \"mix of instruments.\" \"We will adopt an agenda with a wide range of measures,\" she said, \"but all of which will steer in the same direction, namely to reduce CO2.\" A central component in the strategy to reduce CO2 is financial incentives \u2014 especially for transport and building construction. Germans who invest in new windows, roofs or heating systems and want to make their house more climate-friendly can likely look forward to a tax reduction, and a bonus for scrapping oil-powered heating systems. Transforming transport The government intends to put 7 million electric cars on the roads and incentivize buyers with a bonus of several thousand euros. Millions of additional charging stations are to be built to power the vehicles. A fundamental element is a shift toward rail travel. To this end, the value-added tax (VAT) on train tickets will be lowered, and local public transport systems expanded. The CDU wants to double the tax on airline tickets to almost \u20ac15 ($16.50), and extend the levy on freight transport to all roads in Germany. Read more : German issues in a nutshell: 'Energiewende' Though the CDU and CSU are focusing on emissions trading and a market-based solution for CO2 pricing, the SPD is demanding higher energy taxes. \"In the future, anyone who pollutes the environment more than those who care for it will simply have to pay more,\" said Dreyer, the acting SPD head. \"Those who conserve the environment should benefit financially from doing so,\" she added. The SPD insists that climate change measures must not squeeze low-income earners. \"We are aware of the worries about rapid and expensive changes,\" Dreyer said. Dreyer pledged that the SPD will see \"that things remain equal and fair.\" Cutbacks or debt? The costs of the measures are expected to be high, but, at the same time, politicians are insisting that the average person should bear as little of the burden as possible. \"The truth is that climate protection cannot be achieved at zero cost,\" Scholz said. \"This applies to both the federal budget and to citizens.\" Svenja Scholz, Malu Dreyer and Olaf Scholz want Germany to invest in climate protection As finance minister, Scholz has set out the 2020 federal budget without earmarking any new debts. Can this be maintained? Scholz said additional revenue from cost increases tied to CO2 emissions would create \"more room to maneuver than one might think.\" But he has been crunching the numbers with his coalition partners in mind. The CSU/CDU are unwilling to sacrifice the \"black zero\" of a balanced budget under any circumstances \u2014 not even to protect the climate. That is why the debate within the CDU has become such a heated one: The party leadership maintains that if extra environmental costs are necessary, they must be absorbed by making cutbacks elsewhere. Read more : German 'meat tax' on the table to protect the climate For the SPD, slashing public spending to earmark funds for the environment is not an option. Though Scholz still officially toes the line of the \"black zero\" policy, a majority in his party have no problem with increasing spending, especially as there are no laws that require the federal budget be balanced. In 2011, Germany's constitution, the Basic Law, was amended to strictly limit government deficit. But it still allows an additional spending margin totalling 0.35% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Currently that would amount to \u20ac12 billion per year \u2014 an amount that would certainly help finance the climate package. And now even business leaders are advocating that the \"black zero\" should not be maintained at all costs. The Greens want to go a step further: Party co-leader Robert Habeck called the debt brake a hangover from a time when high-interest rates limited the capacity for political action. Habeck demands that the debt threshold be adjusted in line with the guidelines for European stability. He calculates that this would amount to \u20ac30-35 billion yearly for additional \"financial scope.\" \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Is Germany too stingy to fund the fight against climate change?", "article_name": "is-germany-too-stingy-to-fund-the-fight-against-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/is-germany-too-stingy-to-fund-the-fight-against-climate-change/a-50452781", "date_published": "2019-09-20 00:00:00", "article_length": 8991, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:02:37.003355"}
{"id": null, "body": "     As climate change concerns grow, a new survey has found most Germans support raising flight prices and other measures to protect the planet. The Greens are currently polling on par with Angela Merkel's conservatives. A majority of people in Germany support taking drastic steps to combat climate change, according to a survey published on Thursday. More than 70% of participants in the Deutschlandtrend opinion poll for public broadcaster ARD by Infratest dimap said they think raising prices on flights makes sense. Some 60% said they support getting rid of combustible engines in cars, while 97% backed expanding renewable energy. But there still appears to be strong resistance to introducing a carbon tax, with only 35% of participants behind the measure. Concern over climate change has been growing in Germany, particularly in the wake of the latest heat wave in July which saw record-breaking temperatures \u00a0across Europe. As a result, the Green party has seen a boost of support and is currently polling at 26% with voters, according to the poll. The environmentalist party is now currently tied with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU bloc, which rose to 26% of support this week. Russia more trustworthy than US With Boris Johnson becoming the UK's new prime minister and with the United States pressuring Germany to take part in a naval operation in the Persian Gulf, many survey participants said the countries are not good partners for Germany. Only 37% of participants said the UK was trustworthy, dropping sharply from a previous survey in February. Russia and the US both ranked low, although respondents said Moscow is more trustworthy than Washington \u2014 with 28% saying Russia is trustworthy, compared to 19% for the US. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticizing Germany for its defense spending, \u00a0and\u00a0Deutschlandtrend\u00a0also asked what respondents thought about increasing funding for Germany's military. Boosting funds for the Bundeswehr was backed by respondents who support the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), the center-right CDU/CSU\u00a0and\u00a0the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).

{"id": null, "body": "     140 countries, 140 diets, 140 different ways each of them contributes to climate change. A new US-study looked at what dietary changes need to happen across the globe to mitigate the effects of climate change. October 16 marks World Food Day this year, a day\u00a0 celebrated every year by the\u00a0United Nations'\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). World Food Day is\u00a0a call\u00a0to make healthy and sustainable diets affordable and accessible for everyone, while nurturing the planet at the same time. But how can this be achieved? One way, according to a new study,\u00a0would be to introduce different ways for countries across the world to adapt their diets. Researchers at the US-based Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future looked at diets in 140 countries across the world and measured the ecological impact of their food production in order to identify ways to mitigate climate change. The study, called \"Country-specific dietary shifts to mitigate climate and water crises\" ,\u00a0 found that an important first step would be to shift Europe and the United States away from a diet heavy in meat and dairy. But study co-author, Martin Bloem,\u00a0notes\u00a0that the\u00a0solutions needed are not one-size-fits-all. \"The situation for poorer countries is not the same as for high-income countries and the solutions for high-income countries are much more straight-forward,\" Bloem said. Read more: The global injustice of the climate crisis \"People in the West need to start eating less meat; that will already have quite some impact,\" says Bloem Could drinking less milk help save the planet? Why meat and dairy are bad for the climate Livestock are responsible for almost 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the FAO . Cattle is the biggest culprit. Raised for both beef and milk, cows represent about 65% of the livestock sector's emissions, followed by pork (9%), buffalo milk (8%), and poultry\u00a0and eggs (8%). A byproduct of cow digestion is\u00a0methane (CH4) and\u00a0accounts for the majority of livestock emissions. The greenhouse gas is estimated to be at least 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. But livestock production is also responsible for other greenhouse gas emissions, such as nitrous oxide (N20) and carbon dioxide (CO2), mainly through the production of their feed, which often involves large applications of nitrogen-based fertilizers. The opposite approach to combat hunger? But with over 800 million people still going hungry every day, impact on the climate cannot be the only guide for what people eat, the study points out. Animal source foods, specifically milk and eggs, are in fact a valuable source of protein and nutrients like\u00a0calcium, which are especially important for young children and pregnant women. Read more: Pakistan struggling to eradicate malnutrition in children \"Some countries, such as Indonesia, India and most of the African countries may actually need to dramatically increase their greenhouse gas emissions and water use, because they have to combat hunger and stunting,\"\u00a0Bloem said. In these countries, there is still a 40% rate of stunting, a side effect of undernutrition that results in lower than average growth in children. Martin Bloem is the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future and co-authored the study Stunting also has a major, long-term impact on the cognitive abilities of the children. \"It's irreversible by the age of two, so stunting has huge implications for the human capital in those countries. That's why it's very critical that we prevent stunting and we need animal source foods for that,\"\u00a0Bloem said. \"We cannot keep that out of the equation when talking about climate protection.\"\u00a0 Another solution, according to Bloem, would be to fortify certain products, like cereal. This would help reduce the need to get nutrients through animal products. It's a practice already in use in many developed countries, but so far hasn't been applied in many poorer countries. Fish could make all the difference Diets in which protein came predominantly from low food chain animals \u2013\u00a0such as small fish and mollusks \u2013 were found to have nearly as low of an environmental impact as a vegan diet. Poor countries in particular depend on small fish for their protein intake \"Small fish are really critical for poor people, particularly in Africa and Asia, as that's one of the main sources for protein and calcium, because the milk intake is very low in those countries,\"\u00a0Bloem said. \"But 80% of all the fish produced nowadays actually comes from Asia and is imported in Europe and the US. And the feed for some of these bigger fish we import are actually those smaller fish, which means the poorer people have no more access to this vital source of protein and calcium.\"\u00a0 Researchers also determined that a diet that reduced\u00a0animal food consumption by two-thirds \u2013\u00a0termed by study authors as going\u00a0 \"two-thirds vegan\" \u2013\u00a0generally had a lower climate and water footprint than\u00a0vegetarian diets\u00a0that included\u00a0eggs and diary, but not fish.\u00a0 Where you get your food from matters Researchers also found that local production wasn't always the best way to go from a climate perspective. It may be better for the environment to produce food in countries that have more efficient technology, says Bloem \"We need to start being creative and create delicious dishes that don't include animal-based products,\" according to Bloem The production of one pound (0.45 kilograms) of beef in Paraguay, for instance, contributes nearly 17 times more greenhouse gases than one pound of beef produced in Denmark.\u00a0Often, this disparity came from\u00a0deforestation to create grazing land, according to the study. \"So a food's country of origin can have enormous consequences for the climate,\"\u00a0Bloem said. \"In Europe the soil is much more fertile, for instance, which makes the production there more efficient. So trade could actually be good for the climate if food is produced in places where the climate impact is the lowest,\" Bloem said, adding that this is the case even when emissions from transportation are factored in. The study concludes that middle- and low-income countries need to be guided and supported by developed countries to avoid environmental mistakes the planet is already paying for.\u00a0 \"It needs to be a close collaboration between developed and developing countries. It's a joint problem. We are all in this together,\"\u00a0Bloem said. Another way industrialized countries could reduce their impact on the climate is reducing food waste \u2014 one-third of all food produced worldwide ends up in the bin, with Europeans on average throwing away 95 kilograms (209 lbs) of food per person, per year. In low-income African countries south of the Sahara, it's only 6\u00a0kilograms (13 lbs). Context is key But despite the findings, one key conclusion of the report is that there aren't always straight-forward answers, according to Bloem. \"That's why we conducted analyses in all these different countries so that you can see what the most optimal way is for each individual country \u2013 but also the entire world to deal with diets and health criteria, as well as climate and sustainability,\"\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u00a0 In the end, the study came up with nine plant-forward diets, ranging from no red meat to pescatarian (a vegetarian diet that includes seafood), lacto-ovo vegetarian (a vegetarian diet that includes dairy and eggs), to vegan, which are to be presented to policymakers in each country.\u00a0 At the same time, the study urges people in the Western world to do more.\u00a0 Baby boomers in the developed world, for instance, on average\u00a0spend less than 10% of their income on food, while the same generation in countries like Nigeria, Kenya or Bangladesh spends 50 to 60% of their income on food, according to Bloem. \"For us in the Western world, we can pay more for our food so that we can pay for the unintended consequences.\" With everything from meat contamination scandals to concerns about agriculture's climate change impact in the news these days, more and more people are turning to a vegan diet. But, there are other ways to eat in an environmentally-friendly way too. Free-range meat products are now commonplace. Rarely, though, are cows raised in such a paradise as this alpine meadow. In the 1970s and 80s, eating vegetarian, and especially vegan \u2014 abstaining from animal products completely, like milk and eggs \u2014 was not part of the mainstream. Nowadays, things are changing. Jonathan Safran Foer's book \"Eating Animals\" sparked thought about the meat people eat. More vegan restaurants are sprouting up all over the place; here are some dishes from 'P\u00eale-M\u00eale' in Berlin. Eating vegan can reduce carbon footprints and water usage worldwide. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that the meat industry generates nearly one-fifth of human-made greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Scientists also say that 13,000 to 15,000 liters of water are needed to produce just one kilogram of beef. With the recent scandal surrounding Dutch horsemeat being sold as beef, more Europeans are now simply choosing to eat meat less. But, for those that can't do without, the \"Meine kleine Farm\" (My little farm) concept tries to achieve transparency with consumers. It aims to give each animal it sells as meat a proper identity. The Potsdam-based farm has a website showing the living conditions of the animals and giving customers a chance to vote online about which animal they want slaughtered next. Since they mainly sell to customers in the nearby region, the 'Meine kleine Farm' project also helps to keep transportation routes \u2014 and thus greenhouse gases \u2014 to a minimum. Eating locally and in season also helps reduce greenhouse gases because it cuts out long transportation routes. Canadians Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon argued for local cuisine in their book, \"100-mile diet: A year of local eating.\" The couple spent one year eating foods from within one hundred miles of their home. Self-preserved foods got them through the winter. The modern industrial agriculture practice of cultivating monocultures, such as corn and soy, can make the crops more susceptible to pests and diseases. This, in turn, promotes the widespread use of pesticides. Small-scale farmers, on the other hand, often promote crop diversity which makes plants naturally more robust, even in periods of drought. Cultivating one's own crops is possible even in big cities, as shown by the \"Princess Garden\" project right in the middle of Germany's capital, Berlin. Crops are grown and consumed locally, with food dishes offered as business lunches at an on-site caf\u00e9. The urban farmers here say gardening raises awareness about the environment and, since the garden is shared, they make friends along the way too. With Germans throwing away an estimated 20 million tons of food a year, food-sharing has become one of the latest environmentally-friendly trends. Restaurants or grocery stores donate still-edible food that they can no longer use to charity organizations. Foodsharing.de is an internet portal where people can swap food they won't be able to eat. Many dietary experts argue that a vegetarian or vegan diet can be good for your health too. Various studies show that a decrease in daily meat consumption may reduce the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Author: Louisa Schaefer If you want to save the world, go veggie seems to be the motto. But even though dietary decisions are proven to reduce CO2 emissions, young Germans are still eating a lot of meat. (12.08.2019)\n\u00a0 Funny as it may sound, belching and flatulent cows are a serious contributor to the emissions that threaten our planet's climate. But the cows on one cattle farm in India are doing their part to pass less gas.

{"id": null, "body": "     Despite stronger storms and hotter heat waves, world leaders have not spent enough money adapting to the 'new climate reality'. The longer countries delay cutting emissions, the more citizens will have to pay cleaning up its costs World leaders and businesses are not putting enough money into adapting to dangerous changes in the climate and must \"urgently step up action,\"\u00a0according to a report published Thursday by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Last year was the joint-hottest year on record and disasters struck every continent. Smoke-belching wildfires burned through communities from Australia to the Arctic. Extreme storms \u00a0battered coastal cities from the Philippines to Nicaragua, while floods put a third of Bangladesh underwater and covered entire villages in Nigeria. Extreme weather and climate-related disasters have killed more than 410,000 people in the past 10\u00a0years, almost all of them in poorer countries, according to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Crescent. \"The hard truth is that climate change is upon us,\" said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen , in the foreword to the report. \"Its impacts will intensify, even if we limit global warming. We cannot afford to lose the race to adaptation.\" Early-warning systems and coastal defenses reduced the death toll from Typhoon Lekima in 2019 Heatwaves can be deadly for older people and those without access to air conditioning and shade The Adaptation Gap Report, now in its 5th year, finds \"huge gaps\" between what world leaders agreed to do under the 2015 Paris Agreement and what they need to do to keep their citizens safe from climate change. A review by the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative of almost 1,700 examples of climate adaptation found that a third were in the early stages of implementation \u2014 and only 3% had reached the point of reducing risks. Disasters like storms and droughts have grown stronger than they should be because people have warmed the planet by burning fossil fuels and chopping down rainforests. The world has heated by more than 1.1 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution and is on track to warm by about 3\u00b0C by the end of the century. If world leaders deliver on recent pledges to bring emissions to net-zero by the middle of the century, they could almost limit warming to 2\u00b0C. The target of the Paris Agreement, however, is to reach a target well below that \u2014 ideally 1.5\u00b0C.\u00a0 There are two ways, scientists say, to lessen the pain that warming will bring: mitigating climate change by cutting carbon pollution and adapting to the hotter, less stable world it brings. About three-quarters of the world's countries have national plans to adapt to climate change, according to the report, but most lack the regulations, incentives and funding to make them work. More than a decade ago, rich countries most responsible for climate change pledged to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 in climate finance for poorer countries. UNEP says it is \"impossible to answer\" whether that goal has been met, while an OECD study published in November found that between 2013 and 2018, the target sum had not once been achieved. Even in 2018, which recorded the highest level of contributions, rich countries were still $20 billion short. The yearly adaptation costs for developing countries alone are estimated at $70 billion (\u20ac57.6 billion). This figure is expected to at least double by the end of the decade as temperatures rise, and will hit $280-500 billion by 2050, according to the report. But failing to adapt is even more expensive. When powerful storms like cyclones Fani and Bulbul struck South Asia, early-warning systems allowed governments to move millions of people out of danger at short notice. Storms of similar strength that have hit East Africa, like cyclones Idai and Kenneth, have proved more deadly\u00a0because fewer people were evacuated before disaster struck. The Global Commission on Adaptation estimated in 2019 that a $1.8 trillion investment in early warning systems, buildings, agriculture, mangroves and water resources could reap $7.1 trillion in benefits from economic activity and avoided costs when disasters strike. Soldiers in China evacuated 100,000 people after heavy rains wreaked havoc along the Yangtze River in August The indirect effects of climate change, like locust swarms in East Africa that grew after heavy storms, can put entire food systems at risk The report also highlights how restoring nature can protect people from climate change while benefiting local communities and ecology. Wildfires , for instance, could be made less punishing by restoring grasslands and regularly burning the land in controlled settings. Indigenous communities from Australia to Canada have done this for millennia in a way that encourages plant growth while reducing the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. Reforestation, meanwhile, can stop soil erosion and flooding during heavy rainfall while trapping carbon and protecting wildlife. In countries like Brazil and Malaysia, governments could better protect coastal homes from floods and storms by restoring mangroves \u00a0\u2014 tangled trees that grow in tropical swamps. As well as anchoring sediments and absorbing the crash of waves, mangroves can store carbon, help fish populations grow and boost local economies through tourism.\u00a0\u00a0 Reforestation can benefit the ground and the climate in many ways Mangroves can absorb CO2 as well as the shock of coastal flooding While nature-based solutions are often cheaper than building hard infrastructure, their funding makes up a \"tiny fraction\" of adaptation finance, the report authors wrote. An analysis of four global climate funds that spent $94 billion on adaptation projects found that just $12 billion went to nature-based solutions and little of this was spent implementing projects on the ground. But little is known about their long-term effectiveness. At higher temperatures, the effects of climate change may be so great that they overwhelm natural defenses like mangroves. By 2050, coastal floods \u00a0that used to hit once a century will strike many cities every year, according to a 2019 report on oceans by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the gold standard on climate science. This could force dense cities on low-lying coasts to build higher sea walls, like in Indonesia and South Korea, or evacuate entire communities from sinking islands, like in Fiji. It's not a case of replacing infrastructure, said Matthias Garschagen, a geographer at Ludwig Maximilian University in Germany and IPCC author, who was not involved in the UNEP report. \"The case for nature-based solutions is often misinterpreted as a battle... but they're part of a toolkit that we've ignored for too long.\" The vast majority of the Earth's water is found in the ocean. But only a fragment of the planet's water \u2013 roughly 0.01% \u2013 flows through its rivers. And without these rivers, many other sources of surface water, like lakes and wetlands, would run dry. This is becoming a problem with climate change, and it's posing a threat to humans and animals alike in varied and, sometimes, unexpected ways. The dramatic effects of climate change aren\u2019t a recent phenomenon. Lake Chad, shown here in 1963, 1973, 1987 and 1997, has shrunk from roughly 25,000 km2 to under 2,000 km2 over the past 60 years. Long blamed on dams and irrigation, researchers have found that its water loss also comes from fluctuating temperatures which have negatively impacted its second most important river, the Komadugu Yobe. Lake Chad is a stark example of how climate change is forcing people to search for new sources of water and food. The region has seen a rise in tensions as farmers and cattle herders move towards richer land. But other continents just now feeling the pressure of climate change are starting to see their fish stocks unsuited to warmer waters \u2013 and their waters evaporating in the heat. Europe is one of these places. In the summer of 2018, the mighty Rhine River went from a powerful current to a gentle stream when temperatures soared past 30C (86F) and drought left the otherwise lush, rainy habitat too low to accommodate more than one lane of shipping. Other regions of the world are also coming to terms with what they once considered reliable water sources, like glaciers. Known as the world's water towers for their ability to reliably store large amounts of snow and ice, glaciers supply nearly 2 billion people with water. Experts fear the Himalayas, seen here, will lose a third of their volume by the end of the century. Farmers in the Indus River Basin, pictured above, are dependent on glacier melt from the Himalayas for crops like rice and cotton. They're part of a larger river basin in South Asia, which includes the Ganges and Brahmaptura Rivers. In total, these three waterways sustain roughly 129 million farmers and a total of 900 million residents with water. Unprecedented wildfires across the globe, as seen here in Australia, have been yet another side effect of climate change. The aftermath of the fires could prove toxic for Australia's most important watershed, the Murray-Darling water basin. Ash washed into the rivers that feed into the basin threaten to turn the water toxic for the 2.6 million Australians, not to mention many native species. It's not just ash and sediment from wildfires that can choke up the water. Heavier rainfall associated with extreme weather in the US, has been sweeping more runoff pollution from farms, for example, into the rivers, which then carry it to the open sea. Algal blooms like this one off of the coast of New York is one result. Another result is a dead zone, or an area deprived of oxygen by pollution. In fact, nitrogen pollution has also become a big problem for the Mississippi River, which runs through many US states. Besides a higher volume of nitrogen being washed into the water through flooding, increasingly powerful hurricanes connected to climate change are hurting the river's wetlands, which protect it from storm surges.

{"id": null, "body": "     With COP26 underway, the climate crisis is in the spotlight. Here are the most important facts relating to how our planet has been changing. Over 100 years of man-made CO2 emissions have changed the planet World leaders are meeting for the 26th time to address the causes and effects of climate change. These five questions and answers show how much our planet has already changed. Governments are increasingly pledging to transform their economies to become carbon neutral within the next 10 to 30 years. With emissions stabilizing in Europe and the Americas and rising in Asia and Africa, the following chart shows how much of an economic turnaround\u00a0 carbon neutrality would need. Absolute emissions, however, only tell\u00a0half the story. Countries in Asia have seen immense population growth over the last decades, and more people leads to greater consumption of resources . Seen from a CO2 per capita perspective, the picture is very different. Factoring in population size puts the spotlight on both Western countries like the US and Australia, as well as nations in other parts of the world, including Russia, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Mongolia. In the discussion about who should contribute most to emissions reductions, experts argue that not all nations can be held equally responsible , and that economic power and wealth should be taken into account. Clustering countries in terms of income groups (see below) shows a connection between higher levels of income and higher median emissions per capita. It also reveals how countries within each group vary widely, and that the higher the income group, the wider the spread across the emissions spectrum. High income countries with elevated emissions, such as Qatar, emit much more CO2 per capita than countries like Germany and France, although they are in the same income group. And although countries like India and China rank low on per capita emissions, their decisions still have a big impact, given their huge population numbers (bubble size). Given the correlation between economic strength and CO2 emissions, it's no surprise that the industrial sector is responsible for the lion's share (35%) of overall greenhouse gases (GHG) \u2014 including methane and nitrous oxide \u2014 released into the atmosphere. \u00a0At 20%, agriculture, forestry and change in land use collectively account for the second greatest source of GHG emissions. Over the last two decades, the annual amount of tree cover lost has gradually increased. Russia, Brazil and the United States were the world's biggest drivers of deforestation in 2020. Compared to the decade from 1990-2000, however, the rate of deforestation has slowed. Deforestation is not only problematic because the CO2 previously stored in the ground and the trees themselves is released into the atmosphere, but also because forests and soils are \"carbon sinks\" that absorb atmospheric CO2 \u2014 making them a valuable tool\u00a0in the fight against climate change. CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels have been on the rise since the early days of industrialization. However, as humans produced higher levels of carbon dioxide, Earth absorbed it in natural \" carbon sinks ,\" such as forests and oceans. But as humanity began to produce more CO2 and other greenhouse gases than the planet's ecosystem could naturally absorb, more of those emissions became trapped in the atmosphere (red area in the following chart). An increasing volume of CO2 particles traps the sunlight's warmth in the atmosphere, acting like a greenhouse in which it gets warmer and warmer. Compared to the 20th century \u2014 and the past five years in particular \u2014 the average global temperature has increased by almost 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit).  This change is measured by calculating the difference between temperatures observed at a specific time and place and the historical average for that same spot. The 1\u00a0degree increase in temperature is the global average of those variations. The difference can be much greater on a local level. In a more concrete example,\u00a0the average August temperature in the northwestern US city of Portland\u00a0was around 20 C from 1991 to 2020.\u00a0With global warming, Portland is seeing hotter-than-average days. On August 13, for example, the daily average reached 30 C, which was an extreme temperature anomaly. In the same week, unusual temperatures were recorded in Spain, Tunisia, Russia, India, Cambodia, Australia and Argentina, to name just a few countries. Such temperature increases push Earth's temperature anomaly up and will have potentially wide-ranging effects \u2014 from pockets of impossible heat to failing harvests and an increase in dangerous events like storms and floods. A\u00a0rise in sea levels is among the most noticeable impacts . Hotter temperatures are melting ice caps and glaciers and increasing the total amount of water in the oceans. According to data compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States government climate research agency, sea levels have risen nearly 25 centimeters (9.8 inches)\u00a0in the last 140 years. Around one third of that increase happened in the last 25 years alone. Sea levels \u00a0are rising worldwide, but the trend is accentuated in the Arctic, which is heating faster than other regions. The thermal property of water that allows it to expand when warmer\u00a0is also contributing to\u00a0rising sea levels. As usual, there is a caveat to the absolute numbers. While most of the world's oceans and seas are indeed higher their historical levels, some areas are more affected than others. Tide gauges in western Canada and northern Chile, for example, detect steady or even receding seas, whereas island countries in the southern Pacific and Indian oceans are witnessing alarming increases in levels \u2014 threats that could\u00a0 lead to them literally disappearing beneath the waves . With the UN climate conference poised to start in Glasgow next week, DW looks at what has \u2014 and has not \u2014 been achieved over the past quarter century of such global gatherings.\n\u00a0 There are clear pathways for world leaders to honor their pledges to stop global heating at the UN climate summit this week.\n\u00a0 Bogs, ponds and peatlands don't get the attention they deserve.

{"id": null, "body": "     The United Nations Security Council has for the first time admitted that global warming poses a major threat to world security and peace. The move catapults climate change higher up the global agenda. Extreme climatic events such as drought are raising the potential for conflicts What might appear self-evident to many took days of complicated discussions and negotiations at the UN Security Council in New York. But in the end, the 15 member states of the most powerful UN body agreed that a rise in global temperatures could pose a serious threat to world peace. They point out that drought, for example, could lead to conflicts over food and water. Even floods, such as the devastating one last year in Pakistan, or a rise in sea levels could threaten the very survival of island nations. An important step forward It was the first time in four years that the Security Council formally debated the environment. And it was the first-ever Council statement - at the insistence of this month's council president, Germany - linking climate change to global peace and security. The final statement expressed \"concern that possible adverse effects of climate change may, in the long run, aggravate certain existing threats to international peace and security.\" Germany's ambassador to the UN, Peter Wittig, pressed for the climate declaration It also requested UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to include information on possible climate change impacts in his regular reports on global trouble-spots. The statement does not amount to a resolution, rather it reflects a position by this month's council president, German Ambassador Peter Wittig. But it still is a breakthrough because it's the first time that the Security Council has officially admitted the possible security and political dimensions of climate change. The declaration had to be voted on by all the 15 member states. In 2007, a similar initiative under the presidency of Britain failed to get the necessary backing. \u2018An unholy brew' Whether it's an exodus of refugees, conflicts over water and food or rising sea levels, scientists have long been warning about the possible security risks of climate change. On Wednesday, UN chief Ban Ki-moon too sounded the alarm about the risks associated with rising temperatures. \"Extreme weather events continue to grow more frequent and intense in rich and poor countries alike, not only devastating lives, but also infrastructure, institutions, and budgets - an unholy brew which can create dangerous security vacuums,\" he told a Security Council debate on the issue. Also on Wednesday, the UN declared a famine in parts of war-torn Somalia. It was a sad but effective illustration of the possible links between climate change, drought, food shortages and security. Political wrangling The climate statement in New York was preceded by heated debates and wrangling about the right formulation. There was disagreement whether climate change alone could trigger strife or whether it \"only\" aggravated existing potential for conflict - a view long accepted by the US defense department and other experts. Somalia is struggling with food shortages and armed conflict The answer to that may not make a difference to the victims of climate change. But it does to the heavyweights at the negotiating table. The fact that countries such as China and especially Russia tried to prevent the declaration is proof of its significance. China wants to \"leave climate change to the experts\" and would prefer to see it discussed only in connection with sustainable development and not on the agenda of the powerful Security Council. Russia, in particular, tried to block the German-led declaration and keep it out of the Council. \"We believe that involving the Security Council in a regular review of the issue of climate change will not bring any added value whatsoever and will merely lead to further increased politicisation of this issue and increased disagreements between countries,\" Russian envoy Alexander Pankin argued. Security concerns But there's no doubt that climate change will enjoy a higher priority once it moves to the security agenda. In the fight over funds and resources, it would appear to be an advantage if the powerful nations of the world view climate change as a possible threat to world security. The UN Security Council declaration isn't as strong as Germany, the US, European countries and island nations would have liked and UN procedures are notoriously long-winded. But climate change is advancing at a rapid pace and is now gradually making its way to the global stage. The international climate change negotiations seem to have stalled and it's unlikely that a successor to the Kyoto Protocol can be found fast enough to stem climate change before a dangerous level of global warming is reached. The poorest countries are already feeling the impacts of rising temperatures. Most experts agree that it can only be good news for the climate if it makes it to the top of the Security Council's agenda and is given a different priority under mounting global pressure.

{"id": null, "body": "     In 2017, parts of Europe, Canada and the US were ravaged by wildfires on an unprecedented scale. In 2018, new records are being set around the world as hot, dry temperatures and fires become the new normal. Almost 20 fires have ravaged California over the past two months. Some are still blazing. The region is experiencing earlier, longer and more ferocious wildfire seasons due to increasingly hot, dry temperatures. In 2017, more than\u00a0a dozen massive blazes\u00a0swept through Northern California, killing 41 people, destroying 6,000 homes and devastating the area's celebrated wine country . Up until then, this had been the deadliest and most destructive series of fires in California's\u00a0history. This year, the Ferguson Fire has devastated Yosemite National Park in California, while the more northerly\u00a0 Carr Fire has burned more than 220,000 acres (81,000 hectares), 1,079\u00a0homes and 500 buildings. The largest fire blanketing the region in smoke, however, is the Mendocino complex \u2014\u00a0a merger of two fires \u2014 which has burned more than 415,000 acres of northern California, 157\u00a0homes and 120\u00a0other buildings. This makes it the largest fire in the state\u2019s history, surpassing the Thomas Fire of December 2017. In the wake of the wildfires of 2017, this year's blazes might seem more normal\u00a0\u2014 but that certainly doesn't make them any less terrifying. And as far as the future is concerned, there doesn't seem to be an end in sight to the fires sweeping the globe. Deadly consequences Six firefighters have died battling Californian fires in 2018, according to state authorities. A national disaster was declared in Northern California on August 4. Off the back of the record-breaking $2.7 billion (\u20ac2.2 billion) the state of California\u00a0spent fighting fires in 2017, in 2018 the state managed to spend one-fourth of its emergency funding on firefighting by the end of July. Across the Atlantic, an intense summer heat wave across Europe created fertile ground for fires. More than 80 people died in Greece in July, as the country's worst wildfire in a decade razed the small resort of Mati, about 28 kilometers (17 miles) east of Athens. Thousands were evacuated and more than 1,500 homes were damaged, and many destroyed. In Spain's Valencia region, some 2,500 people fled their homes to escape fires that swept across nearly 2,500 acres. In neighboring Portugal, a major fire broke out in Monchique, in Algarve, during\u00a0early August as temperatures climbed to the mid-40s Celsius (100+ Fahrenheit). Read more: Current heat waves are linked to climate change, scientists confirm The Carr Fire in California has burned more than 200,000 acres Even parts of the Arctic, where summer temperatures have been 10 degrees Celsius higher than average, have been on fire. Also typically temperate Scandivian and Baltic countries were set ablaze. Throughout July, Sweden experienced some of its worst fires in decades and the hottest July in 250 years, according to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency. Norway, Finland and Latvia \u00a0have also been fighting flames. Canada's province of British Columbia declared a state of emergency on August 15 as hundreds of wildfires burned across the region. Thousands have been evacuated and more than 600,000 acres have gone up in flames. In 2017, Alberta and British Columbia endured the worse fire season since records began, with more than 3.11 million acres having burned by mid-October. Sweden endured its hottest July in 250 years this summer Future droughts 'locked in' While forest fires are invariably sparked by lightning or people (either carelessly or deliberately), they are being driven by heat waves that climate scientists warn may soon be the norm , especially since\u00a0climate researchers are forecasting more hot years to come . \"Wildfires are a natural feature of summers, but climate change is increasing the risk,\"\u00a0Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, told DW. Read more: Great southern drought: Australian farmers crippled, climate action stalled One major wildfire propellant is drought. The winter preceding the 2018 fire season in California in particular was\u00a0\"very dry,\"\u00a0Ward said. \"Droughts are a factor that mean\u00a0you're more likely to generate dry wood, which is fuel for fires.\" With regard to\u00a0Greece, for example, \"there's very clear evidence the northern Mediterranean countries are experiencing more frequent and intense droughts, and that's down to climate change.\" According to Ward, we now have \"no control\" over the occurrence of droughts for \"the next three or four decades because they are locked in by the concentration of greenhouse gases that have already built up.\" So have the past two years been record wildfire years? Land management also plays a role in the spread of fires Tough competition It's certainly been an intense couple of years for fires in Europe and North America. Even so, Martin Wooster, professor of earth observation science at King's College London, said other parts of the world have seen worse over the past decade. In 2015, drought caused by the El Nino weather system created lethal conditions for Indonesian forests and peatlands \u00a0already degraded by draining and logging. The smoldering peat \u2014\u00a0ancient, decayed vegetable matter condensed into a carbon-heavy fuel \u2014\u00a0kept fires burning for months on end. \"This led to huge fires, far bigger than any seen in Europe, and some of the worst air pollution ever experienced,\" Wooster said. NASA satellite imagery for 2018 shows regions around the entire world on fire Numerous factors Despite this, there does appear to be a distinct trend, as fire seasons become\u00a0longer\u00a0and more intense. \"In\u00a0the western United States, the general perception is that there is no wildfire season any more, but that it's continuous all year round,\" Kevin Trenberth, a scientist at the Climate Analysis Section of\u00a0the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the US, told DW.\u00a0 In many parts of the world, wildfires are part of a natural cycle. Savannas, for example, are maintained by fire. Some trees not only survive fires\u00a0but need them to release their seeds. Human intervention can disrupt these cycles, the scientific discipline of forest ecology has found. Logging of old-growth forest is also a factor that has increased the risk of catastrophic wildfire. Since large, older trees are likely to have survived fires, they are more resistant than smaller, younger ones. When second-growth forests do burn, the smaller trees can carry flames to the upper canopy, making the older giants more susceptible. A charred neighborhood destroyed by the Carr Fire Putting out small fires can allow\u00a0flammable debris to accumulate\u00a0until a colossal fire\u00a0starts that cannot be controlled. \"One thing that can increase the risk of big fires, ironically, is the suppression of\u00a0 fires,\"\u00a0Ward said. Allowing small fires to burn, and to control them, is effective because you \"get rid of the dry wood,\" he added. \"If you don't, eventually you get a fire that is much bigger and more destructive.\" Global warming is certainly resulting in hotter, drier conditions making such infernos more common, even with careful forest management. Different climatic conditions also mean forests can take far longer to recover. Meanwhile, fire cycles are also beginning in areas like the tropics that have no natural fire ecology. Human fingerprints Climate change isn't the only human-induced element. Fires can also be started by careless people dropping cigarettes,\u00a0letting campfires burn out of control, and are fueled by poor land management . For this reason, Ward cautioned that in addition to reducing emissions to lessen drought, governments need to ensure the public is properly educated about wildfire risk. And people should not be\u00a0building in fire-prone\u00a0areas. \"Beyond that, we have the option \u2014 if we reduce our [greenhouse gas] emissions \u2014 of stopping that trend toward stronger and more frequent droughts. But that depends on us.\" Rescue teams are searching through charred homes and cars, going door to door looking for victims. A firefighter in the hard-hit coastal community of Mati, near Athens, saved a dog from a burning house. \"Mati no longer exists,\" said Evangelos Bournous, the mayor of nearby Rafina. Fast moving wildfires fueled by a deadly combination of dry pine trees and wind ripped through coastal areas in Attica, catching vacationers by surprise. Hundreds of people had be evacuated by boat from beaches as deadly fire and smoke encroached. Some were not so lucky and drowned in the sea. The raging wildfires have left a thick haze of smoke near Athens. Here, police direct traffic in Kineta, outside Athens. Dozens of people have been hospitalized due to smoke inhalation. Thousands of homes have been destroyed. \"People are shocked, lost. Some of them have lost everything: children, parents, homes,\" said Red Cross spokeswoman Georgia Trisbioti. Hundreds of cars were torched in the fires. Authorities expect the death toll to rise as rescue crews search through the charred remains of homes and cars.

In July, Germany recorded its highest temperature ever at 42.6 C (108 F). France broke its heat record twice in 2019, the highest temperature measuring 46.C (114.8 F) in July. Climate change increases the frequency of heat waves. In November 2019, the Italian archipelago city of Venice experienced multiple flooding events and the high water mark of 1.5 meters was reached three times in one week for the first time in recorded history. Projected sea level rise due to climate change could make these events more likely in the future. The same heat wave that brought record temperatures to France sparked the worst wildfires to hit Spain in 20 years. On the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, wildfires in August decimated a national park on the popular tourist island. Hotter temperatures and drier air due to climate change increase the risk of fires. A combination of drought, storms and extreme heat is depleting Germany's forests. According to BDF, a forest advocacy group, in Germany, more than 1 million established trees have died since 2018. \"These are no longer single unusual weather events. That is climate change,\" said a BDF representative. A glacier on the Italian side of Mont Blanc experienced accelerated melting in 2019. And enthusiasts held a \"funeral\" for the Pizol glacier in the Swiss Alps, which has almost completely disappeared. Scientists say climate change accelerates glacial melting in the Alps. Two consecutive years of drought in Germany have hit farmers hard.

{"id": null, "body": "     The science of climate change is complex, and in the era of \"fake news,\" that complexity can be used to mislead and manipulate the public and decision-makers. How do we know who to trust? The rapid deterioration of the very conditions that support life on Earth is something we should all have an interest in keeping abreast of in the news. But climate change is an extremely complex scientific problem, and tackling it is an expensive proposition in which many powerful players\u00a0stand to lose. Which means it isn't always easy to know if what you're reading in your morning paper or social media feed is entirely accurate. \"World leaders were duped into investing billions of dollars over manipulated global warming data,\" a Mail on Sunday headline shouted in February 2017. Below it, an article alleged that US government scientists had used misleading, unverified data in a report that greatly exaggerated global warming and rushed it to publication in time to sway the 2015 Paris climate talks. Read more:\u00a0 Four climate change myths, debunked One problem: The UK newspaper got its facts wrong and misrepresented the study it was criticizing. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the London School of Economics' climate research institute soon filed a formal complaint against the Mail on Sunday with the UK's press regulator, the IPSO, detailing 30 false claims in the story. \"Fake news stories about climate change are a significant threat to the public interest \u2026The expert community must continue to fight back against the deluge of propaganda from climate change deniers,\" Ward wrote. Seven months later, the IPSO ruled that the Mail on Sunday article was indeed inaccurate and misleading. The newspaper was forced to publish the regulator's adjudication above the original article, pinpointing its flaws and inaccuracies. But had the damage already been done? 'Enough to make your head spin' By the time IPSO made its ruling, the story had garnered more than 211,500 shares, likes, comments and other interactions on social media. It was picked up by climate-skeptic blogs and outlets like Fox News , Breitbart and The Daily Caller . Despite significant support for action against climate change around the world, not everyone is convinced by the evidence Those working to combat false reporting on\u00a0climate change warn that it can circulate unchecked, leading us to make lifestyle decisions and cast votes\u00a0based on untruths. That\u00a0could mean the difference between polluters living up to climate protection commitments\u00a0and President Fake News himself walking away from the 2015 Paris Agreement , a decision backed up by distorted facts and unbalanced claims. And you don't have to be willfully resistant to the realities of climate change to be befuddled by climate news. Understanding climate change involves interpreting data and parsing statistics that are confusing, to say the least. Not to mention the jargon: Ocean acidification, loss and damage, cap and trade, carbon budget, UNFCCC, IPCC, REDD \u2014 it's enough to make your head spin. Nora Kaup is an environmental technology student in Berlin. Even for her, it can be tough:\u00a0\"It's a science that sometimes only makes sense if you know the vocabulary, the background theory, or the debate about the topic,\" she told DW. Misinformation and disinformation Climate Feedback is a network of scientists that fact-checks climate change news\u00a0from outlets like Breitbart and The Daily Caller , and\u00a0also mainstream new sources such as The New York Times and National Geographic . They base their assessments on factors like factual accuracy, the quality of the sources used in the article, and whether the logic of the argument is sound. Emmanuel Vincent, a climate scientist and founder of Climate Feedback, said people increasingly get their climate news from unreliable sources. \"We may not understand the difference of who it is that really writes the news,\" Vincent told DW. \"More and more, what becomes influential online is not always written by journalists. This opening of the world of journalism to many more people, like PR people and bloggers, is bringing a lot of inaccurate information online.\" And journalists get it wrong too, misinterpreting or cherry-picking the data, or taking conclusions out of context. In cases like this, articles can be misleading even if they aren't deliberately manipulative. \"Misinformation is typically what we see on climate change,\" Vincent said. The problem of disinformation, on the other hand, \"can be much bigger.\" \"It's an active campaign to lead people to believe something that might be wrong or that might be a partial view of reality for your own benefit,\" he added.

When we talk about \"fake news,\" we're talking about more than just a bit of online clickbait \u2014 but the deliberate spread of fabricated information with the intention to mislead. Once you throw social media in the mix, it can be a recipe for disaster. \"It's often hard to know whether the articles are real or partly fake, but it's very clear that it's engineered,\" Vincent said. \"The sharing happens extremely fast and it goes from zero to 10,000 or 20,000 shares in just a few hours.\" Read more:\u00a0 Why are Google and Facebook financing climate skeptics? Trump downplays temperature rise as he announces his decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement Get your facts straight At a time when the online landscape is dominated by those who shout the loudest, the voices of climate experts like Vincent's are at risk of being drowned out. \"People have come to realize the scale of the issue with the 'fake news' phenomenon,\" he said. \"The reach of this information is very hard to encompass, but fact-checkers are never going to be fast enough to check things in real time.\" Kaup finds fact-checking websites like Climate Feedback helpful to assess\u00a0the credibility of the news she encounters online. But she also uses her own judgement to discern fact from fiction \"I can tell from the content and how it's presented, since I'd assume that 'fake news' is rather unscientific and unserious,\" Kaup said. \"I think my judgment is also based on how trustworthy I consider the source \u2014 how reliable or reputable it is.\" So how can we untangle fact from fiction in our own newsfeeds? Vincent has a few pointers: Mereoni Mili, University of South Pacific Reporter, \"The Island Sun\" (Solomon Islands) Senior Multi-Media Journalist/ Editor, \"Fiji Broadcasting Corporation\" Reporter The Nuku\u2019alofa Times, Executive board member of the Suva-based Pacific Islands News Association (PINA) Senior journalist and Deputy Online Editor, \"The Fiji Times\" Journalist and producer, \"EMTV\" (Papua New Guinea) Steve Bannon, once hailed as the mastermind behind Donald Trump, was forced to step down from his post at Breitbart. Bannon has run afoul not only of Trump, but also of his key backers from the wealthy Mercer family.

{"id": null, "body": "     An organic farmer claims emissions from Volkswagen contributed to climate change and are responsible for damaging his farm. A German court has already expressed doubts as to the case's viability. A court in the western German city of Detmold began hearing a case on Friday against the Volkswagen group brought by an organic farmer who said pollution caused by the carmaker is infringing on his rights. The farmer, who is backed by environmental campaign group Greenpeace, has said that Volkswagen's emissions are contributing to climate change therefore interfering with his fundamental rights to property, health and freedom. He claims extremes caused by climate change such as drier soil and heavier rain is harming his field, cattle and forests. \"Farmers are already being hit harder and faster by climate change than expected,'' he told reporters this week, while alleging that VW as the world's second-biggest automaker has contributed to the damage. \"A corporation with such gigantic CO2 emissions as VW is partly responsible for the damage caused by the climate crisis,\" Roda Verheyen, the farmer's lawyer, was cited as saying by Greenpeace ahead of the proceedings. Both the farmer and Greenpeace accuse VW of knowing about the dangers of climate change for decades, citing research show to VW's board in 1983 showing the consequences of increased CO2 emissions. They want VW to reduce its production of combustion engine vehicles by 25% in the next seven years, and completely phase out combustion engines by 2030. They are also calling for VW to reduce its CO2 emissions by 65% compared to 2018. A spokesman for the court\u00a0told reporters that the case's success was doubtful. After the first hearing, the farmer and his lawyers were instructed to provide further evidence to back up their arguments and allow time for Volkswagen to respond. The presiding judge also said it was unclear whether the plaintiff already suffered climate-related damages or is only expecting them. The next hearing was set for September 9. The carmaker has already said the farmer's allegations are unfounded. He is trying to claim \"individual liability for general consequences of climate change\" and that \"in our view cannot succeed,\" VW said. VW is currently shifting to electric vehicle production , investing over \u20ac35 billion ($36.9 billion) and aiming to be the world's largest electric carmaker by 2035. wmr/rt (AP, AFP) \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "German farmer sues Volkswagen over climate change", "article_name": "german-farmer-sues-volkswagen-over-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/german-farmer-sues-volkswagen-over-climate-change/a-61882834", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 2513, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:02:41.539889"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Ocean waters hit their highest temperature ever last year, and the rate at which they are warming is speeding up, a new study has revealed. Researchers called the new data \"further proof of global warming.\" The world's oceans\u00a0are warmer than ever \u2014 and they are getting warmer faster, according to a new report. In a development\u00a0that provides yet further evidence of global warming, the study, published in the Chinese journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences , found that ocean temperatures in the last decade have been the warmest on record. In addition, the research illustrates\u00a0the influence\u00a0of human-induced\u00a0warming on the Earth's waters and indicates that sea-level rise, ocean acidification and extreme weather\u00a0could get worse\u00a0as the oceans go on\u00a0absorbing excess\u00a0heat. As global warming speeds up, so does the rise in sea levels. While 2004 to 2010 saw oceans rise by about 15 millimeters in total, this value doubled for 2010 to 2016. Tropical regions in the western Pacific are especially affected, threatening many of the coastal areas and low-lying islands with submersion by the end of the century. As ocean and atmospheric temperatures increase, glaciers and ice caps shrink in size. In 2016, the global sea ice extent was 4 million square kilometers (1.54 million square miles) below average. Consequently, more meltwater flows into rivers and oceans, which also causes sea levels to rise. Some ocean regions have already warmed by more than 3 degrees Celsius, upsetting marine ecosystems. Seventy-two percent of demersal fish species in the northeast Atlantic Ocean have so far been affected, with warming limiting their abundance and spread. Species that live in tropical ocean waters, like the clownfish, are also experiencing habitat-related population decreases. Warming and acidifying waters affect Nemo's navigation senses, and also threaten his home - coral reefs, one of the most sensitive marine ecosystems. A water temperature increase of as much as 3 degrees Celsius can cause the death of corals and the marine animal species that live in them. Northern parts of Great Barrier Reef have seen coral mortality rates of 50 percent. With increased ocean heat, extremely strong tropical storms are set to occur much more frequently. One of these massive storms was Hurricane Matthew, which hit Haiti in October 2016. The Haitian government put the official death toll at 546, and the hurricane also caused $15 billion (13.8 billion euros) in economic losses on the island nation and in the US, Cuba and the Bahamas. There is a strong correlation between atmospheric wind patterns and ocean temperatures, meaning warming waters may also cause the jet stream to get stronger. This could affect airplane travel due to intensified head- and tailwinds. On the upside, this means that some flights may be much faster. On the downside, other flights may take longer and could experience more turbulence. Author: Jessie-May Franken 'Really dire news' \"The pace of warming has increased about 500%\u00a0since the late 1980s,\" John Abraham, one of the researchers behind the study, told NBC News. Abraham, who is\u00a0a professor of thermal sciences at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, was not surprised by the results of the study. \"The findings, to be honest, were not unexpected. Warming is continuing, it has accelerated, and it is unabated. Unless we do something significant and quickly, it's really dire news.\" Read more:\u00a0 Opinion: We have to talk about the climate Ocean warming is increasing at an alarming rate, according to the report. In\u00a0the period between 1987 and 2019, warming accelerated at almost 4 1/2 times the rate observed in\u00a0the period between 1955 and 1986, the report showed. Abraham and his colleagues found that in 2019\u00a0alone, average ocean temperatures\u00a0were 0.075 degrees Celsius (0.135 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1981-2019 median.

{"id": null, "body": "     At least 7,348 disasters had occurred between 2000 and 2019, affecting 4.2 billion people. Extreme weather, especially extreme heat, has led to worsening wildfires, droughts and heat waves in the past two decades. Climate change has spurred close to a doubling of natural disasters in the last 20 years, and world leaders are failing to prevent Earth from evolving into \"an uninhabitable hell\" for millions, the United Nations warned on Monday. At least 7,348 major disasters had occurred between 2000 and 2019, claiming 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and costing the global economy some $2.97 trillion, the UN\u00a0Office for Disaster Risk Reduction said in a new report entitled: \"The Human Cost\u00a0of\u00a0Disasters\u00a02000-2019.\" According to the Geneva-based agency, the last two decades saw the number of disasters caused by extreme weather nearly double to 6,681, up from 3,656 between 1980 and 1999. \"We are wilfully destructive. That is the only conclusion one can come to, with action on\u00a0climate\u00a0change\u00a0and other major threats waning,\" said Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary-general's special representative for disaster risk deduction.

Other major recorded disasters included\u00a0earthquakes and tsunamis. The natural disasters also caused almost $3 trillion (\u20ac2.5 trillion) in global economic losses \u2014 almost twice the amount in the preceding two decades. The UN body blamed leaders for not only\u00a0 insufficient action \u00a0in slowing down climate change but also for failing to combat the global coronavirus pandemic\u00a0which has killed over 1 million people and infected over 37 million in the past nine months. \"COVID-19 is but the latest proof that political and business leaders are yet to tune into the world around them,\"\u00a0Mizutori said in a statement. Despite warnings from experts and UN agencies, \"almost all nations\" have not done enough to prevent death and illness caused by the pandemic.

According to the data, Asia has suffered the highest number\u00a0of\u00a0disasters\u00a0in the past 20 years with 3,068 disasters, followed by the Americas with 1,756 and Africa with 1,192.

Shortly before\u00a0climate change talks kicked off in Bonn, the United Nations warned that the latest global warming projections point to a \u00a0 3.2 degree Celsius (5.8 degree Fahrenheit) increase by 2100 \u2014\u00a0far above the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius\u00a0or preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius. As countries determine the world's climate future at the COP23 talks, the question remains: What would a warmer world actually look like? Global warming is just that \u2014 global. But the impacts will vary from place to place. DW takes a look at what 3 degrees would mean for five very different cities.\u00a0\u00a0 New Orleans, United States:\u00a0Storms and flooding Recovering from Katrina has meant not just dealing with the hurricane's aftermath, but also preparing for the next one In the event of a 3 degree\u00a0rise in the global temperature, New Orleans' future looks uncertain. The relationship between climate change and storms is only just beginning to be understood,\u00a0but rising sea levels and warmer sea surface temperatures mean\u00a0New Orleans is likely to experience more Hurricane Katrina-like weather events by the time the century is out.\u00a02017's unusually hyperactive hurricane season may be a worrying harbinger of things to come. Bridget Tydor is a Senior City Planner at the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans (SWBNO) and a member of the ICLEI US People's Delegation to COP23. She told DW\u00a0the city is working hard to maintain levees and be ready to evacuate huge numbers of people. \"As we've seen and learned, defense or mitigation of disasters is not the only piece of the puzzle,\" she says. \"We also have to adapt and have more sustainable buildings and infrastructure to withstand more intense rain events, or even hurricanes.\" Paris, France:\u00a0Heat waves and pollution Heat waves and smog combine to choke French capital A 3-degree temperature rise would make heat waves\u00a0far more common\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including the birthplace of the\u00a0Paris Agreement. Recent analysis by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) suggests summer temperatures over 40-degrees Celsius could be the norm across Europe by 2050.\u00a0 But big cities like Paris also have to contend with air pollution, which is exacerbated by prolonged hot spells \u2014\u00a0and vice versa. A 2017 study found a combination of heat waves and particle pollution exacerbate one another, posing a significant risk to human health. We don't even have to wait for\u00a0the end of the century to see the impact extreme hot weather can have in urban hubs. France was hit especially hard by the 2003 European heat wave, with Paris recording an excess death rate of 141 percent. More recently,\u00a0 this year's \"Lucifer\" heat wave made headlines across southern Europe. Paris is already planning for a\u00a0much warmer future, starting with\u00a0 a ban on diesel vehicles \u00a0in the city center by 2030. Cape Town, South Africa: Drought Cape Town is an attractive location to move to, but will it stay that way as water runs out? As temperatures rise, so too does the risk of drought \u2014\u00a0not only in naturally arid regions, but also those that\u00a0rely on seasonal rainfall. Cape Town is currently in the midst of its\u00a0 worst drought in 100 years. \u00a0Johannes Van Der Merwe is Cape Town's mayoral committee for finance member at COP23. He told DW\u00a0the city is responding to the\u00a0current crisis by building more aquifers and desalination plants, as well as restricting water use , but water scarcity\u00a0is something it will need to adapt to in the long term. \"When I left Cape Town about a week ago, the dam levels were at 38 percent,\" he said, \"We often talk about [this being] the 'new normal.'\" The city's growing population will only make things more difficult. The Cape Town Municipality is currently home to 3.7 million people, but the population is growing 3 percent per year. \"You can be a well-governed and safe city, but if there is no water then you have a problem,\"\u00a0Van Der Merwe says. Dhaka, Bangladesh: Rising sea levels Dhaka is no stranger to flooding, but global warming is putting the city under increasing pressure With a population of 14.4 million,\u00a0Dhaka is the fourth most densely populated city in the world. And it's also one of the most vulnerable to \u00a0rising sea levels. A global mean temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius would cause the oceans to rise by \u00a0 2 to 4 meters within the next three centuries.\u00a0But a 2013 analysis , shows high tides in Bangladesh are rising at least 10 times faster than the world average,\u00a0implying\u00a0a\u00a04-meter rise\u00a0by 2100. That would drive\u00a0at least 15 million people from low-lying rural areas into cities like Dhaka. Muthukumara S. Mani,\u00a0an\u00a0economist at World Bank's South Asia sustainable development department,\u00a0has identified\u00a0areas that will become climate change \"hotspots\"\u00a0over the coming decades. \"Definitely Dhaka is very vulnerable to climate change and needs to be prepared,\" he told DW.\u00a0\"What happens in Dhaka will also depend a great deal on what happens elsewhere in Bangladesh. If things start going down [hill] then obviously people are going to start migrating to Dhaka and that's going to worsen the situation.\" Dhaka itself is barely 4 meters above sea level, and\u00a0high poverty rates mean it\u00a0has limited capacity to adapt to climate change. \"It is difficult to plan ahead given the limited resources the government has right now,\" Mani says.\u00a0 Norilsk, Russia:\u00a0Melting permafrost Norilsk is under threat as the ground beneath the city melts away Melting permafrost is an often-overlooked symptom of climate change, but its impacts are already being felt \u00a0in some of the world's more northerly cities. A 2016 study \u00a0revealed that cities in Siberia built on top of permafrost \u2014\u00a0soil or sediment which is frozen for more than 2 consecutive years \u2014\u00a0are in danger of literally collapsing due to global warming. Norilsk in Russia, the world's northernmost city with a population over 100,000,\u00a0is situated in a continuous permafrost zone. Studies have shown that Arctic Russia is warming faster than the rest of the world by as much as 2.5 degrees. At that current rate, the overall bearing capacity of buildings in Norilsk may be reduced by as much as 75 to\u00a095 percent by the 2040s. Residents are already reporting a sudden increase in damaged or cracked buildings as the ground beneath them gradually thaws. Some 10,500 firefighters were called to tackle forest fires in California in 2015. They were unable to prevent 1,400 homes from destruction. The blaze was fueled by hot and dry weather - as a result of climate change. The polar bear has become a symbol of climate change, as its habitat is threatened by global warming. The Arctic predator hunts from ice sheets that are fast disappearing. As the ice retreats, they are unable to stalk their prey, and risk starvation. By 2050, scientists warn that the Arctic could be ice-free in summer. Just visible from the air is a little wood hut on the island of Spitzbergen in Norway. It is home to the Arctic research base where French and German scientists are studying climatic and atmospheric changes in the polar region, including the damage done to permafrost and glacier systems. A goat watches a mountain expedition on the Swiss Aletsch Glacier, a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was around a kilometer longer in 1860 than it is today. Due to global warming, the glacier is shrinking by up to 50 meters per year. With the rate of retreat increasing, scientists fear Europe's biggest glacier could disappear altogether. \u2026 the landscape looks peaceful, bathed in a mystical light. But the actual situation is far more unsettling. This aerial view shows Central Luzon in the Philippines, completely flooded after it was hit by a typhoon and heavy rain. People were drowned or buried under landslides, and half a million were forced to flee their homes. The country is hit by 20 typhoons each year. \u2026 escape is all that's left. The World Bank warns that if global warming continues unimpeded, another 100 million people will be under threat. Poor people in parts of Africa and South Asia are at particular risk. Drought and flooding threaten crops - leading to hunger, disease and high food prices. Climate change often hits children the hardest, through no fault of their own. Studies have found that economic problems exacerbated by drought can have profound social impacts, such as in an increase in child marriages, for example. Families may marry off their underage daughters earlier to have fewer mouths they have to feed. Elephants produce huge quantities of manure. At Munich's Hellabrunn Zoo in Germany, one local utility is turning their waste into electric power. Around 2,000 tons of biowaste provides enough power for a hundred homes. Could this be a model for an African school? In any case, climate change is forcing new ways of thinking in the search for green energy. The Rhine River is Europe's busiest waterway for shipping - but climate change is affecting business. Ongoing drought means shipping firms would be forced to use shorter vessels that can navigate shallower waters. If ships aren't able to set off, more goods have to be transported by road - which is more expensive. Healthy coral reefs are like a blooming garden. But global warming is bleaching the life out of them. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae, which are vital to their health. But as the water heats up, they expel the algae. If warmer water temperatures persist, a lack of nutrients calcifies the corals, which makes their color fade and causes the organisms to die. Global warming also has its benefits. In recent years, wine is being produced on Germany's northernmost island, Sylt. Ever more vineyards are being established at higher altitudes and further north - even Scandinavia now has some. Global warming also means earlier harvests and sweeter grapes. Author: Karin J\u00e4ger / rr, ng Developing countries like Bangladesh bear the brunt of climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     Have wildfires increased globally over recent years? And if so, is global warming to blame? Research has illuminated this, along with what wildfires do to us and our environment, and which areas are most vulnerable. Are wildfires increasing around the world? Unusually large wildfires ravaged Alaska and Indonesia in 2015. The following year, Canada , California and Spain were devastated by uncontrolled flames. In 2017, massive fires devastated regions of Chile - and\u00a0now, a deadly blaze in Portugal has claimed dozens of lives. So, have wildfires actually increased globally, or does it just seem that way because we're tuned in more to bad news and social media? Science suggests that over the past few decades, the number of wildfires has indeed increased, especially in the western United States. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), every state in the western US has experienced an increase in the average annual number of large wildfires over past decades. Extensive studies have found that large forest fires in the western US have been occurring nearly five times more often since the 1970s and 80s. Such fires are burning more than six times the land area as before, and lasting almost five times longer. A wildfire has hit southern France in 2016 forced more than a thousand people to flee their homes What's more, wildfire season - meaning seasons with higher wildfire potential - has universally become longer over the past 40 years. This trend is something Jason Funk, senior climate scientist with UCS, is very worried about. \"2015 was a record-breaking year in the US, with more than 10 million acres burned,\" he told DW in an interview. \"That's about 4 million hectares, or an area of the size of the Netherlands or Switzerland.\" \"It's a scale we haven't seen in recent history and it's very concerning.\" According to Funk, not only US forests are endangered by increasing wildfires - the trend has been that wildfires are burning more area around the world. \"In recent years, there have been big fires in Siberia and various other places around the world where we typically don't see large-scale wildfires,\" he said. Projections by the UCS suggest that wildfires could get four, five and even six times as bad as they currently are within this century. Portugal was on high alert after a wave of wildfires swept the country in 2016, with around 350 isolated fires What is the main reason wildfires are increasing? Funk has been researching the impact of climate change on landscapes in the US, and says there is very well documented scientific evidence that climate change has been increasing the length of the fire season, the size of the area burned each year and the number of wildfires. Wildfires are typically either started accidentally by humans - such as a burning cigarette carelessly tossed out of a window - or by natural causes like lightning. In televised comments, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa has described raging forest fires in central Portugal as \"the greatest tragedy of human lives that we've witnessed in our country in years.\" He was headed to the site on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday night, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa visited the site and expressed his condolences for the dozens of fire victims. The head of Portugal\u2019s national judicial police said that a lightning strike on Saturday appeared to be the most probable cause of the blaze in the central Pedrogao Grande area. Investigators found a tree that was hit during a \"dry thunderstorm.\" Such storms are frequent when falling water evaporates before reaching the ground because of high temperatures. The Portuguese government has sent two army battalions to help the emergency services in Pedrogao Grande, which is located almost 200 kilometers (124 miles) northeast of the capital, Lisbon. Thousands of firefighters and more than 200 fire engines are busy tackling the flames. As of Monday morning, the fire was still highly active, with thousands battling it on four separate fronts. The European Union, along with several member states, has come forward to provide assistance. France, Spain and Italy were to send more water-dropping planes Monday as part of the cooperation program. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also spoke to the Portuguese Prime Minister Antonia Costa and offered Germany's assistance. Pope Francis led thousands of people in a moment of silent prayer held for the victims of fire in Portugal. He referred to it as the \"devastating fire\" at the end of his Sunday prayer, delivered from his studio window overlooking St. Peter's Square. A woman protects herself from the smoke produced by a forest fire in Pampilhosa da Serra, Portugal. The country was hit by a series of such fires last year which devastated more than 1,000 square kilometers. Fires on the tourist island of Madeira in August killed three people. Over the whole year of 2016, around 40 homes were destroyed and 5,400 hectares (13, 344 acres) of land burned out.  Author: Aasim Saleem These \"ignition events\" don't have a major effect on the scale of the fire, says Funk. But what does affect scale are prevailing climate conditions. And these have become warmer and drier - due to climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions, via the greenhouse effect, are causing the global temperature to increase and the climate to change. This enhances the likelihood of wildfires. Why? Because warmer temperatures increase evaporation, which means the atmosphere draws more moisture from soils, making the land drier. A warmer climate also leads to earlier snowmelt, which causes soils to be drier for longer. And dry soils become more susceptible to fire. \"The areas where wildfires are taking place are always areas that [have become] drier and hotter, and where spring has come earlier,\" said Funk. Drier conditions and higher temperatures increase not only the likelihood of a wildfire to occur, but also the duration and the severity of the wildfire. Climate change has increased the length of the fire season, the size of the area burned and the number of wildfires That means when wildfires break out, they expand faster and burn more area as they move in unpredictable ways. \"They really take off and get out of control more frequently than in the past,\" said Funk. What else is increasing wildfires? A less direct climate-driven effect is pest outbreaks that have killed a lot of trees. Pests make forests more susceptible to wildfire, according to Funk. \"We know that these pest outbreaks have been caused by climate change, because there hasn't been anything like that in the past 500 years, perhaps even 1,000 years,\" he said. Insects are responding to warmer conditions, Funk explained, taking advantage of the longer summer season which grants them longer breeding circles and faster reproduction. \"We can link those effects to the warmer temperatures that we've seen in the places where wildfires have been taking place.\" While human activities such as logging and mining are known to influence the likelihood of wildfires as well, many of the areas that have seen recent increases in wildfires are relatively unaffected by human land use. This suggests that climate change is a major factor driving the increase in fires, according to UCS. Fires can be beneficial for ecosystems - but changes in climatic conditions are allowing them to burn out of control What threats do these wildfires pose? Forest fires aren't necessarily bad. In fact, fire is a natural and beneficial part of many forest ecosystems, and we need to allow some fires to burn, as they are necessary for the ecosystems to stay healthy. Over the decades, undergrowth builds up on the forest floor - so when a fire burns through, that provides space for larger, more mature trees that are more fire-resistant. But the unnatural increase in wildfires is causing entire forests to burn down uncontrollably. This is bad for the environment - and for us. Wildfires pose risks to human life, property and infrastructure - recent wildfires have already caused significant human health impacts across southeast Asia, says Funk. Forest fires directly kill plants and animals, also causing a loss of habitat. Humid boreal forest faces greater threats from wildfires But the biggest problem is that the scale of these fires has increased to the degree that they themselves have become significant contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. After all, trees absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere - so the more trees that burn down, the harder it is to combat climate change in the future. And this is dangerous, Funk said. \"It creates a feedback loop: the fires create more emissions, which in turn contribute to more global warming, which will then cause more fires,\" Funk said. \"Fires are not the enemy - they are an effect of an underlying process, so we need to address the problem rather than the symptoms of that problem.\" What areas are most affected by wildfire? According to US federal research, humid, forested areas are most likely to face greater threats from wildfires, as conditions there grow drier and hotter due to global warming. Forests increasingly affected by fire and climate change, and which are thus the most vulnerable, are in the boreal region. This stretches across the northern hemisphere through Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia and Russia. Wildfire raged through the Canadian town of Fort McMurray in 2016, forcing the evacuation of some 90,000 people Boreal forest comprises almost a third of forested land in the world, and plays an important role in absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. Studies show that especially the Russian and Canadian boreal forests are increasingly threatened by wildfire, as temperatures are rising faster in these northern regions than in other areas of the planet. Funk warns that since rising temperatures are transforming many landscapes, \"we're likely to see more wildfires in more places than just the boreal forest in the future.\" People fled from at least 400 homes as authorities declared a state of emergency in two districts. The local mayor said the danger wasn't over yet on Thursday. Up to 15 helicopters helped battle the flames by dumping water from above. Crews said they were planning on letting the fire burn itself out. A decorated special veteran, piloting one of the firefighting helicopters, died in a crash on Tuesday. His formerly secret role in defense missions in Afghanistan were only revealed after his death. Prime Minister Bill English said he thought the fires seemed \"suspicious.\" Local media attributed the first fire to an electrical fault. The cause of the second fire, which seemed to begin in a carpark, was unknown on Thursday. Fires of this intensity are rare for New Zealand. Regular rain usually keeps fires at bay, unlike their Australian neighbors. Author: Alistair Walsh New regional and global studies link heatwaves, drought and insect outbreaks with a surge in wildfires, and the Alps are unlikely to be spared.

{"id": null, "body": "     India will likely face irreversible impacts of climate change, with increasing heat waves, droughts and erratic rainfall events in the coming years if no mitigation measures are put in place, experts warn. Heat waves have become more common and severe in India India will suffer more frequent and intense heat waves, extreme rainfall events and erratic monsoons, as well as more cyclonic activity, among other weather-related calamities, in the coming decades, a report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0 The report, Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis , is the first part of IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) \u2014 its latest evaluation of the state of Earth's climate and the impact on the planet and various life forms. \"Heat extremes have increased while cold extremes have decreased, and these trends will continue over the coming decades,\" the report said regarding the Indian subcontinent. Experts say India, and South Asia in general, is particularly vulnerable to climate change. \"The threat of climate change is real \u2014 dangers are imminent and the future is catastrophic. This message from the IPCC report confirms what we already know and can see in the world around us,\" said Sunita Narain, an environmentalist and director of the Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment. \"From wildfires because of extreme heat and moisture loss to devastating floods because of extreme rain events, and tropical cyclones because of the changing temperatures between the sea and land surface, it should worry us,\" Narain said. Climate change has already hit India hard, causing huge economic and social losses in recent years.\u00a0 This year, for instance, India has witnessed severe floods, cloudbursts and landslides in several states across the country, causing death and destruction. \"This year's monsoon was more erratic with the rainfall intensity increasing in short durations causing damage to property and human life,\" Ravi Shankar Najundiah, director of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, told DW. Experts say heavy rain events have increased threefold since 1950, but total precipitation has declined and at least a billion people in the South Asian country currently face severe water scarcity for at least one month annually. And heat waves have become more common and severe, with many cities reporting temperatures above 48 degrees Celsius (118.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in 2020. In a study published by The Lancet Planetary Health journal last month, researchers concluded that nearly 740,000 excess deaths in India annually could be attributed to abnormal hot and cold temperatures related to climate change. Meanwhile, weather-related calamities and crises are slowing the pace of poverty reduction and increasing inequality nationwide. Furthermore, should the average global temperature rise by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 F), the resulting decline in agricultural productivity, rise in sea levels and negative health outcomes are projected to cost India about 3% of its GDP, according to a report published last month by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) think tank. \"Given that India is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, we must recognize that even geographically faraway climatic changes can have consequences for our monsoons and intensity of extreme events,\" Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said in a statement. \"Our focus should be on building climate-resilient physical and digital infrastructure along with inculcating social and behavioural changes in citizens and communities.\" Experts say Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government should act swiftly and put in place necessary measures to tackle climate-related challenges. Chandra Bhushan, CEO of International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology, said the situation would only worsen if the Indian government did not act faster and decisively. \"This is a warning for our economy and human life. Things that were predicted to happen far later in the future are now expected to happen much sooner, including intense heat waves, monsoon disruptions, cloud bursts and extreme rain,\" Bhushan told DW. Sumaira Abdulali, environmentalist and founder of the NGO Awaaz Foundation, has a similar view. \"In theory, the problems of climate change are unmistakable and well acknowledged, but in practice, in the face of development imperatives , we have not learned any lessons at all despite all types of climate-related catastrophic events,\" the expert told DW. \"We seem clearly headed towards further climate disaster.\" A wildfire that burned through at least 7,780 hectares (30 square miles) in about a week and devastated forests in southern Spain was brought under control thanks to steady rains. The downpour helped the firefighters, who were backed by some 50 aircrafts. The blaze was one of the most difficult to combat in recent times in Spain. Some 2,600 people were forced to flee their homes. Unprecedented flooding \u2014 caused by two months' worth of rainfall in two days \u2014 has resulted in devastating damage in central Europe, leaving at least 226 people dead in Germany and Belgium. Narrow valley streams swelled into raging floods in the space of hours, wiping out centuries-old communities. Rebuilding the ruined homes, businesses and infrastructure is expected to cost billions of euros. While half of Europe is drowning, elsewhere areas are going up in flames: Large fires raged, particularly in Greece, Italy and Turkey. They have caused unforeseeable monetary damage, while thousands of people in Europe have lost their homes and their belongings. In addition to deadly wildfires, Italy also battled record heat temperatures, with the Italian Health Ministry issuing the maximum possible heat warning level for many cities. On the island of Sicily, 48.8 degrees Celsius (almost 120 degrees Fahrenheit) was measured on August 11 \u2014 a new European heat record. The heat could make existing fires worse, or lead to new ones. Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire continues smoldering in California. It's California's largest fire on record, and among the most destructive in the state's history \u2014 it wiped the town of Greenville off the map. Although it's about 60% contained, the fire continues to burn two months in. Meanwhile, hot and dry conditions continue in the region, spreading fears of more fire. Earlier this summer, record floods also hit parts of India and central China, overwhelming dams and drains and flooding streets. The downpours have been particularly heavy, even for the rainy season. Scientists have predicted that climate change will lead to more frequent and intense rainfall \u2014 warmer air holds more water, creating more rain. As nations flood in northern Europe, Mediterranean countries like Greece were in the grip of several heat waves. In the first week of July, temperatures soared to 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit). Tourism hot spots like the Acropolis were forced to shut during the day, while the extreme heat also sparked forest fires outside Thessaloniki, which helicopters tried to douse. \"It is an unprecedented reality in Sardinia\u2019s history,\" said Sardinia's Governor Christian Salinas of the ongoing wildfires that have scorched the historic central western area of Montiferru. \"So far, 20,000 hectares of forest that represent centuries of environmental history of our island have gone up in ashes.\" Around 1,500 people were evacuated from the island by the end of July. Intense heat is becoming more common, as seen in late June in the US states of Washington and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Scorching temperatures under a \"heat dome,\" hot air trapped for days by high pressure fronts, caused hundreds of heat-related deaths. The village of Lytton recorded a high of 49.6 Celsius (121 Fahrenheit) \u2014 and burned to the ground the next day. Heat and drought are fueling one of the most intense wildfire seasons in the West Coast and Pacific Northwest regions. Oregon's Bootleg Fire, which burned an area the size of Los Angeles in just two weeks, was so big it created its own weather and sent smoke all the way to New York City. A recent study said the weather conditions would have been \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. To the south, central Brazil is suffering its worst drought 100 years, increasing the risk of fires and further deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Researchers recently reported that a large swath of the southeastern Amazon has flipped from absorbing to emitting planet-warming CO2 emissions, pushing the rainforest closer to a \"tipping point.\" After years of unrelenting drought, more than 1.14 million people in Madagascar are food-insecure, with some now forced to eat raw cactus, wild leaves and roots, and locusts in famine-like conditions. With the absence of natural disaster, crop failure or political conflict, the dire situation in the African nation is said to be first famine in modern history caused solely by climate change. The number of people fleeing conflict and natural disasters hit a 10-year high in 2020, with a record 55 million people relocating within their own country. That's in addition to some 26 million people who fled across borders. A joint report released by refugee monitors in May found that three-quarters of the internally displaced were victims of extreme weather \u2014 and that number is likely to grow.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change exacerbates inequalities, not only in poor, developing countries, but also in industrialized, wealthy ones. The poor should be given special importance when planning, experts say. As drought, flooding and fires lay claim to headlines and landscapes across the world, and as countries and cities grapple with the cost of it all, the highest price is already being paid \u2014 by those who are\u00a0poor or marginalized. Such are the findings of a\u00a0recent study by\u00a0researchers\u00a0 Noah S. Diffenbaugh\u00a0and\u00a0Marshall Burke . It\u00a0reveals that the economic gap between rich and poor countries would have been smaller without the climate crisis. \"India's per capita GDP [gross domestic product] is approximately 30% lower than it would have been without warming,\" Noah Diffenbaugh, co-author of the study,\u00a0told DW, adding that Brazil's\u00a0per capita GDP has taken a\u00a025% hit as a result of climate change.\u00a0 Eight of the ten countries most affected by extreme weather events \u00a0\u2014 such as hurricanes and monsoon rains \u2014 between 1998 and 2017, were developing nations with low or lower-middle income, the Global Climate Risk Index of the NGO Germanwatch shows. \"Regions like Southeast Asia are very vulnerable, not only because they are often hit, but because they lack resources to deal with the impact,\" David Eckstein, co-author of the Index, told DW. Although natural disasters are not new, climate change increases their frequency and intensity, making it harder for\u00a0those affected to cope with the impacts. \"Often, these countries are in the process of rebuilding when they're struck again by an event,\" Eckstein said. Oxfam International says the two cyclones that hit Mozambique in rapid succession earlier this year left 2.6 million people in need of\u00a0food, shelter and clean water. Thousands have had to look for a new place to live. According to the Switzerland-based\u00a0 Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre \u00a0they were among seven million \u2014\u00a0out of a total 10.8 million people internally displaced between January and June this year \u2014 forced to leave their homes because of weather-related disasters and earthquakes.\u00a0 Poverty in unexpected places But even people who do not currently live in extreme poverty are\u00a0at risk of becoming poor, Harjeet Singh, climate policy lead with the NGO ActionAid International, told DW. He recently visited the Sundarbans, where land has been swallowed by rising sea levels. \"People there had resources, but their lives have been completely devastated by climate change impacts,\" he said. \"They've fallen into the poverty trap.\" Millions were affected by the cyclones that hit Mozambique in rapid succession earlier this year He witnessed a similar situation in Senegal's Saloum Delta,\u00a0where sea level rise is making it hard for communities to\u00a0farm or fish. That's how people \"become ultra poor and migrate without any resources, and become unskilled labor in urban areas,\" he explained. Economic disparities due to climate change aren't unique to poorer countries. \u00a0 A 2017 study \u00a0published in the peer-reviewed journal, Science, says\u00a0 higher temperatures in US states such as Arizona will lead to a more intense use of cooling systems, which in turn implies greater energy use and\u00a0higher costs for consumers.\u00a0\u00a0 Some northern states, however, could benefit through\u00a0reduced heating use, among other factors.\u00a0In Maine, for instance, the most northeasterly US state, the gross county product could increase by up to to 10%, while in Arizona it could fall by as much as\u00a020%, the study shows. In the Spanish capital, Madrid, over 20% of households are at risk of energy poverty \u2014\u00a0the lack of capacity to keep homes warm in winter and cool in summer, a study requested by regional authorities shows . \"People with fewer resources can't afford to pay for heating or air conditioning and often live in much older buildings without proper insulation,\" Cristina Linares, researcher at Spain's National School of Public Health, told DW. That makes extreme temperatures particularly threatening. Spain has been grappling with fires and droughts in recent years Women stand to be hard hit Research Linares is involved in\u00a0 suggests\u00a0the\u00a0risk to\u00a0women-led households is between\u00a035 and 120% higher than the area average. Elderly women living alone and single mothers are particularly vulnerable. The analysis attributes this to the fact that the highest average pension among women in Madrid is below the lowest average pension for men, and that in 50% of cases, the families of single mothers\u00a0live below the poverty threshold. Women have previously been cited as more likely to be feel the impacts \u00a0of\u00a0climate change, and they frequently lack the resources to\u00a0cope with them. \"When harvests fail, struggling families are often forced to pull out their kids out of school and it's always the girls who get pull out first,\"\u00a0Kiri\u00a0Hanks, policy adviser with Oxfam International, told DW.\u00a0 Planning and more planning Attempts to close the inequality gap without proper planning could cause more harm than good. Providing everyone in Spain with heating and cooling systems, for example, would help people deal with extreme temperatures, but \"that would exacerbate the problem at its source due to greater energy consumption,\" Linares said. Eckstein from Germanwatch says initiatives to help countries recover are important, \"but what is also necessary is for these countries to prepare in advance.\" Bangladesh, he says, has improved its position in the Climate Risk Index because it deals with climate change impacts better than other countries.\u00a0Among other measures, it has built seawalls to prevent flooding and introduced\u00a0early warning systems to evacuate people on time. Social protection mechanisms to help people relocate and learn new skills also matter. \"If relocation needs to happen, it has to happen in a much more planned manner,\" Singh said. But since the affected\u00a0countries often lack the economic and technical capacity to go this far, international support plays a decisive role, he added. Singh agrees that preventive planning is the key to reducing the inequality gap intensified by climate change. \"Current players are leading us to a 3 degrees [Celsius] warmer world,\" he said. \"We really hope that we don't reach that point, but our planning has to be with that thinking.\" In some parts of the world access to freshwater is taken for granted, but it's actually a luxury. Freshwater only makes up 2.5% of the world's total volume, and more than half of that is ice. Agriculture uses 70% of what's actually usable. By 2050, two-thirds of the world's population is expected to suffer from water scarcity, which will affect all aspects of people's lives. Competition for land is growing across the globe. As the world's population continues to grow, the available land doesn't and is increasingly degrading. Extreme weather events due to climate change add to the equation. Countries with a large population or scarce land areas for agriculture, such as China and Saudi Arabia, are already seeking land in Africa. Land is seen as the new gold. And speaking of oil, fossil fuels should surely have a place at the table of the world's scarce resources if anything because they can't be replenished. Continuing today's rate of consumption will eventually lead to their depletion. This could prove a huge challenge for countries, like Iraq and Libya, which have traditionally had large oil and natural gas reserves. The same goes for coal. Even if countries like Germany are reluctant to move away from this polluting source of energy, the reserves are emptying. In Poland, lignite (or brown coal) reserves from operating mines are expected to run out by 2030. Hard coal might last a little longer, but not much, experts say. Therefore, the country might be forced to break up with coal soon \u2013 even if it hurts. If we think of a desert, sand seems infinite, but its natural production is actually a rather slow process. Sand is a renewable resource, but it's being used at such a fast rate for things like construction that nature doesn't have time to reproduce it. In developing regions like East Africa, where the population is expected to double by roughly 2050, sand could become a scarce resource. Careless behavior with regard to all living beings on this planet is pushing several species to the brink of extinction. Animals are widely seen as resource for humans, and as such pangolins, rhinos, vaquitas or seahorses could be included in the list of scarce natural resources. If they continue to be exploited resources unsustainably, human life will be at risk. It seems like everything is falling apart and as if nothing more can be done to prevent a bleak future. Yet, one thing that's still available is time, a scarce but extremely valuable resource. Some say the climate emergency could still be reversed if action is taken over the next 12 years. And for once, we are allowed to exploit a resource to the fullest. There is no time to lose.

The name of the UNEP's latest report says it all \u2014 and its findings are sobering. With the updated NDCs, greenhouse gas emissions will only see a reduction of 7.5% by 2030. But in order to achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius/2.7 degrees Fahrenheit\u00a0(compared to 1900 levels), greenhouse gases would have to fall by 55%.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, the world must cut its emissions by 28 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) per year by 2030. To limit emissions to 2 C, countries would still have to reduce their climate-damaging emissions by 30%, or 13 GtCO2e. \"To be clear: we have eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts. The clock is ticking loudly,\" Inger Andersen, executive director of the UNEP, wrote in the report. If, however, countries just stick to their own national climate targets, which they are allowed to set individually under the Paris Agreement, the world is on track for a temperature rise of 2.7 C. \"That would result in\u00a0 catastrophic climate change that we would not be able to cope with at all \u2014 that must be avoided at all costs,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, director of the Cologne-based nonprofit research organization New Climate Institute and professor of climate protection at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. The UNEP report expressed disappointment that investments designed to stimulate the economy after the coronavirus pandemic had barely\u00a0taken climate protection into consideration . According to the report, less than one-fifth of recovery packages are likely to contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0 \u00a0 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 5.4% drop in new emissions worldwide. At the same time, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached a new high , according to a report from the World Meteorological Organization, the UN's weather and climate agency.\u00a0\u00a0 Compared to the previous year, the increase was even higher than the average rise over the past decade, the report said. Or, as the UNEP puts it: \"CO2 concentrations are higher than at any time in the last 2 million years.\"\u00a0 Natural greenhouse gas sinks, like the Amazon, can help offset emissions According to the UNEP, the net-zero pledges made by a host of countries, including the United States, Japan, China, as well as the European Union, could make a significant difference.\u00a0 Net zero means that for all of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans, the same amount must be removed from the atmosphere. Artificial and natural greenhouse gas sinks, such as peatlands or forests, can be offset against greenhouse gases emitted. \"If made robust and implemented fully, net-zero targets could shave an extra 0.5 C off global warming, bringing the predicted temperature rise down to 2.2 C,\" the UNEP report says. It is critical, however, of the fact that many countries are not planning to start working toward\u00a0net-zero until after 2030 .\u00a0 Countries need to link long-term net-zero targets to their ongoing NDCs and move forward quickly, UNEP Executive Director Andersen urged in the report's foreword.\u00a0\"This can't happen in five years. Or in three years. This needs to start happening now,\" she said.\u00a0 \u00a0 Even if global warming were stopped at 2 C, Niklas H\u00f6hne of the New Climate Institute said the world would be a changed place. \"We are currently at a temperature increase of 1 C. And we're seeing droughts, forest dying, floods \u2014 like in [Germany's] Ahr Valley \u2014 and fires all over the world. An increase of 2 C means, as a first approximation, twice as many floods, twice as many extreme weather events.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Livestock farming is just one of the ways methane is released into the atmosphere The UNEP report sees another opportunity to close the gap between climate targets and the current reality, through the reduction of methane emissions . Methane not only escapes during the extraction of fossil fuels, but is produced during the decomposition of organic waste,\u00a0in the treatment of wastewater and through\u00a0livestock farming and rice cultivation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Though methane only lingers in the atmosphere for 12 years compared to up to centuries\u00a0for CO2, it is much more potent and therefore significantly more harmful to the climate during its relatively short lifespan. As such, a rapid reduction of methane emissions could limit temperature rise faster in the short term than a drop in CO2, according to the report. Mechanisms such as compensation payments to poorer countries or clearly defined and properly designed carbon markets could also lead to countries taking more ambitious climate protection measures, the UNEP authors wrote.\u00a0\u00a0 \"We are so late to climate action that it is imperative that developed countries, in addition to efforts at home, help developing countries reduce emissions as quickly as possible. The emissions gap is so large that no country can sit back,\" H\u00f6hne said. This year's Emissions Gap Report highlights not only failures but also the enormous potential for more climate action, wrote UNEP's\u00a0Andersen. For example, policies implemented between 2010 and 2021 will lower annual emissions by 11 GtCO2e in 2030 compared to what would have happened without them. Though she said \"we should not despair,\"\u00a0she also called on the world to \"wake up to the imminent peril we face as a species. We need to go firm. We need to go fast. And we need to start doing it now.\" This article has been\u00a0adapted from German As the world grinds to a halt, the sudden shutdown of most industrial activities has dramatically reduced air pollution levels. Satellite images have even revealed a clear drop in global levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gas which is primarily emitted from car engines and commercial manufacturing plants and is responsible for poor air quality in many major cities. Like NO2, carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) have also been slashed in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. When economic activity stalls, so do CO2 emissions \u2014 in fact, the last time this happened was during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In China alone, emissions have fallen by around 25% when the country entered lockdown, according to Carbon Brief. But this change is likely to only be temporary. As everyone retreats to their homes, some animals have been taking advantage of our absence. Reduced road traffic means little critters like hedgehogs emerging from hibernation are less likely to be hit by cars. Meanwhile, other species like ducks may be wondering where all the people have gone and will need to find other sources of food besides breadcrumbs in the park. Conservationists hope the coronavirus outbreak will help curb global wildlife trade, which is responsible for pushing a number of species to the brink of extinction. COVID-19 likely originated in a Wuhan wet market, which sells live produce and is a hub for both legal and illegally trafficked wildlife. A crackdown on trading live wildlife may be one positive thing to come out of the crisis.\u202f\u202f Shortly after Italy entered lockdown, images of crystal clear canals in Venice were shared around the world \u2014 the pristine blue waters are a far cry from their usual muddy appearance. And with cruise ships docked for the time being, our oceans are also experiencing a drop in noise pollution, lowering the stress levels of marine creatures like whales and making for a much more peaceful migration. But it's not all good news. One of the worst environmental side-effects of the coronavirus pandemic is the rapid increase in the use of disposable plastic \u2014 from medical equipment like disposable gloves, to plastic packaging as more people opt for prepackaged foods. Even cafes that remain open no longer accept reusable cups from customers in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. With the coronavirus dominating, the climate crisis has been pushed to the sidelines. But that doesn't make it any less urgent. Experts are warning that important decisions regarding the climate should not be delayed \u2014 even with the UN climate conference postponed until 2021. While emissions have dropped since the pandemic began, we're unlikely to see widespread and long-term change as a result.

It also suggested using the tax to tackle climate change and create better access to health care. \"A wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity and strengthen our democratic freedoms,\" the letter said. \"Instituting a wealth tax is in the interest of our republic.\" Read more: \u00a0 Risk of poverty at new high in Germany: report 'Deliberately' targeting the poor While the letter called for all US presidential candidates to implement a wealth tax in a bid to create bipartisan support, it named several Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas. \"The first specific candidate proposal, introduced by Senator Warren, would provide millions of families with a better shot at the American dream by taxing only 75,000 of the wealthiest families in the country,\" the letter said.

{"id": null, "body": "     A range of technologies \u2014 loosely defined as 'geoengineering' \u2014 are being explored as responses to climate change. Yet their effectiveness, and whether they should be implemented at all, is debated among scientists. Australia's bushfires have brought the devastating\u00a0consequences of a warming\u00a0world into sharp relief. And with modelling pointing to temperature increases of between\u00a0three and four degrees Celcius by 2100 in a business-as-usual scenario, predictions suggest such extreme events are set to become more frequent.\u00a0 What if we could reverse the warming that is fueling drought and causing flooding around the world? That is\u00a0exactly what organizations like the US-based non-profit Foundation for Climate Restoration (F4CR), are proposing. The group wants to restore carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to under 300 parts per million, as was the case in the pre-fossil fuel age. Today, the\u00a0global average measures\u00a0more than 400 parts per million.\u00a0 \"I'm very interested in leaving [behind] a world where our children can survive,\" Pieter Fiekowsky, an MIT-trained physicist who founded F4CR in 2015, told DW. To him, \"that clearly requires getting CO2 back to safe levels.\u201d According to the foundation, achieving that involves \"climate restoration,\"\u00a0that is, making sure we're collectively removing more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere than we produce. The foundation believes around a trillion \u00a0tons of carbon dioxide needs to be extracted. That would\u00a0require large-scale implementation of nature-based or artificial technologies to suck vast quantities of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere to cool the planet \u2014\u00a0 strategies that fall under the loose\u00a0 definition \u00a0of \"geoengineering.\"\u00a0However, which technologies are best suited, and whether to implement them at all, is hotly debated among scientists. Air pollution resulting from emissions poses a serious health threat F4CR have proposed restoring marine habitats that store carbon, such as underwater kelp forests Climate benefits Rob Jackson, an earth systems scientist at Stanford University,\u00a0 believes \u00a0that restoring the climate to what it once was is a better goal than merely stabilizing Earth's temperatures. \"We need a new story, a new narrative around climate change,\" says Jackson, who argues this should involve ambitions that go beyond merely limiting the damage of climate change. \"[Climate restoration] will bring climate benefits. It will save lives by reducing air pollution. It will provide a host of other benefits.\" One solution proposed by F4CR in a\u00a0 last year entails restoring marine habitats that store carbon, such as underwater kelp forests. Another is a form of concrete \u00a0that binds carbon as it's made, which was used \u00a0recently to build a new terminal at San Francisco airport. There are sectors where certain emissions are hard to remove entirely, such as methane \u2014 a\u00a0greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide\u00a0\u2014 in the agricultural sector, says Jackson.\u00a0He recently proposed \u00a0 a technology to remove methane from the air by oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, which although stays around longer has less heat-trapping capacity.\u00a0 Climate scientists have included some geoengineering solutions, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) \u2014 the process of extracting carbon from crops and storing it underground \u2014 in the majority of pathways modelled in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. A form of concrete\u00a0 that binds carbon as it's made was used\u00a0recently to build a new terminal at San Francisco airport \"It is actually not possible to limit global warming to 2 or 1.5 degrees Celsius, without [removal of greenhouse gases],\" Avit Bhowmik, an assistant professor of risk and environmental studies at Sweden's Karlstad University, told DW. \"Just stopping the increase of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses wouldn't be enough \u2014 we have to sequester them.\" No silver bullet Still, Jackson notes some geoengineering proposals, such as releasing large quantities of iron into the ocean to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton\u2014providing food for fish and thereby rebuilding carbon-sequestering fisheries \u2014 are still at the experimental stage. More research is needed both into\u00a0scaling up such ideas\u00a0and into\u00a0the ecological impacts, says Jackson.\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 Building affordable, green housing in a South African township \u00a0 Even technologies like BECCS are still in testing.\u00a0Many experts believe they also distract from the urgency of ceasing greenhouse gas emissions. \"I think these long-term goals [of climate restoration] take away focus from the really important challenge that we have today of bending the emissions curve downward,\" says Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London. There is also concern that geoengineering technologies\u00a0could create a false sense of security that increased emissions could be removed. Rogelj says ecosystems unable to adapt to current warming are not likely to return even if temperatures decrease. \"Climate restoration doesn't mean that the Earth will look the same [as it did before the pre-industrial era],\" Rogelj adds. Can we improve agricultural practices so farmland absorbs rather than emits carbon? Reforestation has been flagged as one way of helping to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere A middle ground? Bhowmik believes it should be possible to achieve a net decline in greenhouse gases without resorting to the most radical geoengineering approaches. The Exponential Roadmap report \u00a0published in 2019, in which Bhowmik led the modelling work, lays out a strategy focused heavily on nature-based solutions. To follow that roadmap, the world would need to halve global greenhouse gas emissions every decade from 2020 onwards, improve agricultural practices so farmland absorbs rather than emits carbon, restore large areas of forest and protect carbon-storing ecosystems like peatlands.

And soon thereafter we will reach the level that was in the preindustrial period,\" Bhowmik believes. Climate restoration got a boost in September 2019 when F4CR joined scientists, venture capitalists and youth activists at a UN Forum aiming to spur investment for a range of nascent technologies to reverse global warming. Even though there's disagreement on what \u2014 if any \u2014 form climate restoration should take, most scientists do agree that it shouldn't be a replacement for mitigating climate change or helping communities around the world cope with the impacts of rising tempertures. That includes F4CR. \"Climate restoration is a critical third pillar,\u201d says Rick Parnell, CEO of the organization. \u201c[It\u2019s] a third leg of the stool, along with mitigation and adaptation.\"\u00a0 This is an updated version of a previous article. Before satellites were first launched into space in the mid-20th century, we knew very little about the dynamics of our climate. Today, numerous satellites collect information which helps us piece together the story of our changing planet. In 1985, they helped discover the hole in the ozone layer, and data from space remains key to tackling global warming. Some satellites monitor signs of climate change, such as melting ice caps, rising sea levels and amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. The Jason-3 satellite (pictured), launched in 2016, can make precise measurements of global sea levels, a key indicator of climate change. The data will give us a stronger understanding of just how our oceans are being affected by increased temperatures. Space technology has paved the way for the development of increasingly sophisticated surveying and monitoring tools which can track everything from deforestation to illegal fishing ships and even oil spills. This way, researchers know exactly when and where environmental \u2014 and legal \u2014 action needs to be taken. Satellites play a vital role in tracking natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires and floods. As well as providing an early warning for those on the ground, they also help authorities track the intensity of the event and understand the scale of the devastation. Monitoring storm systems helps generate better climate models to predict future disasters. Growing plants in space has already taught us valuable lessons which can be applied to sustainable agriculture on Earth. Astronauts on the International Space Station have discovered they can use less water to grow vegetables, and China recently made history by germinating a cotton seed on the far side of the moon. As our planet warms, this knowledge could be vital for farmers. Unfortunately, space technology has also had a negative impact on the environment. Every time a rocket is launched it produces a plume of exhaust smoke filled with bits of soot and a chemical called alumina, which can build up in the stratosphere and deplete the ozone. Space agencies are looking to lessen their use of \"ozone-depleting substances\" and are researching more eco-friendly fuels. There are currently more than 20,000 trackable pieces of space junk in orbit around Earth, including everything from old rockets to bolts and screws. They're not technically part of Earth's ecosphere, but if we're not careful the junk may become so dense that satellites won't be able to function properly and provide us with the data we so desperately need.

{"id": null, "body": "     Germany's Alps are already contending with climate change and locals are feeling the effects. Jennifer Collins reports from the country's highest peak on disappearing glaciers, less snowfall and increased landslides. It's unseasonably warm on Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze. Thirty years ago, September would have brought freezing temperatures and the first snow flurries. Today, tourists explore the bare, snowless, moon-like rockscape in T-shirts and shorts.\u00a0 A lot has changed on the mountain in those 30 years, said\u00a0Toni Zwinger, who grew up on the Zugspitze in the southern German state of Bavaria. The 33-year-old's family has been running the M\u00fcnchner Haus \u2014 an inn 2,959 meters (9,700 feet) up, just near the summit \u2014 since 1925, back when only intrepid climbers could reach it. Read more: \u00a0 Climate change, mass tourism threaten Alps As a boy, Zwinger played around the glaciers and took trips to the Austrian side of the mountain for plates of French fries. He knew almost everyone then but now there are too many people on the summit \u2014 a steady stream of tourists and workers, he said, still wearing a blue denim apron, having just finished up after another busy day. The glaciers of his childhood have all but disappeared too. The Northern Schneeferner has shrunk to a mere 25 percent of its 1950 volume. On the Southern Schneeferner, it's even worse as\u00a0only 6 percent is left. \"This year was the hottest they've measured during the past 25 years,\" Zwinger told DW, sitting in a room in the inn decorated with wooden panels and beams. \"You can see it with the glacier. It's getting smaller.\" And in the evenings, he hears the boulders outside shifting. That's something scientists who have been researching climate change on the Zugspitze and surrounding mountains have also observed. Toni Zwinger's family operates an inn near the summit of Germany's highest mountain. He's noticed the effects of climate change there over the last 30 years As temperatures increase, the permafrost \u2014 a layer of sediment, rock or soil that remains frozen for more than two consecutive years and that stabilizes the mountain rock \u2014 is retreating too. That and increased rainfall, have caused the rocks to lose their stability, leading to more than a thousand rockfalls in the Alps in the past year, said\u00a0Michael Krautblatter, a professor of landslide research at Munich's Technical University (TUM). \"People come here and expect me to tell them something about the future,\" said Krautblatter from a hotel-turned-research station on the side of the Zugspitze. \"You just go in and you see how the permafrost changed over the last 20 years. Climate change is already here.\" The view from above For over a decade, Krautblatter has been visiting the Schneefernerhaus station to study changes to the\u00a0permafrost of the German Alps in which the Zugspitze sits. He and a small team of scientists load equipment onto a tiny private cable car for a few days' hands-on research in the station that will involve them donning climbing gear and scaling part of the mountain face to install measuring equipment. Part of the job involves placing electrodes inside the rock to measure electrical conductivity \u2014 where it's no longer frozen, the electrical conductivity is good, he explained. This allows the researchers to see how the \"frozen bit of the rock\" changes over time. Krautblatter refers to the equipment pictured as the 'workhorse' the team uses to measure permafrost on the Zugspitze The Zugspitze has seen warming of around 1 degree Celsius since 1985, according to the researcher. Where temperatures in January once hit minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4\u00a0degrees Fahrenheit), they now get down to lows of minus 10 or minus 5 Celsius. \"This is not cool enough that it [the permafrost] would sustain over the summer,\" Krautblatter explains. In 10 to 15 years, there will be no permafrost left, he predicts. One strand of his research looks at how this will affect water resources downhill. But his team's predictions are also helping the region adapt to the changes and to improve early warning systems for landslides. A number of Alpine huts have already begun to subside as the ground beneath them shifts, he said. Anchors for cable cars and other infrastructure will also need to be stabilized. Some traditional climbing routes have been closed for safety reasons too. \"I think we have to be very quick in terms of understanding these changing permafrost systems. Because the only way we can make it safe is understanding where things happen and then to try to avoid having people there,\" Krautblatter added.\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 Ski resorts cling on against climate change The view from below The village of Schwaigen-Grafenaschau lies just northeast of the Zugspitze. Landslides were always a problem for this tiny community of just over 600 people, nestled at the foot of a small mountain. But they're becoming more frequent, explained Hubert Mangold,\u00a0the town's jovial, energetic mayor, dressed in denim shorts and a short-sleeved checkered shirt. Back in 2016 after heavy downpours, a slow mudflow of boulders and rocks flattened a 30-hectare (74 acres) area, burying 40-meter high trees, said Mangold, speaking in a thick Bavarian accent typical of the region. \"It was the biggest mudflow in Germany. It still is,\" he said, gesturing\u00a0to a bare spot on the otherwise forested mountainside Boulders and mud flattened this large area of forested mountainside following heavy rains in 2016 Nobody was hurt in the disaster but it cost the Bavarian forestry service and other private forestry businesses that operate in the woods a significant amount in damages. Mangold said the streets below the mudslide also had to be fixed. For him, there is no question it was all made more likely by climate change.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's connected to climate change, not because it rains more, but because it rains more in a short space of time,\" he said, adding that 80 liters of rain in 30 minutes is not an uncommon occurrence these days. \"You didn't have those quantities before.\" Read more:\u00a0 Germany's coastal lowlands under the shadow of climate change Researchers at the nearby Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research in the beloved Alpine holiday destination of Garmisch-Partenkirchen have made similar observations. \"It's having a big influence on snow,\" said Harald Kunstmann, a professor at the University of Augsburg and the institute's deputy director. \"Because the precipitation that once fell as snow in winter is now largely falling as rain. That means it doesn't stay on the ground, but flows directly away in winter, increasing the risk of flooding.\" The long look forward Kunstmann has been working with highly detailed computer models to predict how the Alpine region will look by 2050 as the climate changes, partly to help communities prepare for what's to come. A 20 percent increase in rainfall is projected by mid-century in the region. Will Zwinger's family still be selling sausages on the Zugspitze in 30 years time? If the world continues on its current trajectory and overshoots the 2 degrees Celsius warming limit agreed in Paris in 2015, that would mean warming of 4 degrees in the mountains, said Kunstmann. Historically, the Alps have been warming twice as fast as the global average. There are a number of theories as to why that is, but the professor believes none sufficiently explain the phenomenon. Read more:\u00a0 Germany's farmers feel the heat of climate change Read more: \u00a0 Climate change prompts Berlin to rethink water strategy But if the predictions do play out, one thing is for sure: the Alps will look very different in terms of snow, glaciers, plants and animals, and the rock face itself. Whether businesses such as the inn run by Toni Zwinger's family for nearly a century will survive even another 30 years is an open question.\u00a0 A golden cross sits on top of Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze, located in the Ammergauer Alps. This part of the Alps, and the mountain itself, are a big draw for visitors eager to ski, hike, climb or just cruise to the top in a cable car to have some food or a beer. But the mountains are feeling the impact of a warming world \u2014 at an alarming rate. It's September and unusually warm. So warm that some people wear shorts and T-shirts as they stop off to eat and explore the glacier plateau before heading for the summit. Thirty years ago, it would have been much colder here. Since 1985, there's been a warming of around 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit). In the Alps, temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average. Increased temperatures mean receding glaciers. Michael Krautblatter, pictured at the Schneefernerhaus environmental research station with the remnants of one of the Zugspitze's glaciers behind him, says \"it's just a matter of time before they disappear.\" The professor of landslide research at Munich's Technical University (TUM) has been studying the mountain's ice for 10 years. Krautblatter and his team use specialized equipment to measure the Zugspitze's ice and permafrost \u2014 a layer of permanently frozen sediment, rock or soil. They place electrodes inside the rocks to measure electrical conductivity. If it's no longer frozen, conductivity is good. The work sometimes involves the researchers scaling the mountain face. The permafrost is disappearing too, they say. That's bad news, largely because permafrost helps to stabilize the mountain rock. Over the past year, around a thousand rockfalls have been reported, says Krautblatter. Some popular hiking routes have already been closed and a dozen or so Alpine huts are subsiding. It could also be a problem for cable cars, because they are anchored in the rocks on the mountainside. Scientists aren't the only ones who've witnessed the changes. Toni Zwinger is 33 years old and works at the inn run by his family near the summit. He grew up on the mountain and as a child the glaciers were his playground. He says the glacier is much smaller, the winters are warmer and he hears the rocks shifting outside in the evening when the tourists have gone and the mountain is quiet. The M\u00fcnchner Haus opened in 1897 and the Zwinger family has been running it since 1925 \u2014 back when it could only be reached by climbers. It's a traditional Alpine hut in which people can stay overnight. Those people can now easily ascend the mountain by train and cable car. That's increased the number of visitors to the peak exponentially. Even if, as set out in the Paris Agreement, the world manages to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, that would represent warming of around 4 degrees in the Alps. That means less snow, more rain, changing vegetation and no glaciers. It could also mean that visitors will no longer be able to enjoy a beer or hot chocolate at the century-old M\u00fcnchner Haus.

Scientists are now racing to make plants more resistant. The alarming discovery of an increasing hole in the planet's ozone layer in 1985 led to a global ban on the production of CFCs, halons, and other ozone-depleting chemicals. As a result, the protective cocoon of gas that shields the earth from harmful solar radiation is now on the mend. Last year, NASA announced\u00a0that the hole in the ozone layer was much smaller than when first discovered. Read more: \u00a0 Healing the ozone layer: A ray of hope for planet Earth? But while the ozone present in the upper atmosphere works as a natural sunscreen blocking harmful ultraviolet rays, high ozone concentration on the ground is toxic for people's health, and damages vegetation and ecosystems. Ozone is a key component of smog. It is created by a chemical reaction between nitrogen oxide and pollutants emitted by cars and power plants in the presence of ultraviolet sunlight.\u202f Recent findings\u202fby the Royal Society, the UK's sciences academy, suggest ground-level ozone has increased by about two parts per billion (ppb) each decade since the 1980s. What's more, ozone levels have breached safety thresholds in many regions around the world, and have been linked to severe vegetation damage globally. \"These effects of ozone are also comparable to other stresses such as pests and diseases in plants, heat, and aridity,\" explained Ane Vollsnes, a researcher at the University of Oslo, citing\u202fa study\u202fthat shows ozone has the most damaging impact on plants compared to other factors. A 2017 study found that future warming and unmitigated ozone pollution in the US, could cause a decline\u00a0of 13% in wheat crops, 28% in soybean yield, and 43% in maize by 2050 when\u00a0compared to 2000. Surface ozone a concern in Arctic region Frode Stordal and Ane Vollsnes in Norway are researching how plants are damaged by ozone This clover plant is showing dead tissue after 9 hours of exposure to ozone Around the world, scientists are trying to understand the correlation between ground-level ozone and damage to vegetation. The ozone concentration rises when it's sunny, which\u00a0has led to big problems in countries like Norway and arctic regions that experience many hours of sunlight in summer. Read more:\u00a0 Climate change already affecting German farmers Ane Vollsnes and Frode Strodal at the University of Oslo have been tracing how ground-level ozone pollution affects plants, depending on how much sun they get. For their study, they exposed clover plants to ozone for three six-hour periods in their lab. \"In our experiments, the clovers were exposed to 70 ppb of ozone. In Europe, 70 ppb often occurs during the daytime in some regions, and it's not considered a very high level,\" Vollsnes told DW. They found that after a few hours, black spots started to appear on the clovers' leaves, indicating dead tissue.\u202fEven this brief exposure was enough to damage the plants by blocking their tiny pores called stomata, which help them breathe. Health effects of 'bad ozone' In contrast to oxygen's two atoms (O2), which are essential for the existence of life, the three atoms of oxygen (O3) that make up ozone can suffocate plants and animals when inhaled.\u202fIn humans, it can damage lung tissue. Ozone tends to block the small holes called alveoli in the lungs, aggravating respiratory problems such as shortness of breath, asthma attacks, and coughing. Long-term exposure to ozone is linked\u00a0to permanent health issues, such as abnormal lung development in children. Some of the highest levels of surface ozone in the world have been\u202ffound\u202fin parts of the western US, Norway, northwestern India, China, and Pakistan. That also means that crops in these regions are particularly at risk. Asthma patients and children are particularly at risk from ozone pollution Ozone in India killing crops that could feed 94 million India faces a distinct challenge to curb ozone-causing pollution as hot weather speeds up the chemical reactions that create ozone near the surface. The country is estimated to have suffered massive vegetation loss over the last two decades, according to a study by the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur. \"Our estimates show the highest annual loss of wheat of about 9 million tons in northern India, one of the most polluted regions in India, and about 2.6 million tons of rice in the eastern region,\" Shyam Lal Gupta, one of the lead authors, told DW. Read more: \u00a0 Europe's hot summer weather could worsen the effects of COVID-19 Similar recent studies by major institutes like\u202fthe University of Oslo,\u202fthe Indian Institute of Meteorology\u00a0and\u202fUK Centre of Ecology and Hydrology\u202findicate that crops in India face the impacts of ozone every winter whenever smog levels increase. It has led to a loss of two-thirds of the annual harvest in the states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. However, Gupta adds that more research needs to be done to show \"long-term trends in surface ozone over the Indian region.\" Basmati rice is one of the main export items of India Ozone mitigation According to Vollsnes, India and China will likely bear the brunt of ozone's damaging impact on food production. \"This is where population growth is the greatest, and the standard of living is increasing the most,\" Vollsnes told DW. \"This is happening at the same time as the need for food is increasing.\" The number of vehicles in India has nearly tripled in the past decade, with 130 million cars in 2013 compared to 50 million in 2003, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation.\u202f Nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from such vehicles create the ideal conditions for ozone to accumulate on the ground as temperatures rise due to global warming. A busy road in the middle of the day is caught in a haze in the smoggy Indian capital, Delhi Read more: \u00a0 Europe boils in record-setting heat wave That's why researchers like Shyam Lal Gupta are calling for new solutions. \"We have suggested that if the winter cropping season is shifted a bit earlier, when ozone levels are lower, it will have a positive effect on saving the crops,\" he said, but adds it might be difficult when the monsoon rains begin, as they can spoil crops that need dry conditions to grow \u2014 like wheat. \"The other suggestion is to produce a new variety of wheat and rice or of other crops, which will have lower damaging effects due to ozone,\" Gupta said. In a 2019 paper published in\u202fNature Communications, researchers at the University of California reported they had successfully prepared plants capable of surviving in different temperatures.\u00a0For instance, arabidopsis, a model plant, can grow at different times of the year as the season changes. Read more: \u00a0 How a farming project in Nepal is smashing caste bigotry This could potentially minimize ozone impacts on crop yields by helping plants grow all year round and avoid smog. It would be even more effective to reduce the levels of toxic surface ozone in the first place by mitigating pollution, but Gupta said\u00a0there's a lack of awareness surrounding the problem. \"We do not find any mitigation policy being implemented in India just for ozone,\" he said. \"However, efforts to control air pollution are being made by different government agencies. These efforts will also have effects on the levels of surface ozone.\" India is seeing reduced smog levels for the first time in many years thanks to a strict coronavirus lockdown. To date, climate negotiations have focused mainly on bringing down carbon emissions.\u202fBut without further efforts to regulate other poisonous emissions, rising temperatures and pollutants like nitrogen oxides will continue to form ground-level ozone. Annual carbon emissions from global agriculture can be reduced by as much as 90 percent by 2030, according to a new report released by Climate Focus and California Environmental Associates. That would be the equivalent of getting rid of all the cars in the world. The study highlights a range of strategies to mitigate carbon production in agriculture. Beef and dairy cows may seem sweet and harmless, but the methane they produce when they pass gas damages the atmosphere. This study suggests improving food quality on grazing lands and in factory farms. It's believed this will reduce the cows' gas production and even improve the quality and quantity of beef and dairy products. The report, called 'Strategies for Mitigating Climate Change in Agriculture' says the most important way to mitigate carbon production in agriculture is to reduce the amount of red meat and dairy people eat. Cattle farms and beef transports produce a lot of methane and carbon which trap heat, raising global temperatures. Burying biochar in crop fields is another way to capture and store carbon. Biochar is a type of charcoal produced when biomass burns in an oxygen-free environment. In addition to trapping carbon, it can increase the nutrient load in soil and support better crop yields. The international food system is extremely inefficient, the study reports. Around the world, at least 30 percent of edible food is being wasted due to poor management and ineffective policy. According to the report, China and India are using far too much synthetic fertilizer. The US is quite efficient in their fertilizer use. Synthetic fertilizers are created using by-products from the oil industry and are responsible for generating a lot of carbon dioxide. In China, coal is burned during the production of fertilizers. The factories are also outdated and inefficient. These two factors result is massive outputs of carbon dioxide. The report calls for China to invest in new equipment and improve energy use within this sector. Rice has one of the highest carbon footprints of any crop because wet farming systems produce a lot of methane. Better field management and draining the fields regularly could significantly reduce emissions. Plenty of carbon can be absorbed by trees and shrubs with crops. In humid or tropical highland areas, trees also provide shade and trap rainwater, preventing floods. Better protection of the world's forests could provide the planet with a natural carbon sink.

{"id": null, "body": "     With an eye to the climate change conference in Copenhagen, Deutsche Welle looks at global warming's winners and losers. The poor will be harshly affected, a leading scientist told DW, but everyone will feel the impact. We all share the same planet, scientists stress The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a study two years ago warning that human activity is likely contributing to global warming. Warmer temperatures of anywhere between 1.1 degrees Celsius and 6.4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, if the current trend continues sea levels would rise and essentially \"drown\" low-laying countries, Bangladesh and the Maldives would essentially disappear, the report said. In addition to rising sea levels, others finding in the report include severe droughts and stronger and more frequent tropical storms. This December, global leaders meeting at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen are slated to agree on a new climate pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. In the run-up to the conference, Deutsche Welle examines how the IPCC's assessment has been dealt with over the past two years by talking to Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, vice-chair of the IPCC, about the winners and losers of climate change. Deutsche Welle: The IPCC released an assessment in 2007 warning that human activity is a likely cause of global warming. What's the situation now? Severe droughts would cut off food supplies Jean-Pascal van Ypersele: Firstly, we have to make clear that it is not likely that climate change is due to human activities, but very likely, according to the last IPCC report. There's a big difference. \"Likely\" means a two-thirds probability, and \"very likely\" means a 90 percent probability - that's very close to certainty, that indeed the warming of the past 50 years is really due to human activity, so the controversies about that are really not relevant anymore. But while the impact of climate change varies for different regions, all of us will be affected by it. No region will be immune to it. Who will be the real losers of climate change? It is very clear from the last IPCC report, and confirmed again by recent scientific literature, that the main losers, or first losers, of climate change will be poor people both in developing countries and in developed or industrialized countries. It will be the poor that will be hit the hardest everywhere, and since there are more poor people in developing countries, they'll be hit first. What are some examples of the impact of climate change on poor people in developing countries? One important example is the melting of glaciers in the Andes. In the tropical Andes there's a rainy season that only lasts a few months and then it's very dry for a big proportion of the year. That means the glaciers are the water reservoirs - the snow and rain accumulate there in the mountains. When the glaciers melt, those water reservoirs, which have provided water to people for years and years, will simply not be there anymore. It's a catastrophe for hundreds of millions of people who depend on those reservoirs for drinking water and irrigating their agriculture. How will countries - like Bangladesh or the Maldives - be affected by rising sea levels? Rising sea levels will eat away at shorelines - and entire nations The water is rising there because water expands when it is heated, and because of the glaciers melting. So for low-lying countries, or regions, like 17 percent of Bangladesh being at less than one meter above the present sea level\u2026or Egypt being another example - there's an area of the Nile Delta which is at less than one meter above the sea level. Approximately 10 million people live and work there, cultivating crops. If the sea level increases by one meter, which is certainly possible by the beginning of the next century, those people would have to flee the elevating water. How will other countries in Asia be affected by climate change? There are examples in agriculture: agricultural species which are already very close to their limits in favorable temperatures for their cultivation. If temperature increases by just one degree in tropical regions in Asia, many species would see their yields decrease. So that presents big problems for food security in those countries. Desertification is another issue. The increased frequency or intensity of droughts deforms land that was once cultivated or supported ecosystems, turning them into deserts or semi-arid areas. Can one simplify the issue by saying the African continent will be most impacted by climate change through desertification, and Asia, say, by increased rainfall? Africa will experience severe water problems as a result of climate change That's too simplified. It really varies from one region to the next, and even one sub-region. For example, the availability of fresh water in central and southeast Asia is going to decrease. In other areas of Asia, it's the elevation of the sea level that will be a problem. In Africa, it's mostly the impacts on rain-fed agriculture, which could see its yields decrease by up to 50 percent. In other coastal regions, it's mostly the rising sea level that will be a problem. Africa, however, will certainly be one of the regions most affected by climate change because of its stage of development, but there will be negative effects everywhere. What about the losers of climate change in industrialized countries? In the summer of 2003, approximately 50,000 Europeans died because of the heat wave. That kind of heat wave cannot be univocally related to climate change, but what is very clear is that the frequency of such heat waves is going to increase significantly by the middle of this century - like the one in 2003, which could become like an average summer. IPCC Vice-Chair Jean-Pascal van Ypersele We're already seeing negative effects in North America as well. Heat waves will be an increasing problem, as will the intensity of tropical storms. Look at Katrina in 2005. Again, there's no univocal link between Katrina and climate change, or that climate change caused the hurricane. But you can say that events like Katrina will occur more frequently or with more intensity in the vicinity of North America and the Caribbean. Who will be the winners of climate change? There will winners in an initial phase, in the coming decades, mostly in temperate countries in North America and northern Europe, for instance. Warmer temperatures will allow crop cultivation to occur for a longer period - the growing season will increase in length. But that's only a temporary effect. At some point, it will become too hot there as well. Then, you don't have winners anymore, you have losers everywhere.

Her parents used to have a small piece of land, but floods wiped out their harvest. \"I tried to negotiate, to tell my parents that I wasn't ready, that I didn't want to get married, but they told me that I had to because that would mean one mouth less at the table.\" Sande lives in Malawi's Nsanje province. Her story is one of thousands of cases highlighted in a recent study from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) . Two years in the making, the\u00a0report\u00a0is the largest and most comprehensive study to date on the effects of climate change and environmental degradation on gender-based violence. Read more: \u00a0 Climate change: A catalyst for conflict \"This study shows us that the damage humanity is inflicting on nature can also fuel violence against women around the world \u2014 a link that has so far been largely overlooked,\" said Grethel Aguilar, IUCN's acting director general. \"This study adds to the urgency of halting environmental degradation alongside action to stop gender-based violence in all its forms, and demonstrates that the two issues often need to be addressed together.\" Child marriages as 'survival strategy' Malawi isn't the only place where minors are being married against their will to help their families survive climate disasters. According to the study, girls in Ethiopia and South Sudan are also being sold off in marriage during extreme droughts , in exchange for cattle. Juliane Schmucker, the regional director for Asia at humanitarian organization Plan International, said the rate of child and forced marriages demonstrably increases in crisis situations. \"It's simply a survival strategy: to get rid of a daughter to relieve the pressure on the family, or it's the only way to generate income,\" she told DW. Growing resource scarcity also increases the risk that women and girls will be victims of violence. With increasing drought and desertification in the global south, more and more water sources and wells are drying up. Fetching water is often a woman's job, and if they're forced to walk farther for that water\u00a0the risk of sexual assault also increases, especially in regions characterized by armed gangs. Walking to collect water can put women in dangerous situations The same risk applies to gathering firewood, said Dirk Bathe, spokesman for the international aid organization World Vision. \"That's why we build wells in the villages directly, or nearby, and try through reforestation efforts to plant trees near settlements,\" he told DW. In so doing, they often rely on farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR), a planting technique which uses felled tree stumps and underground root systems. It was awarded a Right Livelihood Award , also known as the alternative Nobel Prize, in 2018. In addition to practical measures, aid organizations have also called for changes to traditional gender roles. \"We've seen great success when religious leaders use their influence to make it clear that men have no right to inflict violence against women,\" said Bathe. It's also important that girls and women know who they can contact after an assault, and that they're encouraged to do so, added Schmucker. Sex for fish Women living on many of Africa's coasts and lakes have also suffered as fish have become scarcer. Fishermen peddling their wares are now not only expecting money as payment \u2014 they're also demanding sex. According to the IUCN study, this practice is now so common in western Kenya that it has a name: the Jaboya system. World Vision has tried to counteract this form of sexual exploitation, in particular in the eastern African region around Lake Victoria, where women have been given the opportunity to breed fish in ponds. \"This way, they can now set up their own businesses and sell fish without getting into violent situations,\" said Bathe. With fish scarce, some fishermen in Kenya now expect sex in addition to money Fish ponds can provide wome with a means of generating their own income Read more: \u00a0 Living in the shadows of violence and development Both World Vision and Plan International also confirmed another of the study's observations: In places where women are responsible for agriculture, a sudden natural disaster or extreme weather event can have a dramatic effect on their social and family standing. If harvests are threatened or wiped out altogether, this can lead to violence \u2014 often from within their own families. \"Diversifying their sources of income is the most important way to protect women,\" said Schmucker. \"If we help women to adapt to climate change and improve their income situation, everyone benefits \u2014 including children and men,\" said Bathe. In Bangladesh, many women prefer to ride out natural disasters in their homes rather than in emergency shelters Traditional societal roles lead to death Women and girls can suffer terribly in extreme weather situations and during natural disasters, when societies dictate certain behaviors and prohibit others, such as being out in public alone. Women are also more likely to die as a result of flooding in Bangladesh, said Gotelind Alber of the gender equality network Women for Climate Justice, because they rarely seek refuge in emergency shelters. \"These shelters are very cramped, and for a Bangladeshi woman it's not appropriate to stand there face-to-face with men, or to use the same toilet,\" she said. \"That's why most women prefer to barricade themselves in their huts, where they're often simply washed away by the floods.\" Read more: \u00a0 Climate change threatens peace efforts: SIPRI But men also die because of these traditional societal roles,\u00a0Alber continued. \"In Australia, men are much more likely to commit suicide than women if they lose their land or their job,\" she said. \"Men receive significantly less help than women in crisis situations, which is primarily related to the traditional view of masculinity.\" Honduran rights activist Berta Caceres was shot and killed inside her home after leading a movement against a dam project Environmental crimes, such as poaching and illegal resource extraction, can also lead to gender-based violence. According to the IUCN study, threats and sexual violence such as rape are often used to target environmental activists to undermine their status within the community, and to prevent other women from working to preserve the environment from the construction of a new mine or dam, for example. Similar strategies are also used in industrialized nations , as women who work on environmental issues are threatened with rape on social media in order to intimidate and silence them. Read more: \u00a0 Environmental activist alleged murderers go on trial Still no climate justice in Germany \u00a0The issue of gender and climate has, however, been a prominent feature of UN climate conferences since 2012. At the most recent summit in Madrid in December participating states agreed on the second Gender Action Plan, with the goal to put women on an equal footing on all levels of climate policy \u2014 in institutions, but also in individual climate protection projects. The aim is to reduce structural gender inequalities around the world. These inequalities also exist in Western industrialized societies, explained Alber. She referred to Germany's Climate Protection Act, which plans to introduce higher CO2 prices in the coming years \u2014 increases which will especially affect poorer people. Read more: \u00a0 Climate risk: Insuring against the inevitable That includes many retirees and single parents, most of whom are women. According to Alber, if climate protection in Germany is to be equal for both genders, the government has to offer a better compensation than a simple commuter tax relief scheme. As places around the world become more arid and suffer from increasing drought and deforestation, wooded areas are disappearing. According to a new study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), women, particularly those living in the global south, are being forced to walk farther and farther to find firewood for cooking \u2014 and are increasingly at risk of being raped. By taking a close look at more than 1,000 case studies in developing countries, the IUCN revealed that the number of child marriages increases during periods of drought and major flooding. When food becomes scarce, families will often try to marry off their daughters \u2014 either in exchange for cattle, or simply to have one less mouth to feed. In places where women are responsible for agriculture, a sudden natural disaster or extreme weather event can have a dramatic effect on their social and family standing. If harvests are threatened or wiped out altogether, this can lead to violence \u2014 often from within their own families. Helping women diversify their sources of income is one of the most important ways of avoiding this outcome. Many men are forced to leave their homelands because climate change makes it hard to find a job. The women who stay behind have to deal with the consequences of a changing natural world alone. Stereotypical societal roles for men and women can mean the death rate is significantly higher for women during natural disasters. It often falls to women to take care of old people and children. This ties them to the home, where they can be more vulnerable to hurricanes or floods. Women and girls remain at risk even after natural disasters have ended. Just one example: If emergency accommodation doesn't offer protected rooms, they can be vulnerable to violence by men when they use the shower or toilet facilities. Women who fight for environmental causes are particularly in danger. According to the IUCN study, men will threaten or even commit sexual violence in order to undermine a woman's status within the community, and to prevent other women from supporting environmental causes. This is often the case in South America, where women have spoken out against new dam or mine projects.

{"id": null, "body": "     Children from India, Philippines and several African countries were \"extremely high-risk,\" the new UNICEF report found. Climate activist Greta Thunberg said world leaders must act instead of just talking. Children collecting water from a river in Rosario, Argentina Close to one billion children were classified as \"extremely high-risk\"\u00a0with the climate crisis threatening their health , education, and protection, exposing them to potentially fatal diseases, a new climate report from the UN's children's agency. \"For the first time, we have a complete picture of where and how children are vulnerable to climate change, and that picture is almost unimaginably dire,\" said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF executive director. \"Climate and environmental shocks are undermining the complete spectrum of children's rights, from access to clean air, food and safe water; to education, housing, freedom from exploitation, and even their right to survive. Virtually no child's life will be unaffected,\" she added. Titled \"The Climate Crisis Is a Child Rights Crisis\", the UNICEF report found that nearly half of the world's 2.2 billion children living in 33 countries were \"extremely high-risk.\" These include several African nations, such as\u00a0the Central African Republic, Chad, Nigeria, Guinea.\u00a0India\u00a0and the Philippines were also classified in the same manner. They \"face a deadly combination of exposure to multiple climate and environmental shocks with a high vulnerability due to inadequate essential services, such as water and sanitation, healthcare and education,\" the report found. While the findings showcased the number of children impacted today, it said the figures were likely to get worse as the impacts of climate change accelerated. Many regions in Russia have been burning for weeks, with the area around Yakutia in the far northeast having been hit particularly hard. The authorities have counted more than 250 fires currently burning across Russia, covering a total area of more than 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres). But it's not just the fires that are causing problems for locals. Dense smoke has been drifting across populated areas, for example the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. This is especially hard for the elderly and children, as it's nearly impossible to breathe outside. Evacuees on a ferry at the port of Pefki, Euboea \u2014 they are embarking on a journey into the unknown, as their homes and belongings will probably be destroyed by the time they return. For the first time since the forest fires started on the Greek island of Euboea at the beginning of last week, massive air missions are now being flown to fight the fires. Eyewitnesses report apocalyptic scenes. But not everyone is fleeing \u2014 many local residents want to support the firefighters. At times, that can include desperate acts \u2014 such as with this man, who\u2019s trying to beat out flames with a tree branch. Such autonomous actions are causing a major problem for the authorities, as through them, many people are placing themselves in grave danger. Besides Greece and Italy, Turkey is also struggling with devastating fires. Walls of fire are spreading from the forests to residential areas. On this photo, Turkish firefighters are trying to stop a blaze near Cokertme that threatens to spread into buildings. More than 150,000 hectares \u2014 including entire villages \u2014 have already fallen victim to the flames in Turkey. More than 5,700 fires are currently raging in the West Coast state of California \u2014 and the typical wildfire season there has not even started yet. The Dixie Fire is now the second-largest in the state's history, and completely destroyed the town of Greenville. In this photo, a fire crew member keeps an eye out for spot fires to slow the wildfire near the town of Westwood. In California, whirlwinds of ash and embers, such as this one that meandered through the Santa Barbara hills, are complicating matters. West Coast fires have even been creating their own weather. With the situation more devastating than in previous years, governors of affected states have turned to Washington for help \u2014 they are urgently seeking more emergency staff and firefighting aircraft. Author: Claudia Dehn Climate activist Greta Thunberg said that the latest report confirmed that children will be impacted inordinately, urging world leaders to take action instead of just talking when they meet in Glasgow for this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26).\u00a0 \"I don't expect them to do that, but I would be more than happy if they could prove me wrong,\" said Thunberg, 18, as the index was published on the third anniversary of Fridays For Future.\u00a0 The global youth movement began with Thunberg's solo protest outside her school in Sweden. She was joined by young activists around the world. Philippines' Mitzi Jonelle Tan, 23, shared experiences of doing homework by candlelight with typhoons raging outside or facing the fear of drowning in her bed as floodwaters entered her room. World leaders' \"empty promises and vague plans\" were not enough, Tan said. \"There's no excuse for this COP... to not be the one that changes things.\" \n see/rc (Reuters, dpa) \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "No child will escape the impact of climate change: UNICEF", "article_name": "no-child-will-escape-the-impact-of-climate-change-unicef", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/no-child-will-escape-the-impact-of-climate-change-unicef/a-58914515", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 5265, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:02:49.960017"}
{"id": null, "body": "     \nClimate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the world today - and it is set to have a huge impact on generations to come. But what is it, and why is it important? Find out, and explore our interactive map!\n Explore DW's interactive map on the impacts of climate change! To get started in the graphic above, click on one of the categories on the left or on one of the points in the regions. Don't blame it on the weatherman Climate refers to the weather typical for a particular region. So when people talk about \"climate change,\" we are actually referring to changes in normal weather patterns across the globe. The term \"climate change\" is often used interchangeably with \"global warming,\" which refers to an increase in the average temperature of the planet. But actual climate change goes beyond warming to include weather extremes, including more frequent and heavier storms, longer and more intense drought, or even unusually cold weather. The human touch The climate is always changing, including due to natural forces such as the distance of the earth from the sun or volcanic activity. But in recent decades, scientists have begun to look at how human activity has been affecting the climate. The scientific consensus is that human-caused release of greenhouse gases is currently causing the climate to change. In other words, driving, flying, agriculture, deforestation and many other human activities are contributing to increasing temperatures and resulting unstable weather. Burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity contributes to climate change It's getting warm in here Such human activities emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which act as a heat-trapping blanket around the earth. This so-called greenhouse effect is increasing temperatures, which is leading to changes in the weather, melting ice caps and rising sea levels. Moving on Animals can be affected in a number of different ways. In many ecosystems, changing weather affects growth of native plants, or makes conditions less suitable for local animals. But warmer weather also provides a boon to some species, which are able to migrate to new regions where they had not typically been found before. These invasive species can cause problems for other animals that are native to the region. For example, warming-related pest infestations have killed millions of acres of trees in the American West, while increased water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean is helping the spread of tropical fish such as the poisonous lionfish. Beautiful, but deadly: the lionfish is invading new regions in the Atlantic Climate victims and refugees Humans are also being ever more affected by the results of climate change. People living on low-lying islands such as Kiribati, in the Pacific, are being displaced by rising sea levels, which are eroding the land. More severe weather conditions are also affecting countries like the Philippines and the Bahamas, which has experienced stronger storms - conditions that some scientists have attributed to climate change. The UN estimates that hundreds of thousands of people have been killed as a result of weather catastrophes in the last 20 years. Insecurity and war Increasingly, politicians and academics are also looking at climate change as a security threat. Changing weather is leading to food and water shortages, which cause problems in already unstable regions, such as in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Clear cause More than 80 percent of the CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere comes from the burning of fossil fuels - and almost half of that is from the energy sector, according to the World Bank. China is the country that emits most CO2, followed by the United States, and then the European Union bloc. A global solution Ministers and heads of state from more than 190 governments across the world will be meeting in Paris for the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21, with the aim of creating a new global climate agreement that would be implemented from 2020 onward. The goal for the climate summit, to be held in Paris, is to get countries to agree to emission targets that will ensure that average global temperature does not rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Limiting change The 2-degree limit is an internationally agreed goal. While it won't stop the impact of the changes that have already been put into motion, experts say it will prevent the worst of the effects. Global temperatures have already risen by around 0.85 degrees Celsius - and, according to the United Nations, will continue to rise by around 0.5 degrees Celsius even if emissions were to immediately stop. What you can do It might feel like there is very little you can do to affect what is seen as one of the biggest challenges facing the world today. But every little bit helps. Deciding to walk or cycle instead of driving can cut CO2 emissions, as can learning to turn off lights and the heating when you are not at home. If you are feeling a little more ambitious, you can also check out what some of Europe's climate heroes have been doing to combat climate change - maybe they will inspire you toward further action! The UN climate summit in Paris has some tough nuts to crack: With global temperatures and CO2 emissions breaking records, greenhouse gas cuts pledged so far will not keep global warming to the agreed-upon limit. (25.11.2015)\n\u00a0 Climate change skeptics argue that humans are not to blame for climate change, and they often cherrypick scientific facts to support their argument.

{"id": null, "body": "     Some people are skeptical that human activity is driving global warming. We take a look at the most common arguments used by climate deniers, and set the record straight. Despite a 97 percent scientific consenus on the issue, some still dispute the idea that human activity is causing climate change . With this year's Earth Day focusing on climate and environmental literacy, DW examines some of the most common myths and misconceptions used by climate change skeptics. 1. If global warming is real, then why are we still experiencing record-cold winters? Isn't the planet supposed to be getting hotter? It is true that we have observed colder temperatures in some areas. The winter of 2009 to 2010 in particular was unusually cold in Europe, and overall sea ice around Antarctica has even increased somewhat. But it would be wrong to use this as evidence against global warming. Many different factors influence the Earth's climate, alongside human activity. The El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon is the main culprit of these bizarre weather patterns. Every four years or so during the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, warmer-than-usual sea surface temperatures appear along the South American west coast, which affects trade winds around the world and can feed into large winter storms in areas like Europe. Although sea ice in Antarctica seems immune for now, ice cover in the Arctic Circle has reduced dramatically in recent years Although ice cover in the Antarctic has increased in recent years, the exact opposite is occurring in the Arctic Circle, where there is currently less ice than any winter in recorded history. The Antarctic is lucky in the sense that it is surrounded by strong winds and ocean currents, which protects it from outside climate influences to some extent. But the reality is that an increase in average temperatures on Earth has been observed since systemic measurements begin back in 1880. The year 2016 was the warmest on record, with 2015 and 2014 taking second and third place, respectively. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the average global temperature has increased 0.85 degrees Celsius (about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit) from 1880 to 2012. So although there will always be outlying cold weather events, there is really no disputing\u00a0that the temperature\u00a0is in fact increasing around the world. 2. The Earth has heated and cooled throughout its history - climate change is a natural phenomenon. Humans have had nothing to do with it in the past, this current warming is just a natural fluctuation. Yes, the Earth's climate has changed many times over the course of millions of years as part of natural environmental processes.\u00a0 But the scary thing is that this particular warming phase, over the last 50 to 150 years, has occurred much faster than any other time in history. Climate change skeptics often argue that CO2 emissions from human activity alone could not influence the Earth's climate to such an extent. They point to the fact that CO2 emissions also come from other sources such as volcanoes,\u00a0and that high levels are naturally controlled by plants and the permafrost cycle. The problem is that our greenhouse gas emissions disrupt the existing balance, whereby the planet is unable to absorb and release the CO2 as it normally would. This problem is made even worse due to increased deforestation. An increase in carbon emissions caused by burning fossil fuels has caused an imbalance in the Earth's atmosphere The IPCC considerers it \"highly probable\" that human influence has been the primary cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. Since 1750, the concentration of CO2 has increased by 40 percent, and methane by 150 percent. Although skeptics also often try and highlight the 3 percent of scientists who are not certain that human activity is driving climate change, these researchers are frequently from conservative think tanks such as the Cato Institute, which is funded by companies such as Volkswagen and other groups that rely on the continued use of fossil fuels. 3. We can't even accurately predict tomorrow's weather forecast. How can we be sure of what our climate will look like 100 years from now?\u00a0 It's a common enough scenario: you check the weather forecast and are excited to see sunshine predicted for the weekend. But instead, you are disappointed by grey skies and rain. It's important to know that the weather forecast and climate models are essentially two different things. The weather is short-term, often unpredictable, and is influenced by a variety of factors. The climate, on the other hand, is long-term, and unpredictable weather events get balanced statistically. It is much easier to observe an increase in global temperatures over several decades, as opposed to predicting changes in weather on an hour-by-hour basis. According to the IPCC, the reliability of climate forecasts has improved significantly in recent years, so we can be confident in their predictions - and hopefully act accordingly .\u00a0 4. So what if the temperature increases by a couple degrees? The Earth is resilient, it will pull through like it has\u00a0before. At face value, in increase of 2 or 3 degrees doesn't seem like much at all. But on a global level, even a minor change in temperature can have extreme consequences. Just a few degrees increase in global temperature could lead to more extreme weather events such as drought This translates into an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts and storms - even wildfire . Sea levels are rising due to melting glaciers, and many highly populated areas increasingly\u00a0find themselves underwater. And if we don't start implementing ambitious climate protection goals soon, the IPCC says the average global temperature could rise by 5.4 degrees by\u00a0the end of the 21st century. The Earth's climate is unpredictable by nature, and its inhabitants have had to adapt themselves many times in the past. But natural adaptation has its limits - and we are running out of time to mitigate the more severe consequences of manmade climate change. Some 10,500 firefighters were called to tackle forest fires in California in 2015. They were unable to prevent 1,400 homes from destruction. The blaze was fueled by hot and dry weather - as a result of climate change. The polar bear has become a symbol of climate change, as its habitat is threatened by global warming. The Arctic predator hunts from ice sheets that are fast disappearing. As the ice retreats, they are unable to stalk their prey, and risk starvation. By 2050, scientists warn that the Arctic could be ice-free in summer. Just visible from the air is a little wood hut on the island of Spitzbergen in Norway. It is home to the Arctic research base where French and German scientists are studying climatic and atmospheric changes in the polar region, including the damage done to permafrost and glacier systems. A goat watches a mountain expedition on the Swiss Aletsch Glacier, a UNESCO World Heritage site. It was around a kilometer longer in 1860 than it is today. Due to global warming, the glacier is shrinking by up to 50 meters per year. With the rate of retreat increasing, scientists fear Europe's biggest glacier could disappear altogether. \u2026 the landscape looks peaceful, bathed in a mystical light. But the actual situation is far more unsettling. This aerial view shows Central Luzon in the Philippines, completely flooded after it was hit by a typhoon and heavy rain. People were drowned or buried under landslides, and half a million were forced to flee their homes. The country is hit by 20 typhoons each year. \u2026 escape is all that's left. The World Bank warns that if global warming continues unimpeded, another 100 million people will be under threat. Poor people in parts of Africa and South Asia are at particular risk. Drought and flooding threaten crops - leading to hunger, disease and high food prices. Climate change often hits children the hardest, through no fault of their own. Studies have found that economic problems exacerbated by drought can have profound social impacts, such as in an increase in child marriages, for example. Families may marry off their underage daughters earlier to have fewer mouths they have to feed. Elephants produce huge quantities of manure. At Munich's Hellabrunn Zoo in Germany, one local utility is turning their waste into electric power. Around 2,000 tons of biowaste provides enough power for a hundred homes. Could this be a model for an African school? In any case, climate change is forcing new ways of thinking in the search for green energy. The Rhine River is Europe's busiest waterway for shipping - but climate change is affecting business. Ongoing drought means shipping firms would be forced to use shorter vessels that can navigate shallower waters. If ships aren't able to set off, more goods have to be transported by road - which is more expensive. Healthy coral reefs are like a blooming garden. But global warming is bleaching the life out of them. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae, which are vital to their health. But as the water heats up, they expel the algae. If warmer water temperatures persist, a lack of nutrients calcifies the corals, which makes their color fade and causes the organisms to die. Global warming also has its benefits. In recent years, wine is being produced on Germany's northernmost island, Sylt. Ever more vineyards are being established at higher altitudes and further north - even Scandinavia now has some. Global warming also means earlier harvests and sweeter grapes.

We need to have a conversation about how ambitious we are going to be on climate, on\u00a0nature and its protection and on the pollution load we are willing to let into our planet and our terrestrial and marine environments. Degraded land is often not put to use How do you see the relationship between halting climate change and protecting the environment? We need to focus on investing in what I like to refer to as \"nature's infrastructure.\" We need to invest in greenery and we need to invest in forests. There are about one to 1.5 billion hectares of degraded forest land\u00a0which are not used for anything, so let's invest in that, grow trees. If we were to do that, nature would give us a break of about 12 gigatons of carbon. And when we invest in nature, we also get biodiversity back.\u00a0 When we invest in nature we also ensure that we get better health outcomes. So there are lots of good outcomes from investing in nature. Read more:\u00a0 World must invest $1.8 trillion to take on climate change \u2014 report That all sounds very good, but we're not doing terribly well right now. We are not. And I guess the issue is that these are difficult choices. It's difficult to make those shifts rapidly, but thinking of it on the bigger global scale, shortly after 2050, there will be nearly 10 billion people on this planet. And today we have about 800 million people going to bed hungry and about 1.3 billion living in extreme poverty. These people have every right\u00a0 to aspire to what you and I have. But if we all live like you and I, we would need five planets. So the truth of the matter is, we need to have this conversation. The good news is that governments are stepping up. Businesses are stepping up. Our children are in the street demanding this and calling us out as a generation that has failed them on climate action. Inger Andersen is the new Executive Director of the UNEP Do you think we could be at a kind of turning point with movements like Fridays for Future , Extinction Rebellion and so on? I\u00a0think we have never seen so much awareness around environmental matters. I think that\u00a0awareness is something that politicians of any shade or color better pay attention to because these young people may be 16 today but a couple of years from now, they will be voting. So I do think that yes, this is part of a turning point but we need to have the solutions and the solutions are there. There are some important governments in the world whose priorities are not protecting the environment. What can an organization like UNEP do for instance when the government in Brazil opens the rainforest to more logging and development? Tropic forest is absolutely key to ensuring the stability of the planet's climate. We speak to facts and data and to evidence, and the evidence and the data is very very clear that it is absolutely imperative that we protect the large tropical forests wherever they may be in Africa in the Americas or in Asia. According to Weather Source, over 6,900 fires have been recorded in Angola and 3,400 in DR Congo this week; compared to over 2,000 in Brazil. But experts say it's difficult to compare. \"Fire in Africa... is part of a cycle, people in the dry season set fire to bush rather than to dense, moist rainforest,\" said Greenpeace's Philippe Verbelen. Almost a million hectares (3860 square miles) of forest and farmland have been destroyed in Bolivia over the past few weeks by largely unchecked wildfires, with scientists and indigenous leaders already branding it the country's biggest disaster for biodiversity. Small farmers often practice the slash-and-burn method \u2014 known locally as chaqueo \u2014 as a quick and easy way to clear land. The start of the dry season has sparked Indonesia's worst annual fire season since 2015. A state of emergency has been declared in six provinces, including Sumatra and the Riau Islands. Like Brazil, Indonesia is home to some of our planet's oldest tropical forests, but large areas have been lost to agriculture or other commercial interests. A wildfire raged through the Spanish holiday island for over a week this month, threatening several parks rich in biodiversity and forcing thousands to evacuate. Spain is often threatened by massive forest fires, especially during the hot, arid summer months. Experts say climate change means these events will likely become more severe and frequent. Large swathes of land in Siberia have been engulfed by wildfires this season, prompting a state of emergency in four regions. Forest fires are a natural event in Siberia, but unusually warm weather this summer combined with strong winds meant a record 5.5 million hectares of forest was burning by mid-August, creating a cloud of smoke which covered a greater area than the EU! Greece is on high alert as hot, windy weather fuels dozens of fires across the country. Hundreds of people had to be evacuated from the holiday island of Samos. Fires in Greece are often blamed on people ignoring safety rules during severe weather conditions, such as throwing away lit cigarettes or barbequing outdoors. More than 100 people were killed in a wildfire outside Athens in July 2018. Australia is no stranger to bushfires. But they are becoming increasingly common even during the winter months thanks to warmer-than-usual temperatures. Tinder-dry conditions have forced some states to bring forward the start of the bushfire danger season to August 1. Between August 22 - 23 this year Australia recorded 768 bushfires \u2014 slightly higher than the number of blazes burning in Bolivia. Beginning on June 8, three wildfires in Central Arizona have burned through 14,000 acres of land. Wildfire season is usually quite active in Arizona due to its dry climate. Unless they pose a threat to human life, many fires are contained and managed rather than suppressed. On average, over 2% of the land has burned per decade since 1984 \u2014 a figure likely to increase as the climate warms.  Author: Ineke Mules If we take another difficult example, for instance the USA under President Trump . How can you still be optimistic with all of those things going on in the background? You can't be an environmentalist in 2019 and not be an optimist. Because clearly there are challenges but there are also solutions . And what I see is that there is a commitment from American CEOs. There is a commitment from the American populace, from state governments and there is a strong commitment amongst the business community to lean in on climate positive actions. Is there a danger that the speed of climate change and environmental degradation is overtaking our scientific research and the speed with which politicians are taking action? There is absolutely that danger. But we still need the science to keep informing us.\u00a0The science, yes it evolves and it has to be there to tell us other actions that we need to be mindful of. The earlier\u00a0scenarios, those we discussed in Copenhagen in 2009 when we agreed on the 2 degrees, we now know that those scenarios are no longer as viable as\u00a0what the 1.5 degree report tells us.

We're seeing\u00a0 a number of countries introduce bans. Today we have 27 countries in Africa that have banned single-use plastic bags. How do you see the role of Africa as we\u00a0try to bring about a transition to sustainable societies without limiting the opportunities of countries in the developing world? We all need to understand that Africa's aspiration is no different than those of other countries in earlier times. That means Africa will be wanting to invest, and rightly so, in infrastructure. But why go through a polluting age like my country and yours did. Why not leapfrog right into the green economy ? And that's a real opportunity that many African countries are grabbing. Kenya has invested more than one billion dollars in renewables. Poorer countries want wealth, they want growth, they want the opportunity to have what you and I have. But in a smarter way. And the solutions are there because today we have energy options that are cleaner. So there is a chance to hop over a polluting age \u2014\u00a0if we get it right. The interview was conducucted by Irene Quaile and has been condensed and edited for clarity. Although there is a combination of factors behind the numerous jellyfish that reach vacation havens like the Mediterranean coast, climate change is also partially to blame. Warmer sea temperatures are opening up new areas where jellyfish can reproduce, and increasing the availability of their favorite food: plankton. Prized for their superior sound quality, an original Stradivarius can sell for millions of dollars. Yet, extreme weather events, such as unusually violent storms, are killing millions of trees, putting at risk the famous wood in the Paneveggio forest, in northern Italy. Replanting trees won't help much in the short term. A spruce has to be at least 150 years old before it can become a violin. On very hot nights, people sleep worse, especially in big cities. By 2050 European metropolises may experience temperatures around 3.5 degrees Celsius warmer in summer. It not only affects sleep, but also mood, productivity and mental health. The only way to escape is to move to smaller towns and settlements, where the nights are cooler since there are fewer buildings and more greenery. Spring is starting earlier in the year due to global warmer temperatures \u2014 bad news for allergy sufferers. With a longer frost-free season, plants have more time to grow, bloom and produce pollen. Therefore, pollen will freely roam around much earlier, which will make the suffering season longer and the annual pollen load greater. Will it be the century of masks for air pollution and allergies? Heat not only makes us sweat; it also affects our health. By the end of this century three-quarters of the world's population is expected to be exposed to dangerous and deadly heat waves. Rising temperatures mean an increase in diarrheal diseases, as it's easier for bacteria to multiply in warm food and water. Mosquito numbers will also likely go up, along with the spread of diseases like malaria. Soil in the region around the North Pole is increasingly thawing in the summer months, with dramatic local and global consequences. Warmer temperatures cause floors to become unstable and houses and roads to crack, and leads to many more insects. Moreover, if permafrost \u2014 frozen soil \u2014 melts, it will release CO2 and methane gases that could further exacerbate global warming. It's a vicious circle. Temperature can influence the sex of several species. For sea turtles, the heat of the sand where the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the newborn. Low temperatures benefit male turtles, while females develop better in warmer areas. Researchers have found that over 99% of turtle hatchlings in northern Australia are already female, making it difficult for the species to survive.

{"id": null, "body": "     The growing debate over how to combat climate change has increased pressure on Bundesliga clubs to reduce CO2 emissions. The clubs have become quite active in this regard, but there's still no league-wide strategy. \"Climate change and sustainability were not easy topics back then,\"\u00a0remembers Hanno Franke, thinking back almost 25 years and almost sounding as if he\u2019s trying to defend himself. The SC Freiburg marketing director has been at the club since the mid-1990s, a time when the Sport-Club from the Black Forest became the first Bundesliga club to begin taking measures to protect the environment. \"The club wasn\u2019t sure of its own identity, its own DNA,\"\u00a0Franke explains. \"But even then, the city of Freiburg took sustainability very seriously so it seemed logical that we as a football club should get involved as well. Many people advised us against it. Back then, some of our advisers warned us about being 'too green.'\" One of the main ideas was the installation of solar panels on the roof of the Schwarzwaldstadion\u2019s new south stand (pictured above). It's common measure by today's standards, with many Bundesliga clubs producing their own solar energy, but in the mid-1990s, Freiburg were ahead of the curve and faced stiff opposition. Former longtime Freiburg coach Volker Finke with the club's marketing director, Hanno Franke \"Looking back, the club showed a great deal of courage and conviction and laid the groundwork for everything that followed,\"\u00a0says Franke, with barely concealable pride. The Bundesliga goes green Today, all Bundesliga clubs are\u00a0aware of their environmental responsibilities, which can be divided into four main areas: traffic and emissions, waste, water and energy. But it's taken some clubs longer than others, with some only becoming \"greener\"\u00a0when environmentally friendly measures also allowed them to save money. \"For a long time, environmental protection didn't play a role in football at all,\"\u00a0says Thomas Fischer of the Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), a German environmental and consumer-protection agency that\u00a0carries out regular surveys of Bundesliga clubs. \"But those days are over.\" Thomas Fischer of Deutsche Umwelthilfe However, Fischer still thinks more can be done.\u00a0 \"Clubs are great at implementing green policies when they don't require any investment in infrastructure, such as using green energy or installing LED lights which save energy.\" In recent years, clubs have begun to expand their climate protection portfolios more or less off their own backs, or in cooperation with local businesses. In March 2019, the 36 professional clubs in Germany\u2019s top three leagues came together to discuss environmental solutions, but there is still no central coordination through\u00a0the German Football League (DFL). No collective\u00a0strategy \"The Bundesliga is still lacking a general climate plan,\"\u00a0laments Fischer, who would like to see clubs pool their activities for climate protection. \"The DFL needs to set environmental targets and provide instructions and guidelines to help clubs implement concrete measures.\"\u00a0No such guidelines currently exist and the DFL is yet to respond to questions sent by DW. In some areas, clubs are already implementing a number of measures to help protect the environment. They\u00a0reduce waste by separating materials and serving drinks in recyclable cups, they save energy by installing solar panels or using LED lighting and they save water by gathering rain water for pitch irrigation and providing water-saving toilet facilities. But\u00a0emissions created by travel to and from the matches\u00a0remain a problem. Traffic jam on the way to the stadium: Many supporters still travel to matches by car Away day emissions According to a study conducted by the climate advisory agency C02OL on behalf of German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk , football fans produce around 7,800 tons of harmful emissions per matchday. It would take\u00a060,000 newly planted trees to compensate for that amount of C02, or over two million per season, and that's before flights to further-flung away games are taken into consideration. In the north of Germany, Bundesliga side Werder Bremen are setting an example with an \"anti-automobile\"\u00a0traffic concept. \"In Bremen, fans can travel to the stadium on a ferry along the River Weser,\"\u00a0explains Fischer. \"What's more, cars are banned from approaching the stadium or from parking there.\" This reduces the amount of C02 being released into the air around the stadium. Fischer is still critical however of clubs such as Mainz and Hoffenheim who bill\u00a0themselves as being \"carbon neutral.\" \"Ultimately, they achieve this by buying climate certificates,\"\u00a0opines Fischer. \u201cIt\u2019s not too far away from the selling of indulgences.\"\u00a0In Hoffenheim's defense, the club compensates for its C02 emissions by running a reforestation program in Uganda in central Africa. \"But that doesn\u2019t solve any waste or emissions problems in Hoffenheim itself,\"\u00a0criticizes Fischer. Panda on the jersey: Freiburg have been working with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature for years Outside engagement Back in Freiburg, the local club is dealing with local problems. SC Freiburg cooperate with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) on nature-protection projects in the Black Forest, the woodland which dominates the region. The project involves regularly educating local children and teenagers about climate change and how they can live more environmentally friendly lives. Club employees are trained as well. Even when, after 25 years of experience, Freiburg are considered an \"industry leader\"\u00a0in environmentally friendly football, there is still much to learn and the club remains open to new ideas. \"More and more organizations and campaigns are getting in touch with us because of our reputation which we have built up since the 1990s,\"\u00a0says Hanno Frenke, who is particularly pleased about the number of young people who approach the club with their own questions and feedback. \"We had the organizers of the Freiburg branch of 'Fridays for Future'\u00a0for a visit, for instance,\"\u00a0he says. \"And of course we supported them \u2013 out of conviction.\" Can football clubs be role models for environmental protection?

{"id": null, "body": "     As nations gathered in Katowice, Poland for the COP24 climate conference, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the event with a warning that the world is losing direction when it comes to climate change. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres officially opened the COP24 summit in Poland with a grim warning, saying that the world is \"way off course\" in its plan to prevent catastrophic climate change.\u00a0 After a string of damning environmental reports showing mankind must drastically slash its greenhouse gas emissions to avert runaway global warming, Guterres told delegates \"we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough\". On Monday, nations that are most threatened by rising sea levels and devastating droughts will use a UN summit to urge richer countries to pay their fair share in the climate change fight. Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, richer nations \u2014\u00a0responsible for the majority of historic greenhouse gas emissions \u2014\u00a0are expected to contribute funding that developing nations can access to make their economies greener. However, US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord has dented trust among vulnerable nations, who fear there is not enough cash available to help them adapt to our heating planet. To ease some of those worries, the World Bank on Monday announced $200 billion (175 billion euros) in climate action investment for 2021-25 \u2014\u00a0a major shot in the arm for green initiatives but one which needs bolstering by state-provided funding. Meanwhile, the presidents of at-risk states such as Fiji, Nigeria and Nepal are expected at COP24 talks, which aim to flesh out the promises agreed to in the 2015 Paris climate accord. However, host country Poland, which is heavily reliant on energy from coal, will push its own agenda: a \"just transition\" from fossil fuels that critics say could allow it to continue polluting for decades. In 2015, the Paris agreement deal saw nations agree to limit global temperature rises to below two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and under 1.5C if possible. Delegates from nearly 200 countries now have two weeks of negotiations to finalize how those goals work in practice, even as science suggests the pace of climate change is rapidly outstripping mankind's response.  The world is losing the battle against climate change \"A failure to act now risks pushing us beyond a point of no return with catastrophic consequences for life as we know it,\" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator at the COP24 for the Alliance of Small Island States. The World Bank website notes that \"In 2017, carbon dioxide levels were the highest they have been in 3-5 million years. According to NASA, 2017 was the second-hottest year globally since 1880. And this is not a one-off. Eighteen of the 19 warmest years on record have happened since 2000.\u00a0 And the UN's own expert climate panel in October issued its starkest warning to date. To have any hope of reaching the 1.5 degree Celsius\u00a0goal by the end of the century, the UN\u00a0said emissions from fossil fuel use must be halved by 2030. While everyone agrees that the problems are real, there is no clear cut path or plan of action to reach the goals enumerated by the UN. Mohamed Adow, climate lead for the Christian Aid charity, said richer nations needed to donate funds to allow developing countries to make the leap to renewables. \"Trudging along the dirty development path trod by richer countries will see developing nations stuck in the past and pollute their environments while ruining efforts to limit global warming,\" he said. Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji and president of last year's COP, said Poland's submission must result in \"a just transition for everyone, especially the most climate vulnerable.\" av/rc\u00a0(AFP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

{"id": null, "body": "     From Sims Eco Lifestyle to Minecraft Climate City, environmental issues are becoming a popular theme in video games. But can the industry deliver on its own green message? Beyond Blue is an adventure video game based on insights from real-life marine scientists Dressed in a futuristic wetsuit that enables her to stay submerged for hours, diver and scientist Mirai is trying to discover secrets of the deep in the Western Pacific.\u00a0 Mirai is the animated protagonist in Beyond Blue, an ocean adventure video game set in the near future. Inspired by the BBC Blue Planet II nature documentary, and using some footage from the British broadcaster, the game is designed to make\u00a0players care about the marine world.\u00a0 Both Mirai and the deep she is exploring are based on insights from three real-life experts active in the field of marine biology, oceanography and ocean exploration.\u00a0\u00a0 Alan Gershenfeld, a co-founder of E-Line Media, the US game publisher and developer behind Beyond Blue, said he wanted to create a strong protagonist who would serve as a role model for players to connect with and look up to. Developers of Beyond Blue aimed to inspire gamers to care about the ocean by exporing its wonders virtually \"The more gamers care about the ocean, the more they want to explore the ocean, avocational or as a career,\"\u00a0he told DW. \"I believe, that's a key step towards ocean preservation.\" According to a UN report , environmental video games like this one might be the next step in raising environmental awareness. Around 2.6 billion people, or one in three across\u00a0the globe, play video games.\u00a0And the industry generates annual revenue of over $140 billion \u00a0(\u20ac116 billion) \u2014 more than Bollywood, Hollywood and recorded music sales combined.\u00a0 One in three people play video games across the globe The report describes the\u00a0reach, creativity and problem-solving ethos of the gaming industry as an \"untapped resource for encouraging engagement in environmental issues.\" While nature has long featured in virtual landscapes, game design is now shifting towards specific environmental issues.\u00a0 In Bee Simulator, for example, players become bees, buzzing through the microworld of their declining population \u2014\u00a0the fate of the family lies on the player's wings when people decide to destroy the tree that holds the hive. The survival game Endling, coming out later this year, is told through the eyes of Earth's last remaining mother fox, trying to protect her cubs in a world destroyed by humans.\u00a0\u00a0 In Bee Simulator players become bees - they collect pollen, take orders from the Queen and have to save the hive's tree that humans want to cut Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle encourages players to change their world with eco-friendly solutions Likewise Minecraft \u2014 which has sold 200 million times in all formats \u2014 has a Climate Hope City map that invites players to explore real-world green solutions like vertical farms and an energy generator that can produce different types of green energy.\u00a0 More recently, Sims, the life simulation game that first emerged in 2000, has released an Eco Lifestyle expansion pack where players can run a clean-water and recycling project or build wind turbines on rooftops to decrease their carbon footprint. True eco-warriors can even go dumpster diving. Alenda Chang, author of the book \"Playing Nature: Ecology in Video Games\"\u00a0says players can learn about the human impact on the environment by\u00a0witnessing different scenarios of how their actions impact their world.\u00a0 \"Games force us to interact with the system, and they produce feelings,\"\u00a0Chang said. \"Players do things and can feel guilty because of their choices. Or they can feel the flash of success when things work out in the game.\" Chang attributes the trend toward\u00a0more eco-based storylines to both the needs of younger players and the priorities of new designers. \"Young people see climate change as something that informs who they are as individuals,\"\u00a0she said. \"Organically what's happening is that this new wave of game designers is bringing these interests with them.\" The virtual environmental experience can, and appears to have already inspired players to be more active in their real lives. When the American software development firm Niantic, Inc\u00a0\u2014 which developed and published Pokemon Go \u2014 called on players to collect waste on Earth Day in 2019, more than 17,000 people in 41 countries showed up. Together, they picked up more than 145 tons of trash.\u00a0 And in China, the Alipay payment app introduced Ant Forest in 2016, a mini-game featuring a virtual tree that grows when users earn points by reducing their CO2 emissions. For each virtual tree, Alipay plants a real one;\u00a0220 million trees have been planted in arid areas in China in five years.\u00a0 In 2019, 21\u00a0companies, including giants like Sony Interactive, Microsoft and Google, formed Playing For The Planet Alliance \u2014 convened by the UN Environment Programme \u2014 to unlock the potential of gaming to tackle environmental issues. \"We want to inspire the gaming community to think what role they can play in tackling the climate crisis,\"\u00a0said Sam Barratt,\u00a0 chief of the Youth, Education and Advocacy Unit in UNEP's Ecosystems Division and co-founder of the alliance. \"We also want to get the industry to hit net-zero emissions as soon as possible.\" Gaming itself generates its own environmental problems, though, whether as\u00a0 e-waste \u00a0or as contributing\u00a0to a country's carbon footprint. It's hard to estimate how much electricity gamers consume since it varies based on how often a gamer plays, what\u00a0platforms they use and how energy efficient their devices are.\u00a0 In 2012, for example, the University of California's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that\u00a0gamers\u00a0 with \u00a0personal \u00a0 computers \u00a0 consumed \u00a0 around \u00a0 75 billion kilowatt-hours \u00a0of electricity \u00a0globally . In a further \u00a0 study ,\u00a0 gamers with\u00a0 a\u00a0 high-end desktop\u00a0 computer\u00a0 and\u00a0 external\u00a0 display were shown to\u00a0 use \u00a0up to 1 250\u00a0 kilowatt-hour \u00a0a year .\u00a0 \u00a0 And when it comes to the world's trash problem, gaming\u00a0consoles in 2019 contributed to the 4.7 million tons of e-waste generated by Small IT products, including mobile phones and personal contributors, or about 9% of the total e-waste generated worldwide, according to the UN's Global E-waste Monitor .\u00a0 Then, there's a question of distribution. While sales of physical copies of games are dropping, another obvious package-free alternative is growing:\u00a0downloads. However, a 2014 study of Play Station 3 in the UK found it to be a more CO2-intensive practice than the use of Blu-ray Discs (BDs). Downloads only have a lower carbon footprint than BDs for games smaller than 1.3 GB while the average size of modern titles is 20 GB. Another rapidly growing option is\u00a0 cloud gaming in which the software is streamed to a smartphone or a laptop, similarly to how video \u00a0and music streaming services work.\u00a0 Game companies will have to look at the whole value chain of products to fulfill their climate commitments But\u00a0this comes with extra pressure on data centers and network infrastructure.\u00a0Lancaster University in northern England estimated \u00a0that if gamers moved to streaming by 2030, carbon emissions could increase by 30%.

{"id": null, "body": "     The warming effect of greenhouse gases has increased 41 percent since 1990, according to the UN's weather organization. It said the window of opportunity to act against climate change \"is almost closed.\" The levels of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere rose to a new record high last year, the UN's weather organization said on Thursday. According to the World Meteorological Organization's\u00a0(WMO) Greenhouse Gas Bulletin , there is also no sign of a\u00a0reversal of this trend. The organization said the increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are a driving force for long-term climate change, rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Since 1990, the WMO has recorded a 41 percent increase in the warming effect\u00a0of greenhouse gases. The increase in CO2, the main long-lived greenhouse in the atmosphere, is caused by human activities like burning coal and other fossil fuels. The global average concentrations of carbon dioxide reached 405.5 parts per million in 2017, an increase both from 2016 and 2015. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement that the window of opportunity\u00a0to stop climate change \"is almost closed.\" \"The science is clear. Without rapid cuts in CO2\u00a0and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth,\" he said. Each year, the Global Footprint Network \u2014 an international think tank with more than 90 partner organizations \u2014 calculates the so-called Earth Overshoot Day. This marks the date when we have used as much from nature as our planet can renew over the whole year. Think of it as a bank account with a certain budget for the year. Starting on August 1, 2018, humanity is in the red. Today, all of humanity consumes resources equivalent to 1.7 planet Earths. Needless to say, there are big regional differences: If all of mankind lived and did business like Germans, we would need more than 3 planets; the American way of life would require 4.9 planets. Burning fossil fuels and wood makes up 60 percent of our ecological footprint. In absolute terms, China, the United States, the European Union and India are the world's largest CO2 emitters. Per capita consumption, however, puts those figures into perspective. Trees provide timber, an invaluable raw material for items such as paper. But they also prevent soil erosion, help replenish the groundwater and are indispensable in climatic cycles, including as CO2 reservoirs. In Germany for example, forested area binds a mere 15 percent of the country's annual CO2 emissions. Nonetheless, 3.3 million hectares of forest are lost worldwide each year. Humanity is growing. New crop areas are sprouting up everywhere \u2014 and at the same time, the world is losing farmland to urban development, soil erosion and soil degradation. At the moment, each EU citizen uses an average of 0.31 hectares of farmland for the food they consume. But if resources were distributed equitably worldwide, everyone would be entitled to only 0.2 hectares. As we catch ever more fish, stocks are not able to recover adequately. By now, almost a third of the world's fish stocks are considered overfished, and far more than half exploited to their maximum. CO2 emissions are also acidifying the oceans, resulting in ever more difficult living conditions for marine creatures. The United Nations Environment Program estimates that almost half of the world's population will suffer from water shortages by 2030. Groundwater reserves are becoming increasingly scarce, and are often contaminated. The level of pollution in from farming and household waste in rivers, lakes and other bodies of water is in some places so high that this water is not even suitable for animals. In mathematical terms, every human would have 1.8 hectares at his or her disposal in order to satisfy basic survival needs in an ecologically sustainable fashion. But the average German, for example, consumes the equivalent of 5.1 hectares. In 2018, Germany already exhausted its bio-capacity on May 2 \u2014 and has since been living at the expense of other countries or future generations. Author: Helle Jeppesen The data released by the WMO comes after an October report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which showed that net CO2 emissions must reach zero around 2050 in order to limit temperature increases. A temperature increase of under\u00a01.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) would reduce the consequences of global warming for humans and ecosystems. Both the\u00a0reports will\u00a0be the foundation for the UN climate change negotiations, which will take place in Katowice, Poland from December 2-14. The negotiations aim to set down the guidelines for the implementation of the Paris Climate Change agreement, which aims to keep the global temperature increase as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. \"There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2\u00a0from the atmosphere,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova in a statement. \"Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases.\" New research suggests that unless we rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions we will have to extract far more CO2 from the atmosphere than we are technically prepared for. (29.03.2018)\n\u00a0 The European Parliament has proposed even tougher 2030 targets for car and van emissions than advocated by the Commission. Manufacturers whose fleets exceed the average goal would pay fines to fund re-training. (03.10.2018)\n\u00a0 There's only so much greenhouse gas we can emit before global temperature rise exceeds 2 degrees \u2014 the so-called carbon budget. And Germany will blow its share of the budget if it doesn't quit coal soon, experts warn.

{"id": null, "body": "     After four bad years for US green policies, Joe Biden has made the most ambitious promises on climate protection of any American president to date. But can they be achieved? Joe Biden has made some bold climate pledges The past\u00a0years have been a troubled time for the United States in matters of\u00a0climate protection policy. President Donald Trump repeatedly denied the science on climate change, and his 2017 plan to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement came into effect the day after the US presidential election in November 2020. Joe Biden has pledged that his inauguration would mark a sea change for climate policy. The Democratic Party can expect to have effective control of both houses of the US Congress from January 20, allowing him more power to push his climate agenda. But what has he promised \u2014 and can he make it happen? Matching the goal of the European Union and many other large global emitters, Biden has pledged to make the US climate-neutral by 2050 or earlier \u2014 something the environmental economist Nat Keohane describes as a \"huge step.\" Keohane serves as the senior vice president for climate with the US-based global NGO the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).\u00a0 \"We are on the cusp of having the world's main three emitters \u2014 the EU, China and now the US \u2014 having made either climate-neutral or carbon-neutral pledges by 2050 and 2060,\" Keohane said. Climate neutrality refers to net-zero emissions of all greenhouse gases; and carbon-neutrality specifically refers to net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. The 2050 goal by the US would bring it into line with many other big emitters Though much of Biden's plan to reach this remains a closely guarded secret, Keohane believes that a 50% cut in emissions over 2005 levels by 2030 should be the new administration's first goal. Christoph Bertram, a German scientist who leads international climate policy analysis in the Energy Systems Group at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), regards the 2050 target as a positive \"signal.\" \"But, for a long-term target like this, there is no single action you could take today that would ensure this goal,\" Bertram said. \"For political purposes it is important to signal to fellow policymakers and other parts of society that you have a clear long-term vision of where things have to go.\" Fracking for natural gas releases harmful pollutants and emissions Biden will need to satisfy workers in states where fracking is a major employer With 2050 a long way off, all eyes are on what Biden does at home in the next few years. Key among his domestic climate pledges is his plan to make the US power sector climate neutral by 2035. Bertram said \"this is something where there could be visible results within three to four years [in Biden's term].\" In addition to the power sector, Keohane said, the EDF has identified two other key short-term goals for Biden's domestic policy: transportation, particularly with legislation around tailpipe standards for cars and trucks, and methane reduction in industry. \"The federal government needs to go all out on existing authorities like the Clean Air Act,\" Keohane said. \"Methane is the main cause of near-term warming, and reducing that is something Biden can do from day one.\" In the US, the oil and gas industries were responsible for 31% of methane production in the US between 1990 and 2017,\u00a0 according to the Environmental Protection Agency \u00a0\u2014 second only to agriculture. Investing in clean energy sources and creating a transition away from these industries will be important in reducing methane emissions in the next few years. Deb Haaland, Biden's pick for Secretary of the Interior, is a proponent of swift action to combat climate change Joe Biden has appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry to the role of special envoy on climate Biden has promised to rejoin the Paris Agreement \"immediately\" upon taking office. The 2015 treaty sets out a framework for countries to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) above preindustrial levels. \"The Paris Agreement is very peculiar: It has common long-term targets, but the mechanism gives a lot of autonomy to nation states by allowing them to determine their own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),\" Bertram said. These NDCs have to be laid out every five years. The US will need to issue its latest NDCs by November this year, ahead of the UN climate conference, COP26. Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Climate and Energy Program of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a US-based nonprofit science advocacy organization, described Trump's pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement as \"very shameful.\"\u00a0She said the US's new NDC would have to show a willingness to commit. \"It's not enough to just rejoin, [the US] needs to rejoin with clear ambitions on cutting our heat-trapping emissions, as well as providing climate finance to developing countries \u2014 in line with our fair share contribution,\" Cleetus said. Under Trump, the US slipped in rankings for climate performance After four years of \"America First,\" Biden has pledged to \"rally the rest of the world to meet the threat of climate change.\"\u00a0 Although there is now a big international trust deficit, there is always a leadership role for the\u00a0United States, said Keohane, who also worked as a special assistant for energy and environment under President Barack Obama. Keohane said the United States \"needs to start walking the walk at home\" with domestic policies. \"This is something we can act on relatively quickly,\" he said. Cleetus said the Biden administration would have to do a lot more than \"trot out the tired rhetoric\" about US leadership.\u00a0 \"What the world needs from the US is not rhetoric but action,\" she said. \"We need to take our place at the table, and do our part responsibly, fairly and quickly.\" Bertram said it was \"realistic\" that the United\u00a0States could take on a leadership role in climate protection, pointing out that, despite a dearth of federal engagement in climate policies under Trump, many states have pushed ahead with technological innovation and environment policies. \"Some US states see their role as being one of global technological pioneers, and there has been a lot of climate technological progress in the last four years,\" he said, giving examples of innovations in electric transportation and renewable energy. Biden's ambitious plans offer the opportunity for the country to go a lot further. How they progress will be of great interest to many. \"We'll be watching closely what he does in his first hundred\u00a0days, and even on day one,\" Rachel Cleetus added. \"That will make all the difference.\" After years of drought followed by torrential rains, East Africa is devastated by the biggest swarm of locusts in decades. Billions of the ravenous insects devour crops in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, spreading to southern Africa, Yemen and India in later months. Climate scientists say heavy rains and warmer temperatures linked to climate change are to blame for \"exceptional\" breeding conditions. A long bushfire season comes to an end after more than six months. Thirty-three people and 3 billion animals are dead, hurt or displaced, and an area the size of South Korea has been devastated. Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejects a direct link between greenhouse gas emissions and the severity of the fires; Australia is one of the world's highest per capita emitters of carbon dioxide. With more than half the global population under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global greenhouse gas emissions slow. Skies above industrial centers in China, Italy and elsewhere clear as airlines slash flights, factories shut down and city streets empty out. But as lockdowns ease and people find ways to live with the pandemic, experts warn emissions may rebound. As researchers race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, world leaders struggle to deal with the economic fallout of the pandemic. Chancellor Angela Merkel announces that Germany plans to make climate-friendly investment a priority in its recovery plans and urges global decision-makers to do the same. Meanwhile, activists keep up the pressure with protests, both virtual and physically distanced. The first pandemic wave begins to ebb and people \u2014 some cooped up for weeks \u2014 begin to venture outdoors. To help maintain physical distancing and keep traffic jams and public transport crowds from getting out of control, many cities introduce temporary or permanent measures to improve urban mobility. Bogota, Colombia (above) adds more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) of emergency bike lanes. The ongoing pandemic isn't just a health disaster. Use of disposable face masks, gloves and other plastic products has skyrocketed, contributing to a growing waste problem. In a related attempt to clean up the mess and move away from a \"throw-away culture,\" Germany falls in line with the EU and decides to ban plastic cutlery, straws, food containers and other single-use products as of July 2021. Early in the summer, Russia declares a state of emergency after some 21,000 tons of diesel fuel are leaked, contaminating local rivers and soil in Siberia. The disaster is followed by uncontrolled wildfires across the region, one of the world's coldest. Smoldering permafrost and burning brush release more than half a billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere the following months. Back-to-back hurricanes in the Caribbean; raging wildfires in the Amazon rainforest; historic floods in Southeast Asia: The increasingly devastating effects of climate change make themselves known. Hurricane Laura, which caused intense flooding in the Dominican Republic and Haiti (above), claims dozens of lives there and in the US. Pakistan, meanwhile, sees its worst flooding since 1931. As China makes an unexpected announcement to become climate neutral by 2060, wildfires rage across the US west coast, casting an ominous orange glow over San Francisco and the Bay Area. The fires scorch the states of Oregon, Washington and California for months. Overall, fires in the US claimed an estimated 4,177,856 acres (1,690,718 hectares) of land in 2020, more than half the size of Belgium. Conservation groups reveal that the Tasmanian devil has made an appearance on the Australian mainland for the first time in 3,000 years. The \"historic\" release of the carnivorous marsupials into a sanctuary north of Sydney will give the endangered species the chance to rebuild a self-sustaining wild population. It's estimated that fewer than 25,000 devils still live in the wild. The US officially leaves the Paris Agreement \u2014 a day after the decisive win of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the presidential election. Biden pledges to rejoin the international climate accord when he takes office in January and announces ambitious plans \u2014 and trillions in funding \u2014 to help wean the US energy sector off fossil fuels over the next 15 years and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. As the world marks five years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, the EU ups its green credentials. After months of tough negotiations, and a prior endorsement by the European Parliament, the 27 member states agree to a binding target to cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels \u2014 up from 40%. Campaigners welcome the move but say much more still needs to be done. Author: Martin Kuebler US president-elect Joe Biden has chosen a seasoned diplomat to spearhead his climate policy.

{"id": null, "body": "     How can you beat climate change with only half the world's population? Gender was among the main side-topics at the UN climate summit in Bonn. DW spoke to women who intend to be part of the solution to climate change. \"I'm the only woman here,\" noted Celestine Ketcha Courtes, mayor of a small town in Cameroon, looking to her left and right on the podium at a press conference of mayors on local climate action at the UN climate talks . Although she is laughing, she means business. Although the United Nations climate change secretariat (UNFCCC) is led by a woman for the second time in a row \u2014 current Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa , who followed Christiana Figueres \u2014 women are still vastly absent from climate change decision-making. And largely\u00a0ignored by climate policies. Only one out of three delegates at the last two climate conferences were women, according to a recent paper from the UNFCCC . To bolster the\u00a0role of women in climate change action, delegates have adopted the first\u00a0 Gender Action Plan \u00a0at the 23rd \"conference of the parties,\" which took place from November 6 to 17 in Bonn. Women\u00a0activists and researchers hailed adoption of the plan. UNFCCC Chief Christina Espinosa says women must be at the forefront of climate change action \"The issue of gender equality, women's rights and empowerment has really seen an increasing recognition \u2014 and that's very positive,\" Verona Collantes, intergovernmental specialist at UN Women, told DW. \"Without gender justice, world leaders won't create successful climate policies because half of the population will be left behind,\" she said. It's not the first time the international community has discussed how climate change\u00a0and gender equality\u00a0are connected \u2014 but it is the first time they have agreed upon a set of specific activities, indicated who\u00a0the responsible actors are, and set a timeline for implementation, she explains. In two years, delegates from the national governments will report back on the progress that has been made on gender justice. Women more vulnerable Climate change is affecting everyone living on this planet. But women in particular will feel its\u00a0impact, experts say. That's because climate change exacerbates existing gender inequality. \"Women are not starting from an even playing field \u2014 economically, socially and politically. They are more vulnerable because of these constructs,\" Gotelind Alber, co-founder of the nongovernmental organization GenderCC-Women for Climate Justice, told DW. The majority of the world's poor are women, meaning they have fewer resources to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Women are also more dependent on natural resources for their livelihood. In developing countries, women are responsible for 60 to 80 percent of all household food production, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. When drought\u00a0or floods destroy the harvest, women and girls are often the first to reduce how much they eat \u2014 sacrificing their diet for the well-being of the rest of the family,\u00a0Lim Hwei Mian, from the Asian-pacific resource and\u00a0research centre for women (ARROW), said. Women are more affected by climate change due in part to their close relation to managing food resources in the household Add to that how in rural areas in many developing countries, it's women's duty to collect water. According to data from the UN , the combined hours of all women in sub-Saharan Africa fetching water is 16 million hours. Men, in comparison, spend 6 million hours on water collection. With droughts becoming more frequent,\u00a0women and girls would need to walk longer distances to collect water. This means they will\u00a0lose\u00a0valuable time to go to school, and face an even-greater\u00a0risk of sexual harrassment or even assault at dusk or dawn, Lim Hwei Mian explained. Women and girls are also more vulnerable to storms, floods and cyclones. According to a\u00a0 UN Population Fund report , they are 14 times more likely to die than men during natural disasters. \"Girls are not taught to swim or to climb a tree \u2014 girls are not taught to be tough, so they are less prepared when natural disasters hit their communities,\" Mian told DW. 'Not just victims' But many women counter that they are not\u00a0victims \u2014 they are the solution. They can act as local agents of change, says Osprey Orielle Lake, executive director of Women's Earth and Climate Action Network. \"Although women are impacted first and worst by climate change, they say,\u00a0'we are not victims, we are the solution' \u2014 and they are absolutely right,\" Lake told DW. Women have local knowledge of natural resources, and are often responsible for managing sustainable usage of those resources at home or in their community. As a result, many women are already leading climate action on the ground, and in doing so are aiding the global fight against climate change. Tali Layango Arista (on the right) and her two colleagues are leading local climate protection projects at home in Peru Take\u00a0for example\u00a0Tali Layango Arista, an indigenous woman from Peru. She is leading a reforestation project with her fellow female community members.\u00a0 \"When we trade with wood within our communities, we reforest\u00a0the cleared area afterwards,\" Arista told DW. Women are often \"in direct contact with our forests and environment,\" she added. Women are not only more likely to protect the environment on a local level, but also on a regional and national level. Studies have shown that when women are in leading political positions, climate laws are more easily passed. Cameroonian mayor Courtes is one of many examples of women\u00a0in leadership positions, and their positive impact on the environment. In 2014, she received the United Nations Public Service Award for providing potable water to all inhabitants of her city. The project was made possible by involving female residents, who manage consumption of water and other resources. \"I'm calling on the support of women because they\u00a0are at the center of managing everything that is about climate change,\" Courtes affirmed. Samuel is only 10 years old, but when it comes to describing how climate change will impact our planet, he has a clear answer: water will rise so much that people living near the sea will be begging for help to survive. But why does it happen? \"Because of the extreme pollution,\" he says. While Daniel (7) loves contemplating the sun, he wonders whether it will still be here in 50 years. He is hoping it only changes slightly, and that sunsets and sunrises will still be beautiful and colorful and will keep delighting adults and children. He's already urging his parents to recycle at home. After all, it's his future that's at stake. In a near future, flying cars will still be as polluting as cars nowadays, the sky will rarely look blue due to pollution, and humankind will completely forget the importance of nature - even the last of the trees will be removed. To top it off, droughts will be so bad in some places that ships will be stranded. And for that, Paloma (10) points out, we don't need to wait 50 years but only 15. Emma (7) has been traveling through southeast Asia in recent months and has loved the experience. But it was so hot! She learned from her mom that global temperatures are increasing every year. Therefore it's not surprising how she imagines the planet in the future: the sun will almost burn out and people will be forced to leave Earth \u2013 in rockets, of course. Life on another planet is exactly what Linus (12) imagines - more concretely, on Mars. In 50 years, the Earth will be immersed in such chaos that we will have to look for a better place. But even there, we will not have learned the lesson and we will leave another trail of consumption and destruction. Not much hope for our near future, right, Linus? \"Well, we can still stop it!\" In place of nature, technology will dominate our daily lives, Yann (12) believes. But for him, this is not discouraging, since we will have the most advanced technologies and lots of flying objects. This is how our planet will look in 50 years: a futuristic cityscape filled with revolutionary machines. Astrid (6) has a very abstract idea about Earth. It's a place where river flows, air flows and people are simultaneously affected by the same threat: a gigantic carbon \"handprint.\" Astrid has heard about it at school: the bigger the \"handprint,\" the worse the impact for us all. Our young artists don't always want to give a clear interpretation for their pieces. In this case, Miguel (10) provides us with two main options: The robot represents destructive climate change. Here, our destiny is quite clear. On the other hand, it may just mean that artificial intelligence will get out of control and become more powerful than humans. In any case, it's our time to act! At 7, Judith gets quite serious when talking about the future, and is convinced we might all be dead by 2067 - pets included. In half a century, almost no one will have survived planetary destruction: and aliens will get the chance to take over. Just in case, Judith already prefers to save precious resources.

Infectious diseases have emerged as the top global risk in terms of impact in this year's Global Risks Report The scars of the COVID-19 pandemic will be\u00a0visible\u00a0for years with many of them manifesting into some of the most critical threats to the world, according to a new report by the World Economic Forum (WEF). A survey that forms the basis of this year's Global Risks Report has revealed\u00a0 mass unemployment , digital inequality and prolonged economic stagnation as some of the risks that could pose a danger in the next two years. The coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 2\u00a0million lives globally, has pushed the global economy into its worst recession since World War II, rendering millions of people jobless and pushing many more into poverty. \"Job losses, a widening digital divide, disrupted social interactions, and abrupt shifts in markets could lead to dire consequences and lost opportunities for large parts of the global population,\" said the report. \"The ramifications \u2014 in the form of social unrest, political fragmentation and geopolitical tensions \u2014 will shape the effectiveness of our responses to the other key threats of the next decade: cyberattacks, weapons of mass destruction and, most notably, climate change.\" The pandemic led to one of the swiftest organizational transformations in history as governments and businesses went digital to minimize the disruption caused by lockdowns. The restrictions spurred an unprecedented adoption of digital technologies\u00a0as\u00a0 people were asked to work from home, schools and universities took their classes online, doctors and patients turned to telemedicine and political leaders switched to virtual summits.\u00a0 But the increasing reliance on the internet has exposed the deep divide between the technology haves and have-nots both within countries and between countries, with many children unable to attend online classes because of poor internet access and businesses shutting down over of their inability to go digital. \"The elder part of the millennials those who are now in their mid-30s, they have essentially lived through two crises. They have seen the global financial crisis of 2008-09 when they first joined the workforce and now they are seeing the recession of today. So, for them their working lives have been bookended by these two crises,\" Saadia Zahidi, managing director of the World Economic Forum, told DW. \"Even for the younger cohort of millennials and Gen Z, there is the environmental crisis. They have seen the environmental catastrophe unfold before them. So\u00a0they are also facing this double disruption,\" she said. \"They would need additional support because this is the generation that will be scarred by this crisis and they will go on to vote and shape our economies and societies for the next 30-40 years.\" The survey of more than\u00a0650\u00a0WEF\u00a0members from business, government\u00a0and academia\u00a0found that the risk of \"youth disillusionment\" was being largely neglected by the global community, but said it would become a critical threat to the world in the short term. \"Hard-fought societal wins could be obliterated if the current generation lacks adequate pathways to future opportunities \u2014 and loses faith in today's economic and political institutions,\" the report warned. Climate change once again emerged as a catastrophic risk in the annual report, with \"climate action failure\" and \"extreme weather\" identified as most likely long-term risks for the third straight year. Global lockdowns led to a drop in global emissions \u00a0last year, but they could not prevent 2020 from going down as the hottest year on record. A sharp economic recovery and an easing of restrictions later this year could lead to emissions bouncing back. \"The biggest long-term risk remains a failure to act on climate change. There is no vaccine against climate risks, so post-pandemic recovery plans must focus on growth aligning with sustainability agendas to build back better,\" said\u00a0Peter Giger from the Zurich Insurance Group. The report noted\u00a0that responses to the current pandemic, which have caused new \"domestic and geopolitical tensions that threaten stability,\" could undermine the global fight against climate change. Survey respondents rated \"multilateralism collapse\" as a critical long-term threat. Equity investors, known for their myopic views, have been eternal procrastinators when it comes to climate risks. Tesla's meteoric rise shows that they may be finally smelling the coffee, says DW's Ashutosh Pandey. \u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Pandemic, climate change threaten global stability: WEF", "article_name": "world-stability-at-risk-pandemic-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/world-stability-at-risk-pandemic-climate-change/a-56265470", "date_published": "2021-01-19 00:00:00", "article_length": 4826, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:02:57.347781"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Australia, a major coal exporter and one of the worst per capita emitters, goes to the polls Saturday. The result could be decisive for global climate goals, as voters demand lawmakers do more to cut emissions. Australians are already dealing with hellish wildfires, worsened by climate change The results of the Australian election this Saturday will set the climate agenda for one of the planet's worst per-capita CO2 emitters. It comes\u00a0as the world faces a rapidly closing window to stop the most severe impacts\u00a0of climate change. The country, dubbed a \"wrecker\" at climate change negotiations,\u00a0is a major exporter of fossil fuels, largely to East Asia and India. It\u00a0has been criticized\u00a0for grossly insufficient climate targets by the UK and US as well as its neighboring Pacific nations who could see their homes disappear as sea levels rise. Australians want action on climate change, but major parties have hardly mentioned the issue in their election campaigns At the same time, polls clearly show voters back stronger climate action in the \"sunburned land,\" having already experienced deadly and costly flooding and wildfires linked to climate change in recent years. Some big businesses, once against emissions cuts,\u00a0have also done a U-turn on climate policy. The country is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. \"Australians are feeling and seeing climate damage now and that's why most Australians are very worried about climate change and want the government to do a lot more than they are,\" said Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF). Despite public support, the major parties vying for votes in the tight election have barely mentioned the issue in their campaigns, said Peter Christoff, senior research fellow with Melbourne Climate Futures, which is part of the University of Melbourne. \"And that's really quite concerning and worrying,\" said Christoff. Wildfires in 2021: Australians are already feeling the effects of the climate crisis Since 2007, Australia's two major parties, the center-left Labor Party and the conservative Liberal Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison, have been in an open war over climate change policies, leading to multiple leaders being toppled. \"The public vitriol in political exchanges \u2014 particularly over an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon and carbon taxes \u2014 led to some of the ugliest politics we've seen in Australia over a 15-year period,\" said Christoff. Labor believes it lost the supposedly unlosable \"climate election\" in 2019 to the Liberals because of a backlash against its strong climate policies and job fears in key seats in coal-mining areas. Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter. And because of\u00a0the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising coal prices mean Australia will likely earn 100 billion Australian dollars (\u20ac67\u00a0billion, $70\u00a0billion) in one year from coal. Meanwhile, between 100,000 and 300,000 Australian jobs connected to coal, oil and gas are at risk if the country doesn't prepare for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to a study by independent Australian think tank, the Centre for Policy Development. To date, the conservatives\u00a0have stymied significant action on climate change \u2014 blocking a major emissions trading scheme,\u00a0 slashing funding on climate research, \u00a0subsidizing and allowing fossil fuel production to expand and abolishing the government-funded Climate Commission. At the 2021\u00a0UN climate conference in Glasgow, the government refused to budge from its 2030 emission cuts of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels \u2014\u00a0one of the weakest targets in the developed world. The UN Climate Action Tracker rates Australia's emissions and net-zero targets as \"poor\" and \"highly insufficient,\" putting it on a path to\u00a0more than 3 degrees Celsius warming. Going into the 2022 election, the Liberal Party\u00a0 pledged to go net-zero by 2050 , but has given itself scope to ignore this . At the same time, it has vowed to continue exports of Australia's coal and gas past 2050 and has included these fossil fuels in its domestic energy blueprint. Labor \u2014 currently forecast to win this election \u2014 has also vowed to go net-zero by 2050 and has stronger emission cuts of 43% by 2030 . It has\u00a0pledged tens of billions of dollars to revitalize the nation's energy grid and install solar banks and batteries. But it\u00a0says it won't stop exporting coal and gas. The Australian Green Party, as well as climate-minded independents, are seeing a surge in support Australia is dominated by two main parties, but by dragging their heels on climate change Labor and the Liberals have opened the door to new challengers. A group of independents, dubbed \"the teals,\" are competing with Liberal lawmakers\u00a0for urban seats. Mostly women, they\u00a0receive funding from a group called Climate 200 \u2014 a relatively new political fund\u00a0established by clean energy investor Simon Holmes a Court \u2014 and have campaigned on climate, integrity, and gender equality. They have all set ambitious 2030 emission reduction targets ranging from 50% to 70% by 2030. And they appear to be attracting moderate Liberal voters who have become disillusioned with a lack of movement on climate change. Most recent polling shows several key seats are at risk. Meanwhile, the Greens\u00a0have enjoyed a surge and are now polling at about 15% nationally \u2014 compared to 10% in the 2019 election. They have pledged to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 , go net-zero by 2035, phase out the mining, burning and exporting of coal by 2030 and convert the grid to 100% renewables. Depending on the result of the election, both the Greens and the teal candidates could wield significant power over the government. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg may lose his seat to a climate-friendly independent Businesses are also calling for more action. In one\u00a0example, Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes is attempting to use his wealth to force energy giant AGL to exit coal-fired power generation. Even the Business Council of Australia \u2014\u00a0which represents big\u00a0banks and corporations, such as industrial and retail giant Wesfarmers, mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto and airline Qantas\u00a0\u2014 is now also calling for major emission cuts by 2030. It's a dramatic shift for the organization that in 2018 called 45% emissions reduction cuts \"an economy wrecking target.\" \"It's certainly not the community that is holding back the Australian political parties on climate action and also not the business community,\" ACF's O'Shanassy said. \"Everyone wants climate action except for the people that go to Parliament House.\" But neither Labor nor the Liberals' targets are enough to bring Australia in line with its Paris Commitments. Emissions cuts of at least 50% by 2030 are what's required to keep it below the upper threshold of 2 degrees warming and about 75% for the 1.5-degree target, according to some estimates. ACF believes\u00a0 the next government should\u00a0take advantage of the country's\u00a0huge solar and wind potential and could quickly cut\u00a0emissions while preserving jobs by replacing fossil fuel\u00a0exports with products created with renewable energy such as hydrogen and ammonia. \"We need to use the vast amount of renewable energy we have in this country. We need to times it by about ten and then turn that into exports and stop exporting pollution to the world,\" O'Shanassy said. \"That would be our greatest contribution to climate change.\" Many countries around the world banned the usual New Year's fireworks to relieve pressure on hospitals swamped with COVID-19 cases. For Germany, that meant an estimated 3,500 tons of plastic waste saved. In Amsterdam, the taboo on home pyrotechnics looks set to endure, with the city organizing public displays instead. Europe and North America saw plunging temperatures, with many regions blanketed in deep snow. Arctic warming caused dips in the polar vortex and a weaker jet stream, conspiring to send chilly Arctic air south. Disruption of the jet stream can also have the reverse effect, sending warm air up from the tropics. We're yet to see which trend will dominate as the planet continues to heat up. Thousands of people had to leave their homes after heavy rain flooded towns in eastern Australia. Gladys Berejiklian, then the premier of New South Wales, a state that was particularly affected, called the inundation a \"one-in-100-year event.\" Some commentators argued that this kind of flooding is in fact becoming the new normal. Europe's biggest economy was given a reality check by its Constitutional Court, which declared the German Climate Protection Act unconstitutional for failing to include climate targets beyond 2030. The court said this would place too great a burden on future generations. The Bundestag toughened up the legislation with a commitment to go climate-neutral by 2045. In another landmark ruling, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered Shell to cut its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was the first time a private company has been legally forced to comply with the global agreement. \"This applies to the entire world, so also to Shell,\" the judge said. More than 230 people died during a heat wave in Canada, with record temperatures of nearly 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) recorded in Lytton, British Columbia. The following day, forest fires reduced much of the village to ash. This was also a summer of devastating blazes for California, Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey, and Siberia and the Amazon. In Central Europe, catastrophic heavy rain turned streams into raging rivers that inundated towns and villages as they burst their banks. In Germany's Rhineland, more than 180 people lost their lives. Parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also suffered extreme floods. Property damage in Germany alone was estimated at several billion euros. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report with an unequivocal message: The climate crisis is worse than we thought and humans are definitely to blame. The IPCC's assessment reports are the most detailed and comprehensive on the topic, in this case drawing on more than 14,000 peer-reviewed studies. At the UN General Assembly, Premier Xi Jinping announced that China would no longer build coal-fired power plants abroad \u2014 putting an end to a construction spree that has already seen hundreds of Chinese-backed coal power projects go up as part of its Belt and Road Initiative through Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. But Beijing continues to build new coal power plants at home. Concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere reached a new record in 2020. According to the report by the World Meteorological Organization, the year-on-year increase was higher than the average increase over the past decade, despite the economic fallout of the pandemic. The WMO announced the figures with the warning that \"we are way off track\" for the Paris Agreement targets. After a pandemic hiatus, the UN Climate Change Conference was back in 2021, but it struggled to decide the details of the Glasgow Climate Pact. With India and China resisting a commitment to phase out coal, the final text agreed only to a \"phasedown.\" For many, this was hugely disappointing, though not necessarily surprising. Greta Thunberg had already declared COP26 \"a global greenwash festival.\" With the year drawing to a close, the US was hit by more extreme weather as 36 tornadoes swept through six states and left devastation in their wake. Homes and businesses were demolished, while dozens of people were killed. President Biden announced an investigation into global heating's impact on the tornadoes. Soonafter, nearly 400 people died in the Philippines after Typhoon Rai hit.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate-related catastrophes like floods and forest fires are driving millions of people from their homes every year, said anti-poverty NGO Oxfam. While no one is immune, people in poor countries are most at risk. Over the past decade, climate-fuelled disasters drove over 20 million people a year from their homes, concluded a report released by Oxfam on Monday. The Oxfam study, titled \"Forced from Home,\" \u00a0was released as two weeks of UN climate negotiations kick-start in Madrid.\u00a0\u00a0 It examined the numbers of people displaced inside their home countries by climate-fuelled disasters between 2008 and 2018, based on government and international agency data, as well as media reports. \"Today people are seven times more likely to be internally displaced by cyclones, floods and wildfires as they are by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and three times more likely than by conflict,\"\u00a0the report said. \u00a0 While no one is immune, people in poor countries are most at risk , the NGO said. \"People in low and lower-middle income countries such as India, Nigeria and Bolivia are over four times more likely to be displaced by extreme weather disasters than people in rich countries such as the United States.\" Seven of the top 10 countries with the highest displacement by proportion of their population were small island developing states, largely in the Pacific and the Caribbean, the report found. Asia is the continent most affected, said Oxfam, noting that around 80% of all people displaced over the last decade live there. \"Our governments are fuelling a crisis that is driving millions of women, men and children from their homes and the poorest people in the poorest countries are paying the heaviest price,\"\u00a0said Chema Vera, Acting Executive Director of Oxfam International. The summer of 2019 saw heat records in Europe broken across the continent. In July, Germany recorded its highest temperature ever at 42.6 C (108 F). France broke its heat record twice in 2019, the highest temperature measuring 46.C (114.8 F) in July. Climate change increases the frequency of heat waves. In November 2019, the Italian archipelago city of Venice experienced multiple flooding events and the high water mark of 1.5 meters was reached three times in one week for the first time in recorded history. Projected sea level rise due to climate change could make these events more likely in the future. The same heat wave that brought record temperatures to France sparked the worst wildfires to hit Spain in 20 years. On the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, wildfires in August decimated a national park on the popular tourist island. Hotter temperatures and drier air due to climate change increase the risk of fires. A combination of drought, storms and extreme heat is depleting Germany's forests. According to BDF, a forest advocacy group, in Germany, more than 1 million established trees have died since 2018. \"These are no longer single unusual weather events. That is climate change,\" said a BDF representative. A glacier on the Italian side of Mont Blanc experienced accelerated melting in 2019. And enthusiasts held a \"funeral\" for the Pizol glacier in the Swiss Alps, which has almost completely disappeared. Scientists say climate change accelerates glacial melting in the Alps. Two consecutive years of drought in Germany have hit farmers hard. In 2018, record drought caused major crop failures, and heat waves in 2019 also damaged crops. \"Climate change means more frequent droughts and extreme weather events in Germany,\"said German Weather Service Vice President Paul Becker. Costs rising quickly Overall, the number of weather disasters considered extreme grew five-fold over the last decade, researchers said. As more people leave their homes as a result of weather disasters, costs \u2014 and threats to social stability \u2014 are rising quickly for the countries trying to manage that displacement, often with few resources, the report said. At the UN climate talks in Madrid, environmental and development groups are pushing to establish a fund to help countries already reeling from climate-enhanced heat waves, droughts, floods and storms made worse by wilder weather and rising seas. Poor and vulnerable nations are set to receive $100 billion (\u20ac90.7 billion) annually from next year to prepare for future impacts, but no concrete provisions exist yet for \"loss and damage\" already incurred. sri/rt (Reuters, AFP) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

{"id": null, "body": "     A\u00a0Dutch court has ordered\u00a0Shell to bring its emissions in line with the Paris climate targets. Claimants had argued that Shell had violated human rights by fueling the climate crisis. Shell was taken to court for fueling 'dangerous' climate change A landmark judgment in The Hague has ruled that the oil giant Shell and its suppliers must cut emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels, as mandated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \u00a0 The court found Shell's current commitment to\u00a0reduce\u00a0emissions intensity by\u00a020% by 2030 was insufficient.\u00a0Claimants had argued the\u00a0reduction would come\u00a0too late to meet the Paris target of limiting global heating to 1.5 degree\u00a0Celsius (2.7 F) by the end of the century. \u00a0 In the words of the court, Shell\u00a0should follow the \"worldwide agreement\"\u00a0that\u00a0a\u00a045% net reduction in 2030\u00a0is necessary to limit global heating. \"This applies to the entire world, so also to Shell,\" the judge said. The ruling is effective immediately. \"This means they have to keep fossil fuels in the ground as of today,\" said climate group\u00a0Parents For Future in a Tweet. After arguments were heard during four days of hearings \u00a0in December, the much-anticipated decision\u00a0paves the way for a wave of litigation against Big Oil companies. The case is an important precedent in that a company \u2014 and not a state \u2014 must now abide by the Paris targets.\u00a0 \"So far it has been impossible to hold corporations accountable,\" said Peer de Rijk, senior policy officer at Friends of the Earth Netherlands\u00a0(Milieudefensie),\u00a0which initiated the summons against Shell. \"This will have enormous consequences.\" Roger Cox, lawyer for Friends of the Earth Netherlands, called the ruling\u00a0\"a\u00a0turning point in history. This case is unique because it is the first time a judge has ordered a large polluting corporation to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement.\" De Rijk said the Paris climate targets could not be met unless corporations like Shell \u2014 one of the top 10 most-polluting companies worldwide, according to Friends of the Earth \u2014 also abide by emission reduction targets. Headquartered in The Hague, Royal Dutch Shell appeared in the nearby district court on charges that its emissions harm the fundamental rights of claimants led by Milieudefensie, six other organizations and more than 17,000 co-plaintiffs. The court agreed that Shell group emissions had an impact on climate change that is larger than that of most individual countries. The judgment stated that Shell has created risks for individuals that limited their human rights.\u00a0 Shell has previously maintained that litigation will not aid climate mitigation.\u00a0\"What will accelerate the energy transition is effective policy, investment in technology and changing customer behavior,\" a Shell spokesperson said.\u00a0\"None of which will be achieved with this court action.\" During the hearings, Milieudefensie's case hinged on the view that Shell had contravened the European convention on human rights by contributing significantly to \"dangerous climate change.\" The plaintiff noted that Shell is among 25 multinationals responsible for over half of all global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the past three decades. It\u00a0claimed that the Dutch oil and gas company's \"long knowledge of climate change, misleading statements on climate change, and inadequate action to reduce climate change\" constituted the \"unlawful endangerment of Dutch citizens.\" The case sets a groundbreaking precedent, said Laura Burgers, assistant law professor at the University of Amsterdam. \"Traditionally, human rights are formulated as obligations for states, not for private parties,\" she said. Shell headquarters in The Hague The 2015 case brought by Dutch climate NGO Urgenda, for example, forced the government to \"urgently and significantly\" reduce emissions in line with its human rights obligations \u2014 a decision that was upheld in the High Court in 2019. So, too, the German Constitutional Court\u00a0recently demanded the German government raise its 2030 emission reduction targets following a successful climate lawsuit\u00a0 based on the \"fundamental rights\"\u00a0of future generations who will be exposed to the full effects of climate change. Referring to the \"duty to protect future generations,\" the court found that the government \"should have taken precautionary steps to mitigate these major burdens in order to safeguard the freedom guaranteed by fundamental rights.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Milieudefensie and the other environmental organizations suing Shell also say they represent future generations,\" Burgers said.\u00a0\"International environmental law, as well as EU law, obliges to take on board the interests of future generations.\" While Shell has been legally held responsible for oil spills and ordered to pay compensation \u2014 most recently to residents in the Niger Delta\u00a0\u2014 the invocation of rights in The Hague was central to making a private company accountable to climate treaties for the first time. \"Climate litigation is a risk that companies cannot afford to ignore,\" said Paul Benson, a lawyer at environment NGO Client Earth, in relation to the decision. \"Especially oil and gas giants that are responsible for more emissions than entire countries.\" The ruling comes just months after Shell made a new commitment\u00a0to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 with what it calls a \"customer-first strategy.\" But the plaintiffs in the case argued that despite such promises Shell's emissions are still increasing. \"Unless these emissions are rapidly reduced in the next 10 years, we won't reach the Paris goals,\" Milieudefensie's de Rijk said. Such urgency drove the litigants to seek judicial intervention, and to spark what he predicts what will become a \"litigation wave\" against major polluters. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The major issue with Shell's net-zero plan is an offset strategy by which the company will essentially plant trees to balance ongoing oil and gas exploration. De Rijk says Shell will need to plant monoculture forests across an area that is three times the size of Brazil to reach the target. \"It's of course totally impossible,\" he said. \"Shell\u2019s carbon offset plans are putting communities in the Global South, particularly indigenous peoples and women farmers, at risk of devastating land grabs and rights abuses,\" wrote \u00a0Marit Maij, executive director of ActionAid Netherlands, one of the co-plaintiffs. With a global energy transition underway, and US President Joe Biden and other major emitters increasing emission reduction targets \u00a0in the lead-up to the COP26 climate summit in November, there is a view that Big Oil is losing crucial time, and money, since it will\u00a0inevitably be forced to transition. \"Global climate goals will only be achieved if companies like Shell really cooperate and actually reduce CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement,\" Maij wrote. \"But Shell does not want to do this: It is using its net zero climate plans as a smokescreen for inaction.\" The Dutch oil and gas giant is expected to appeal the decision.\u00a0 Lucas Roorda, assistant professor at Utrecht University, tweeted that the \"decision is provisionally enforceable, so Shell will have to start reducing emissions while appeal is pending.\" The $20 billion fund says oil companies including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell are not doing enough to meet goals set out in the Paris Agreement. But the fund has ruled out a blanket ban on fossil fuel companies.\n\u00a0 With fuel demand depressed by coronavirus and a price war threatening to pump out more oil, the fossil fuel industry's traditional revenue streams are on even shakier ground. Climate change will make that worse.\n\u00a0 The energy giant will have to pay four Nigerian farmers compensation and start a cleanup over pollution caused by leaking oil pipelines in the Niger Delta. \n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Shell ordered to reduce CO2 emissions in watershed\u00a0ruling", "article_name": "shell-ordered-to-reduce-co2-emissions-in-watershedruling", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/shell-ordered-to-reduce-co2-emissions-in-watershedruling/a-57669931", "date_published": "2021-05-26 00:00:00", "article_length": 7864, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:02:59.611515"}
{"id": null, "body": "     The debate over climate change is often dominated by carbon credits and emissions targets. But experts say it's time to put people at the center and, in particular, focus on one group that is most at risk - women. Women aren't just at risk from climate change; they can also change local behavior In 2007, cyclone Sidr battered the western coast of Bangladesh, killing more than 3,000 people \u2013 the majority of them women. It was no coincidence, according to Sharmind Neelormi, who's researched climate change vulnerability and impacts in her country. Not only were women in remote areas, often shut out from public life, the last to hear of the storm warning. Neelormi says many also shunned existing cyclone shelters many of which typically had just one flooded toilet on the ground floor. While the sight of men relieving themselves in the open is not unusual in Bangladesh, cultural mores make it impossible for women to do the same. \"It was a basic engineering fault which could have saved the lives of thousands of women,\" Neelormi said.  Women disproportionately affected The 41-year-old has since lobbied the government to redesign cyclone shelters. But the example underlines what some campaigners call the lack of a \"female factor\" in the climate change debate. Climate negotiations and adaptation strategies, they say, have responded poorly to the needs of women despite being most at risk. A 2009 study by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) found that women in developing nations bear the disproportionate burden of climate change since they do most of the agricultural work and are therefore affected by weather patterns impacting on food, energy and water. Women traditionally do much of the agricultural and manual work in developing nations Describing \"a cycle of deprivation,\" the report said that women in developing nations had less access to income-earning opportunities. They also managed households and cared for families, which limited their mobility and increased \"their vulnerability to sudden weather-related natural disasters,\" it said. Samantha Hung, gender expert from the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said there were linkages between poverty and climate change that put women more at risk than men. \"Women are generally more vulnerable than men to poverty. In the Asia Pacific region where over 600 million poor live on less than 1.25 dollars a day, the majority of them are women,\" Hung said. \"These women are more dependent on the natural resources available to maintain their livelihoods.\" She added that statistics show that women are much more likely even to die when there's a flood or tsunami.  'Important agents of change' But campaigners point out that it would be wrong to portray women simply as victims of climate change. \"Not only do we need to recognize that women are often particularly vulnerable to climate change but also that they're important agents of change in the whole process of adaptation,\" Angie Daz\u00e9, from Canada-based CARE said. She pointed out that women are often innovative in the way they manage household and natural resources. \"We need to empower women to use their knowledge and skills,\" she said. Daze's organization, which focuses on community-based adaptation projects with a gender focus, is currently active in northern Ghana. The group works to ensure that women's voices are heard in local planning processes. I've got the power - the Barefoot College in India trains rural women to become solar engineers Similar initiatives include the Barefoot College in India which trains women from agricultural communities in the north to become solar technicians and earn their own income. In Malawi, an Irish company is helping train rural women make and sell energy-efficient cook stoves. It reduces both the harmful smoke the women are exposed to when they cook with firewood as well as helps fight deforestation.  Women shut out from decision-making Despite these scattered efforts, placing women at the core of policies to tackle climate change still hasn't entered the mainstream. Gotelind Alber from Women for Climate Justice (Gender CC) said a lack of awareness and structural inequality remain the biggest hurdle. \"Women are underrepresented in climate change decision-making and planning at all levels,\" Alber said. \"Most people are in fact gender blind when it comes to climate.\" That blindness, some say, has resulted in an excessive focus on the economic aspects of climate change and big-scale technology. \"Science-driven, top-down approaches to adaptation may help in reducing vulnerability to climate change to an extent,\" Daz\u00e9 said. \"But without the social dimension, the gender perspective and needs of women are completely left out.\"  Slow progress While campaigners call for greater awareness and sensitization among policy-workers and donors, some progress has been made in recent years. Ever since the Copenhagen climate summit in 2010, groups focusing on the gender perspective in climate change meet regularly on the sidelines of UN climate talks and lobby governments. A men\u2019s club \u2013 women are underrepresented at international climate talks \"Since we've begun to raise our voice, we've noticed progress on gender-sensitive language being adopted in regulations and agreements at these summits,\" Alber said. That's a point raised by several campaigners who say that gender-sensitive language is a first step towards acknowledging the issue. \"But I don't think it's trickled down to governments incorporating these things on a national and local level,\" Alber said. One exception however is Bangladesh. Hard hit by the effects of climate change, the country has drawn lessons from its frequent floods and cyclones. Sharmind Neelormi said the government's 2009 national climate change strategy and action plan clearly states every adaptation activity \u2013 whether private or state-funded \u2013 must include a gender-sensitivity analysis. \"That is definitely a big step forward,\" Neelormi said.

{"id": null, "body": "     Supporters of nuclear energy say it can help us wean our economies off polluting fossil fuels. No surprise, it's a heated issue. But what about the facts? Can nuclear power really help save the climate? Nuclear power is expensive, especially when follow-up costs are taken into account The latest figures on global carbon dioxide emissions call into question the world's efforts to tackle the climate crisis. CO2 emissions are set to soar 4.9% in 2021 , compared with the previous year, according to a study published earlier this month by the Global Carbon Project (GCP), a group of scientists that track emissions. In 2020, emissions dropped 5.4% due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. Most observers expected a rebound this year \u2014 but not to such an extent. The energy sector continues to be the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with a share of 40%\u00a0\u2014 and rising. But what about nuclear ? Supporters of the controversial energy source say it's a climate-friendly way to generate electricity.\u00a0At the very least, it's something we could use until we're able to develop comprehensive alternatives . In recent weeks, particularly\u00a0during the COP26 climate summit , advocates have been\u00a0creating\u00a0a stir online with statements like \"if you're against nuclear energy, you're against climate protection\" and \" nuclear energy is about to make a comeback.\" But is there anything to it? No. Nuclear energy is also responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, no energy source is completely free of emissions, but more on that later. When it comes to nuclear, uranium extraction, transport and processing\u00a0produces emissions. The long and complex construction process of nuclear power plants also releases CO2, as does the demolition of decommissioned sites. And, last but not least, nuclear waste also has to be transported and stored under strict conditions \u2014 here, too, emissions must\u00a0be taken into account. Dismantling nuclear power plants \u2014 as seen here in M\u00fclheim-K\u00e4rlich, Germany \u2014 also produces CO2 And yet, interest groups claim nuclear energy is emission-free. Among them is Austrian consulting firm ENCO. In late 2020, it released a study prepared for the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy that looked favorably at the possible future role of nuclear\u00a0in the Netherlands. \"The main factors for its choice were reliability and security of supply, with no CO2 emission,\" it read. ENCO was founded by experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency, and it\u00a0regularly works with stakeholders in the nuclear sector, so it's not entirely free of vested interests. At COP26, environmental initiative\u00a0Scientists for Future (S4F) presented a paper on nuclear energy and the climate. The group came to a very different conclusion. \"Taking into account the current overall energy system, nuclear energy is by no means CO2 neutral ,\" they said.\u00a0 Ben Wealer of the Technical University of Berlin, one of the report's authors, told DW that proponents of nuclear energy \"fail to take into account many factors,\"\u00a0including\u00a0those sources of emissions outlined above. All the studies reviewed by DW said the same thing: Nuclear power is not emissions-free. Results vary significantly, depending on whether we only consider\u00a0the process of electricity generation, or take into account the entire life cycle of a\u00a0nuclear power plant. A report released in 2014 by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for example, estimated a range of 3.7 to 110 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It's long been assumed that nuclear\u00a0plants generate an average of 66 grams of CO2/kWh \u2014 though Wealer believes\u00a0the actual figure is much higher. New power plants, for example, generate more CO2 during construction than those built in previous decades, due to stricter safety regulations. Studies that include the entire life cycle of nuclear power plants, from uranium extraction to nuclear waste storage, are rare, with some researchers pointing out that data is still lacking. In one life cycle study , the Netherlands-based World Information Service on Energy (WISE) calculated that nuclear plants produce 117 grams of CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour. It should be noted, however, that WISE is an anti-nuclear group, so is\u00a0not entirely unbiased. However, other studies have come up with similar results when considering entire life cycles.\u00a0Mark Z. Jacobson, director of the Atmosphere / Energy Program at California's Stanford University, calculated a climate cost of 68 to 180 grams of CO2/kWh, depending on the electricity mix used in uranium production and other variables. If the entire life cycle of a nuclear plant is included in the calculation, nuclear energy certainly comes out ahead of fossil fuels like coal or natural gas. But the picture is\u00a0drastically\u00a0different when\u00a0compared with renewable energy. According to new but still unpublished data from the state-run German Environment Agency (UBA) as well as the WISE figures, nuclear power releases 3.5 times more CO2 per kilowatt-hour than photovoltaic solar panel systems. Compared with onshore wind power, that figure jumps to 13 times more CO2. When up against electricity from hydropower installations, nuclear generates 29 times more carbon. Around the world, nuclear energy representatives, as well as some politicians, have called for the expansion of atomic\u00a0power. In Germany, for example, the right-wing populist AfD party has backed nuclear power plants, calling them \"modern and clean.\" The AfD has called for a return to the energy source, which Germany\u00a0has pledged to phase out completely by the end of 2022. Other countries have also supported plans to build new nuclear plants, arguing that the energy sector will be even more damaging for the climate without it. But Wealer from Berlin's Technical University, along with numerous other energy experts, sees takes a different view. \"The contribution of nuclear energy is viewed too optimistically,\" he said. \"In reality, [power plant] construction times are too long and the costs too high to have a noticeable effect on climate change. It takes too long for nuclear energy to become available.\" Mycle Schneider, author of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report , agrees. \"Nuclear power plants are about four times as expensive as wind or solar, and take five times as long to build,\" he said. \"When you factor it all in, you're looking at 15-to-20 years of lead time for a new nuclear plant.\" He pointed out that the world needed to get greenhouse gases under control within a decade. \"And in the next 10 years, nuclear power won't be able to make a significant contribution,\" added Schneider.\u00a0 \"Nuclear power is not being considered at the current time as one of the key global solutions to climate change,\" said Antony Froggatt, deputy director of the environment and society program at the international affairs think tank Chatham House in London. He said a combination of excessive costs, environmental consequences and lack of public support were all arguments against nuclear power. Due to the high costs associated with nuclear energy, it also blocks important financial resources that could instead be used to develop renewable energy, said Jan Haverkamp, a nuclear expert and activist with environment NGO\u00a0Greenpeace in the Netherlands. Those renewables would provide more energy that is both faster and cheaper than nuclear, he said. \" Every dollar invested in nuclear energy is therefore a dollar diverted from true urgent climate action. In that sense, nuclear power is not climate-friendly,\" he said. In addition, nuclear energy itself has been affected by climate change. During the world's increasingly hot summers, several nuclear power plants have already had to be temporarily shut down or taken off the grid. Power plants depend on nearby water sources to cool their reactors, and with many rivers drying up,\u00a0those\u00a0sources of water are no longer guaranteed. The much vaunted \"renaissance of nuclear power\" is anything but when all the facts are taken into consideration, Mycle Schneider told DW. He said the nuclear industry has been shrinking for years. \"In the last 20 years, 95 nuclear power plants have gone online and 98 have been shut down. If you take China out of the equation, the number of nuclear power plants has shrunk by 50 reactors in the last two decades,\" Schneider added. \"The nuclear industry is not thriving.\" Additional reporting by Jo Harper and Gero Rueter This article was translated from German by Martin K\u00fcbler\u00a0 Correction, November 30, 2021: A previous version of this article unintentionally omitted one of two sources in the graphic 'How does electricity affect the environment?'. The Umweltbundesamt and WISE are the sources of the data. DW apologizes for the error. It has divided Germany for decades but now, it seems, an end could be in sight. A newly-formed commission will soon start working on a plan for a permanent nuclear waste storage site in Germany. So far, Gorleben, in Lower Saxony has been considered the country's number one proposed site, despite constant protests from environmentalists and locals. Dry cask storage containers, also sometimes known as castors, are left to cool in the current temporary storage facility near Gorleben. They contain spent nuclear fuel rods, stored in an inert gas for safety reasons. Their radioactivity will take many thousands of years to dissipate. There is currently no permanent storage facility for the radioactive byproducts of nuclear energy anywhere in the world, only facilities treated as temporary solutions. The Gorleben temporary storage site also currently holds waste imported from France, Europe's largest nuclear power producer, with the delivery trains frequently a site of public protests. A container with radioactive waste is moved to Gorleben in the German state of Lower Saxony. Often the transportation takes place at night, in order to minimise disruption and attention in the communities that the shipment is passing through. The event still remains a consistent headline-grabber in Germany. Protesters dress up at a protest to blockade a transport of nuclear waste into Gorleben. A 2012 survey showed that some 40 percent of Germans say that they wouldn't want to have a permanent nuclear waste storage site near their home. A salt mine near Gorleben is currently being investigated as a permanent storage facility for nuclear waste. Concerns about radioactivity moving into the water table are just one of the reasons why local residents are unhappy about the site being considered. He's been in office for less than a year but German Environment Minister Peter Altmeier has been under consistent pressure to get results on the issue of a permanent storage facility for nuclear waste. At the same time he's trying to push forward Germany's changeover to renewable energy, known domestically as the 'Energiewende'. Gorleben isn't the only nuclear waste storage site in Germany. Federal parliament recently approved a new regulation to clear the salt mine Asse II of 125,000 barrels of radioactive waste, although the project is yet to begin. The site, near Braunschweig, was used in the 1960s and 1970s to store waste from nuclear power plants. It is now completely sealed up. In this archive photo, a worker takes a sample of dripping water in the Asse mine. Some think that the water here could be contaminated with leaking radioactive waste from rusting barrels of waste and for that reason a cleanout needs to be sped up. Visitors are now able to visit the site but are equipped with geiger counters. All nuclear power plants in Germany are due to be shut down by 2020. The Neckarwestheim plant was closed down in 2011, following the catastrophe in Fukushima. Now, however, one of the power plants on the site is back functioning again. What ultimately happens to the spent fuel rods from the facility will stay uncertain until Germany settles on a permanent waste dump site.

{"id": null, "body": "     A UN-backed report says a million species are at risk of extinction, and warns biodiversity loss and failure to conserve ecosystems has catastrophic effects on people as well as nature. They are the tireless stewards of the air, water and land from which we live. But the millions of species whose toil underpins our prosperity are gravely endangered by human activity,\u00a0scientists say \u2014 and that imperils us in turn . Biodiversity loss is as big a threat to humans as climate change, said UN biodiversity chief Robert Watson last week at a conference in Paris to release a landmark report on global biodiversity and ecosystems. \"The continuing loss of biodiversity will undermine our ability for poverty reduction, food and water security, human health and the overall goal of leaving nobody behind.\" The report, the first of its kind since 2005 and published today by the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), warns of grave consequences to humanity from mass die-offs and degradation of nature. Drawing together the work of more than 400 experts, it paints a bleak picture of a world in which\u00a0essentials such as food and drinking water are endangered through species and ecosystem decline. The unprecedented and accelerating deterioration of nature in the past 50 years has been driven by changes in land and sea use , exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution and invasive species, the report found. These five drivers are, in turn, underpinned by societal behaviors ranging from consumption to governance. In a blow to\u00a0human progress, damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 UN sustainable development targets for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities climate, oceans and land, the authors found. Diplomats from 130 nations gathered in Paris last week to agree on the final wording of the report's summary for policymakers. \"The loss of species, ecosystems and genetic diversity is already a global and generational threat to human well-being,\" said Watson. \"Protecting the invaluable contributions of nature to people will be the defining challenge of decades to come.\" The Great Barrier Reef is an ecosystem dying from climate change The Amazon rainforest's biodiversity is threatened by expanding cropland Why biodiversity matters Biodiversity, a contraction of biological diversity, means the abundance and variety of life on the planet. The definition encompasses more than just the creatures we can see. It ranges from tiny genes,\u00a0bacteria, plants and animals, right up to ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest and Great Barrier Reef . That makes it hard to count \u2014 and even harder to value. While there are about 1.5 million identified species in the world, scientists estimate the true figure may be closer to ten million or even as many as two billion. Many organisms are so small\u00a0they can only be identified as distinct species through DNA sequencing. \"If you think about biodiversity, you think about tigers and polar bears,\" said Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist at the World Wildlife Fund. \"Those species are very important \u2014 but also important are the species you never see and talk about.\" Without bees pollinating crops and trees turning carbon dioxide into oxygen, even basic human tasks such as eating and breathing become harder. But quieter losses hurt people too, such as the decline of medicinal plants and mangroves that protect coastlines . The ways in which organisms interact mean the decline of any single species can trigger unexpected losses in the wider ecosystem. For instance, a fall in earthworms, fungi or soil microbes limits the amount of recycled nutrients in the soil and the number of holes for rainwater to flow through, stunting crop growth and hindering humanity's ability to feed itself. \"We don't consider that nature, but it is nature,\" said Shaw. \"Not paying attention to all those complex interactions in the soil \u2014 and thinking we can just put on fertilizer or pesticide and have it stay the same productive soil into the next generation \u2014 is foolish.\" The report found that about a quarter of the plant and animal species assessed face extinction, many within decades, unless urgent action is taken. How it hurts us Counted by biomass, humans comprise just 0.01 % of global biodiversity. But the report details the outsized ways in which our species has endangered others by razing forests, polluting rivers, overfishing oceans, killing off insects, and otherwise hurting nature in a headlong push to extract its resources. \"Nature makes human development possible but our relentless demand for the earth\u2019s resources is accelerating extinction rates and devastating the world\u2019s ecosystems,\" said Joyce Msuya, acting head of UN Environment. The report also found: Agriculture is particularly sensitive, with just nine\u00a0plant species now accounting for more than two-thirds of global crop output, and, as Shaw described, the soil on which they grow under threat. In a sign of the powerful feedback loops at play, agriculture is itself a major driver of biodiversity loss, with pesticides, soil erosion and forest clearance destroying habitats and sinking wildlife populations. And in addition to its effect on food systems, the devastation of the earth's soil \u00a0reduces its ability to retain water, hitting humans by increasing water stress and the frequency of floods. The repercussions of human activity on nature are made worse by climate change, the report found, which is in turn exacerbated by damage to ecosystems, such as loss of forests that convert carbon dioxide into oxygen. A study published last year \u00a0in the journal Science found that\u00a0even if countries honor their current pledges to limit carbon emissions , 49 % of insects and 44 % of plants will lose more than half their geographical habitat by 2100. Fungi and microbes work together to make soils fertile How we can stop it While some of the problems listed in the report have been known for decades, scientists have struggled to convey the urgency with which they need to be dealt. In 2010, the United Nations declared a \"decade of biodiversity\" to reduce biodiversity loss. But according to today's report, it made good progress with only a handful of the 20 targets it set its members, such as conserving marine areas and prioritizing invasive alien species. Every target related to addressing the underlying drivers had seen either moderate or poor progress. But, the report said, \"urgent and concentrated efforts\" can still conserve and restore nature so it can be used sustainably. Conservation efforts have so far focused on big animals such as orangutans Avoiding the negative effects of biodiversity loss to 2050 and beyond requires \"transformative\" policy change, the authors wrote. They proposed a broad-ranging toolkit of policies including sustainable agricultural practices, incentivizing reductions in consumption and waste , effective fishing quotas and collaborative water management. While the report's recommendations were targeted at policy-makers, scientists say many consumer choices, such as reducing beef consumption and eating sustainably-sourced fish, are needed to conserve ecosystems. The authors also highlighted the importance of developing global financial\u00a0systems that steer away from the \"limited paradigm\" of economic growth. \u201cThe report also tells us that it is not too late to make a difference,\"\u00a0Watson\u00a0said. \"But only if we start now at every level from local to global.\" Great news: UNESCO removed a portion of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the world's second largest coral reef, from the List of World Heritage in Danger. The outstanding natural ecosystem off the coast of Belize was put on the list in 2009. Since then, the government has stepped up conservation efforts, setting \"an example for the rest of the world,\" said Mechtild Rossler of UNESCO. But there's also bad news: UNESCO newly listed Kenya's Lake Turkana National Parks as endangered due to concerns about a dam in neighboring Ethiopia, which is feared will disrupt the flow and ecosystem of Lake Turkana. The three national parks surrounding the lake are a stopping point for migratory birds, and a major breeding ground for crocodiles, hippopotamus and snakes. There are more than 200 UNESCO Natural World Heritage sites around the globe; more than a dozen of them are endangered. The Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park in the Central African Republic, for example, was added to the \"in danger\" list in 1997 following reports of illegal poaching. According to some reports, hunters may have harvested as much as 80 percent of the park's wildlife. Preserving natural heritage sites can be a dangerous job. In the Virunga National Park, more than 175 rangers and guards have lost their lives since 1996 while protecting wildlife against poachers and other armed groups. The park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo hosts exceptional biodiversity and is home to the iconic mountain gorillas. It was added to the endangered list in 1994. Global demand for ivory continues to be one of the main reasons why UNESCO considers natural reserves to be endangered. Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, one of the largest remaining wilderness areas in Africa, was added to the list in 2014 because widespread poaching is decimating populations of elephants and rhinos. Many of the endangered world heritage sites provide habitat for species that are threatened with extinction. Sumatran orangutans, for example, rely for their survival on three national parks collectively known as the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra. However, illegal logging and extensive agriculture, including for palm oil, are destroying their habitat. Besides conserving biodiversity, UNESCO World Heritage also protects the livelihoods of local communities. More than 2,000 indigenous people have managed to preserve their traditional way of life in the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve in Honduras. The reserve was removed from the endangered list in 2007, but added again in 2011 due to illegal logging. This is why locals are armed. UNESCO's mission is to provide emergency assistance and to encourage local governments and citizens to participate in conservation efforts. Despite ongoing threats to many natural sanctuaries, the program has also yielded several success stories. The Galapagos Archipelago, for example, was removed from the endangered list in 2010 after Ecuador's government stepped up conservation measures.

{"id": null, "body": "     Political leaders from 64 countries and the European Union have committed to stronger environmental protections after a UN report found the world has failed to meet any of its biodiversity targets. Leaders from across the world have promised to turn environmental degradation around and put nature on the path to recovery within a decade. \u00a0 \"We are in a state of planetary emergency,\" the 65 leaders, who include German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, wrote ahead of a UN biodiversity summit on Wednesday. \"We commit ourselves not simply to words, but to meaningful action and mutual accountability.\" \u00a0 The commitments, which come two days before a UN\u00a0biodiversity summit in New York,\u00a0include eliminating plastic leakage to the oceans by 2050 and incentivizing banks and businesses to value the natural world. The leaders identify unsustainable production and consumption as a key driver of environmental crises that \"require urgent and immediate global action.\" \u00a0 But strongmen leading some of the world's biggest polluters \u2014 US, China, India, Russia and Brazil \u2014 are not among the signatories.\u00a0 Missed targets The pledge follows the September publication of a landmark assessment of biodiversity which showed humanity had failed to fully achieve\u00a0any of the 20 global biodiversity targets set by the UN ten years ago. Just six of them had been \"partly achieved\", the report said. For one goal, on protecting coral reefs , the world was found to be\u00a0moving in the opposite direction. An oil spill in Mauritius in July is threatening coral reefs and other areas of rich biodiversity Indigenous people in Brazil blocked a highway in August that has enabled deforestation of the Amazon rainforest Data from individual governments shows\u00a0that a third of national biodiversity targets, which are set by the countries themselves, are on track to be met or exceeded. But these are less ambitious than the UN targets and less than a quarter match up well with the global goals to protect nature. The vision for biodiversity set out in 2010 is only achievable if the world responds to \"compelling evidence\" that \"transformative change\" is required, said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity, which prepared the Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO) report. The charge sheet is long. Pollution from plastics and pesticides have not been brought down to safe levels. Governments still subsidize businesses that damage ecosystems . Coral reefs, which are dying across the world, are struck by the triple-threat of human action: climate change, pollution and overfishing. Some of those drivers are getting worse. Fish populations are recovering in waters managed by sustainable fishing policies More than 3 billion people rely on fish for 20% of their daily protein intake And even where there is progress, it is rarely enough. Deforestation should have been halted by now, but\u00a0has only been cut by a third, with Asia and Europe gaining forests while Africa and South America lose them at a faster rate. Conservation efforts have saved species like the Puerto Rican amazon parrot and the Mongolian Przewalski's horse. But they have failed to keep others like the Western Black Rhino or the Christmas Island pipistrelle from being wiped out forever. While the big trends in biodiversity loss were already known, the UN report included \"systematic analysis\" on how well the world has achieved the 2010 targets, said Josef Settele, an ecologist at the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany, who contributed research to the report but was not involved in writing it.\u00a0 \"There is also some brightness,\" Settele added. \"The things we are doing are not completely in vain.\" For instance, almost 100 countries have incorporated biodiversity values into national accounting systems. Over the last 20 years, the world has increased the share of protected areas from 10% to 15% on land and from 3% to 7% in water. There are now more fish in waters managed by good fishing policies. Governments are increasingly eradicating invasive species from islands. And since 1993, conservation actions have prevented the extinction\u00a0of between 28 and 48 bird and mammal species, according to a study published this month in the journal Conservation Letters \u2014 though many remain highly threatened and may still become extinct. \"The progress toward conserving life on earth has been much greater than it would have been [without action],\" said Thomas Brooks, chief scientist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, who was a co-author of the Conservation Letters study but was not involved in the GBO. \"The absolutely key question is how to scale up from where things currently are, in terms of responses, to meet targets comprehensively.\" Bee populations are falling because of intensive farming, pesticides, pollution and climate change Damage to ecosystems puts food security at risk The way to get that scale, according to the GBO report, is by \"mainstreaming\" the opportunities and responsibilities from protecting nature. That means every level of society \u2014 from individuals and local communities to businesses and national governments \u2014 would need to factor biodiversity into their economic decisions. Like climate change, ecological collapse is happening at breakneck speed. A 2019 report by IPBES, the UN panel of biodiversity experts, found that humans are altering the natural world at an \"unprecedented pace\" and threatening 1 million animal and plant species with extinction. Scientists say both issues require systemic changes, but individual actions can help. Agriculture is one of the greatest drivers of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. A study published in the journal Nature this month found that more than two-thirds\u00a0of future biodiversity losses could be avoided by conserving and restoring land, reducing food waste and switching to more plant-based diets. They are among many actions laid out in the GBO report to reduce and eventually restore lost biodiversity. If we do not act faster, said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Program, \"biodiversity will continue to buckle\" under the weight of overexploitation, climate change, pollution, invasive alien species and changes to land and sea. \"This will further damage human health, economies and societies \u2014\u00a0with particularly detrimental effects on indigenous peoples and local communities.\" This is an updated version of an earlier article. Why do we find it so hard to change our behavior? German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk explains how this is connected to the climate crisis.\n\u00a0 A UN-backed report says a million species are at risk of extinction, and warns biodiversity loss and failure to conserve ecosystems has catastrophic effects on people as well as nature. \n\u00a0 While endangered species such as the spiny seahorse have started to recolonize former habitats due to coronavirus lockdowns, a new study confirms that the number of extinction-threatened species is rising fast. \n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Countries pledge to reverse destruction of nature after missing biodiversity targets", "article_name": "global-biodiversity-outlook-targets-extinction-summit-new-york-pledge", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/global-biodiversity-outlook-targets-extinction-summit-new-york-pledge/a-54932895", "date_published": "2020-09-28 00:00:00", "article_length": 7175, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:01.558705"}
{"id": null, "body": "     The EU's right-wing populists generally have little interest in climate protection, a new study shows. However, that hasn't stopped Germany's AfD and Britain's UKIP from voting against it in the European Parliament. Right-wing populists are projected to make significant gains in the European Parliament elections in May. That could shape the debate in Brussels \u2014 not only on migration and border management, but also on climate protection . A study by the Berlin-based Adelphi think tank takes a closer look at where the most powerful right-wing parties in the European Union actually stand on the issue of climate change and environmental protection. The researchers surveyed election programs, public statements by party leadership and\u00a0press releases, as well as key votes on climate and energy policy in the European Parliament. Read more : Can Europe go carbon neutral by 2050? The study found that for most right-wing populists, climate change is either not an important issue, or they do not believe it exists, or they believe it is not man-made. Two out of three lawmakers from the right-wing populist spectrum in the European Parliament regularly vote against climate and energy policy measures, according to Alexander Carius and Stella Schaller, the authors of the study. Right-wing populists currently hold 15 percent of the seats in the European Parliament, but account for 48 percent of the votes against measures on the issues of climate and energy. AfD,\u00a0UKIP deny climate change With regard to climate protection, Carius and Schaller identified\u00a0three categories of right-wing parties. Read more : How right-wing nationalism fuels climate denial MEP and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has denied the existence of man-made climate change Seven of the 21 parties they examined belong to the group of \"deniers and skeptics\" who dispute, or at least cast doubt on, scientific findings about the influence of human actions on the climate. The group includes the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) and the Swedish Democrats. According to the study, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Britain's UKIP in particular vehemently deny climate change. In fact, \"denying climate change is a key feature of their profile,\" the authors say. The AfD has close ties with the European Institute for Climate & Energy's climate skeptics, according to Berlin's Tagesspiegel daily. Last year, AfD lawmaker Karsten Hilse referred to man-made climate change as a misconception. Fidesz the exception The next category comprises the \"cautious\" parties. According to the study, 11 parties either have no explicit position on climate change or attach little importance to the issue, including Italy's Lega Nord and Poland's Law and Justice party (PiS), as well as the National Rally in France. Read more : Far-right populists and climate policy: An attempt to move the goalposts The third group, the \"approvers,\" are an exception: only Finland's nationalist Finns Party, the Latvian National Alliance and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party acknowledge the danger climate change poses to the world. Orban has even spoken out in favor of the Paris Climate Agreement . The authors of the study make it clear, however, that while Fidesz emphasizes the global nature of the problem, \"what they do for climate protection on the national level is weak.\" Arguing against climate protection The AfD has called lignite coal mining 'indispensable' According to the study, right-wing populists often reject climate protection measures in the European Parliament because they tend to be multilateral by nature, which means they expect international cooperation beyond national borders. Many right-wing populists are skeptical about possible climate protection measures because they fear damage to their respective domestic economies: Both the PiS and the AfD are fighting for a continuation of coal mining , for example. \"Lignite will be indispensable for the foreseeable future,\" the AfD stipulated in its program for German state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia in 2017. Fear of losing out to countries with less strict environmental regulations \u2014 such as the United States or China \u2014 is often part of right-wing populist campaign rhetoric. The parties also often argue that climate protection measures are an unjustified burden on consumers and workers due to higher electricity and gas prices and the phase-out of jobs in the coal mining sector. Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally is currently vying for the votes of the yellow vest protesters who have objected to, among other things, a higher taxation of fossil fuels. Read more : How Europe's far-right parties view the EU However, right-wing populists are not necessarily skeptical of every climate protection measure, the study's authors point out. Not just black and white Right-wing populists do disagree massively on some climate-related issues, including renewable energy. Lega Nord in Italy aims to expand renewable energy production, just like the FP\u00d6 in Austria. Le Pen demands cutting the use of fossil fuels to make France \"less dependent on Gulf states like Saudi Arabia, that send us not only their oil, but also their ideology.\" Germany's AfD rejects wind farms and is fighting against the country's Renewable Energy Sources Act. The criticism of a renewable and sustainable energy supply is based on the outdated assumption, the study says, that it is\u00a0considerably more expensive than conventional sources. \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate protection: Where do the EU's right-wing populists stand?", "article_name": "climate-protection-where-do-the-eus-right-wing-populists-stand", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-protection-where-do-the-eus-right-wing-populists-stand/a-47699703", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 5582, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:04.321594"}
{"id": null, "body": "     The \"deoxygenation\" of oceans is having disastrous consequences for sea life. It will \"affect hundreds of millions of people,\" environmental experts warn. The oceans are losing oxygen due to climate change, with dire consequences for marine life and vulnerable communities and fisheries, a nature conservation report revealed Saturday. This is the \"ultimate wake-up call\" for humanity on ever-increasing carbon emissions, according to the report,\u00a0published\u00a0at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid .\u00a0 The authors say the report, \"Ocean deoxygenation: Everyone's problem,\"\u00a0is the\u00a0largest ever peer-reviewed study into the causes and\u00a0impacts of, and possible solutions to, the ocean's oxygen loss.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0 EU Parliament declares 'climate emergency' \"With this report, the scale of damage climate change is wreaking upon the ocean comes into stark focus. As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray,\" said Dr Grethel Aguilar, acting director general at The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a body\u00a0composed of\u00a0governmental and civil society groups. Pointing the way: Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has been leading protests across the globe as she tries to get world leaders to \"listen to the science\" 'Ultimate wake-up call' \"The potentially dire effects on fisheries and vulnerable coastal communities mean that the decisions made at the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference are even more crucial. To curb ocean oxygen loss alongside the other disastrous impacts of climate change, world leaders must commit to immediate and substantial emission cuts.\" According to the report, areas of water\u00a0with low oxygen concentrations are expanding, with roughly\u00a0700 ocean areas across the globe\u00a0now affected by low oxygen conditions \u2014\u00a0up from only 45 in the 1960s. Over the past five decades, the areas completely depleted of oxygen have\u00a0quadrupled. \"This is perhaps the ultimate wake-up call from the uncontrolled experiment humanity is unleashing on the world's ocean as carbon emissions continue to increase,\" said Dan Laffoley, senior adviser on marine science and conservation in IUCN's Global Marine and Polar Programme and a co-editor of the analysis. \"Ocean oxygen depletion is menacing marine ecosystems already under stress from ocean warming and acidification. To stop the worrying expansion of oxygen-poor areas, we need to decisively curb greenhouse gas emissions as well as nutrient pollution from agriculture and other sources.\" It's not called the blue planet for nothing. The ocean covers up to 71% of the Earth's surface and 90% of the biosphere. It is integral to life and provides anywhere between 50 to 80% of the planet's oxygen, making it a vital part of the carbon cycle. The ocean's origins are still unknown, but it is thought to have formed 4.4 billion years ago, providing a catalyst for early life-forms. Despite its sheer size, we actually know very little about the ocean. In fact, over 80% of this underwater realm has yet to be mapped or explored. Scientists are working to unlock its mysteries, which could help us better understand environmental change and how to manage vital ocean resources in times of climate change. We do know that the ocean plays a major role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing solar radiation, distributing heat and driving weather patterns. But climate change is already starting to disrupt this balance, affecting the ocean's ability to perform key ecosystem tasks, such as carbon storage and oxygen generation. The ocean is home to at least 230,000 known species. Coral reefs on the sea floor provide a safe-haven for invertebrates like crabs, starfish and mollusks, as well as colorful reef fish. Plant life flourishes in the shallow depths, while bigger creatures like sharks, whales and dolphins roam the deep open waters. Unsurprisingly, scientists also think up to two-thirds of all ocean species may still be undiscovered. But researchers are finding new species every year \u2014 many of them unlike anything found before, such as this squidworm (pictured), discovered in the Celebes Sea in 2007. What else might be lurking down there is anyone's guess. But the ocean is under pressure. One of the most obvious examples being the increase of coral bleaching events in reefs around the world. Increased temperatures and pollution stress corals, causing them to expel a special kind of algae which allows them to grow and reproduce, leaving behind a ghostly skeleton. Some corals can recover, but prolonged stressors increase the chances of reef mortality. Climate change is also seriously impacting marine species, with recent research showing that local populations of fish, mollusks and crabs are disappearing at twice the rate of land species. Extreme temperatures are the main culprit, as the ocean offers fewer places to hide from the heat. Sadly, the majority of ocean species won't be able to evolve fast enough to adapt to the changing conditions. In the cryosphere \u2014 parts of the Earth's surface covered in solid water, including ice and snow \u2014 atmospheric warming is causing the melting of glaciers and ice. The current melting event is already contributing to global sea level rise and could also lead to higher levels of ocean acidification, thanks to methane released from seafloor permafrost in the Arctic Ocean. Humans are inextricably linked to the ocean. For thousands of years communities have thrived along the coast, relying on it for food and livelihoods. Today, more than one billion people live in low-lying coastal regions which are likely to be impacted by rising sea levels. But this connection has come at a cost. Just 13% of the world's oceans are completely free from human activities such as fishing, with almost no true wilderness left along coastal areas. Technological advancements mean even the farthest reaches of ocean in the Arctic are no longer untouched. Protecting the remaining wilderness will be a challenge for generations to come.  Author: Ineke Mules Disaster for sea-life, consequences for humanity The effects of the oceans' lack of oxygen is beginning to alter the balance of marine life, favoring low-oxygen tolerant species (e.g. microbes, jellyfish and some squid) at the expense of low-oxygen sensitive ones (many marine species, including most fish). Tuna, marlin and sharks are particularly vulnerable to the changes. The species are starting to be driven into increasingly shallow surface layers of oxygen-rich water, making them more exposed\u00a0to excessive fishing. The report predicts that the ocean will\u00a0lose 3-4% of its oxygen inventory globally by the turn of the next century. Most of the losses are anticipated\u00a0to be\u00a0in the upper 1000 meters (3300 feet) of the water column, which is richest in marine biodiversity.

{"id": null, "body": "     Global utility companies have been slow to go green, undermining efforts to tackle climate change, according to a new report. But that may be changing. Only 10% of global energy utility companies are expanding their renewable energy capacity at a faster rate than their gas or coal-fired capacity. That is the main finding of a study by Galina Alova\u00a0from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford. The study, published in research journal Nature Energy , found that of the 3,000 utilities studied most remain predominantly invested in fossil fuels. And of those prioritizing renewable energy growth, 60% had not halted expansion of their fossil fuel portfolios. The companies with the slowest transition tended to be larger and from outside Europe, Alova told DW. \"The renewables-prioritizing cohort of utilities that I identified comprises companies that are overall larger and own a larger market share in the countries where they operate, compared to the other companies,\" she said.\u00a0\"The key issue is that the majority of these companies continue in parallel to expand their fossil fuel-based capacity, although they do so at a slower rate.\" Read more: \u00a0 Germany's coal imports down, but still crucial Her research highlights a gap between what is needed to tackle the climate crisis and \"the actions being taken by the utility sector,\" she added. These companies face the risk of carbon lock-in, given that a third of their fossil fuel capacity has been added in the last 10 years, so is here to stay for decades. \"Unless it is retired early, it will render significant shares of their portfolios stranded,\" Alova said. \"Although there have been a few high-profile examples of individual electric utilities investing in renewables, this study shows that overall, the sector is making the transition to clean energy slowly or not at all,\" she said. Alova believes inertia in the electricity industry is one key reason for the slow transition. The report found that 10% of utilities favored growth in gas-fired power plants, dominated by the US utilities exploiting the country's shale gas reserves, followed by Russia and Germany.\u00a0 \"Renewables and natural gas often go hand in hand,\" Alova said, adding that companies often choose both in parallel. \"So, it might be just in media reports we are getting this image of investing in renewables, but less coverage on continued investment in gas.\"\u00a0 It might also be the case that gas is viewed as a transition fuel, relatively less carbon emitting and providing load-balancing services to intermittent renewables generation, Alova said. Dave Jones, senior electricity analyst for independent climate think tank Ember, agrees with Alova that utilities have hindered the transition by \"misunderstanding the future of gas.\"\u00a0Utilities have a mindset to\u00a0build big centralized power plants, replacing\u00a0a coal power plant with a gas power plant, he said. \"Fortunately, most of the\u00a0gas hype across the world is now dying down,\u00a0as wind and solar now provide cheaper options for generating electricity,\" Jones said. Over a fifth of Europe's energy was generated by solar panels and wind turbines in the first half of 2020,\u00a0according to a report by Ember.\u00a0Denmark came out on top, generating 64% of its energy from these renewable sources, followed by Ireland (49%) and Germany \u00a0(42%). In\u00a0Ember's half-year review released in July,\u00a0renewables exceeded fossil fuel generation for the first time ever, producing 40% of the EU's power, with fossil fuels contributing 34%. However, globally only a tenth of all energy was generated by these sources during the first half of 2020.\u00a0 Last year saw\u00a0the use of coal\u00a0to generate electricity around the world fall by a record 3%. In part due to COVID-19, coal generation in the first half of 2020 again broke records with a drop of 8.3%. In the EU, the drop was higher, as coal energy generation fell by nearly a third. With many projects delayed by the pandemic, the global capacity to produce electricity from renewable sources\u00a0is predicted to drop by up to 13% overall this year\u00a0according to the International Energy Agency. Utilities have been slow to understand how quickly wind and solar would drop in price, and also how quickly governments would want to move away from coal. \"Many utilities have been caught off guard by the speed of the transition, and have suffered financially ever since,\" said Jones.\u00a0 The world this year has generated\u00a0one-tenth of its electricity from wind and solar, double from the 5% in 2015,\u00a0and that increase has led to a fall in market\u00a0share of coal generation, Jones added.\u00a0 Valentina Kretzschmar from consultancy Wood Mackenzie says BP's recently announced strategy has created a new industry benchmark. BP plans to increase investment in its low-emission businesses, including renewable energy, by tenfold in the next decade to $5 billion (\u20ac4.5 billion) a year, while cutting back oil and gas production by 40%. In July, Royal Dutch Shell won a deal to build a wind farm off the coast of the Netherlands, while France's Total has agreed to make several large investments in solar power in Spain and a wind farm off Scotland. Total also bought an electric and natural gas utility in Spain. Shell has said it will delay offshore oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea. US giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, however,\u00a0have been slower than their European counterparts to commit to climate goals. \"I have seen a substantial shift between companies in the fossil fuel clusters toward renewables,\" Alova said. \"This signals that the companies that have been growing fossil fuel portfolios in the earlier time periods might be switching to renewables more recently.\" India should commit to carbon neutrality by ending fossil fuel subsidies and investing in solar power, the UN secretary-general has told an online audience. Investing in coal is \"bad economics,\" Antonio Guterres said.\n\u00a0 Climate activists demanding the closure of a new coal-fired power station have staged multiple protests, in Berlin and Finland. Finnish-run Datteln 4, near Dortmund, flouts Germany's goal to switch to renewables. \u00a0 Poland's biggest coal producer won't restructure its mines or cut salaries as planned.

{"id": null, "body": "     Forests, soils and oceans are the unsung heroes of our climate, storing the greenhouse gases that cause global heating. But they could perform even better with a little help. Dead plants in swamps and moors often don't decompose; instead they transform into CO2-storing peat Smoking industrial chimneys, exhaust fumes, fires in the Amazon \u2014 yearly carbon emissions recently swelled to 12,000,000,000 tons (12 gigatons).And as carbon increases, so do temperatures. Around half of\u00a0emissions released\u00a0remain in the atmosphere. Nature absorbs the rest , holding it in carbon sinks , such as soil, oceans and vegetation. These natural storage solutions slow climate change far more effectively than any human technology \u2014 carbon storage factories store just 40 megatons of CO2 annually or 0.003% of anthropogenic emissions. Natural carbon sinks could perform even better with a little tweaking and for a comparatively small\u00a0price tag. But humans are destroying more and more natural CO2 sinks, damaging our most successful tool to halt a\u00a0climate catastrophe. As humans rapidly increased their carbon emissions by burning fossil fuels, the amount of CO2 absorbed by plants, soils and oceans also increased. Plants actually benefit from an oversupply because high CO2 concentrations mean they must open their pores only briefly to absorb the gas. This way they lose less water and can better survive droughts. However, scientists say plants and oceans will soon reach their absorption capacity. For instance, by 2050 , ocean surfaces will be completely saturated with CO2. Humanity is also now producing more carbon than nature can process, and so the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is rising rapidly. The world's forests absorb a total of 15.6 gigatons of CO2 per year. That's three times the annual CO2 emissions of the United States. But around half of this leaks back into the atmosphere thanks to deforestation and forest fires. Worldwide, deforestation accounts for a fifth of all greenhouse gases ever produced by humans. The Amazon rainforest, for example, is one of the world's most valuable carbon sinks. But since Jair Bolsonaro became\u00a0Brazilian president in 2019, more and more of this vital ecosystem is being lost . Conversion of forest to agricultural land\u00a0means the Amazon basin now emits as much carbon as the remaining forest can sequester. Soon it could become like the tropical forests of Southeast Asia, which for years have been emitting more CO2 than they absorb. Some tropical rainforests are already emitting more carbon than they store Establishing additional forests could help boost the vegetation carbon sink. New woodland also absorbs more carbon than old stock because it produces lots of new biomass. But planting new trees is not the best option, said Jared Messinger, manager of the Global Restoration Initiative at the environmental research organization, the World Resources Institute. \"You know, continuing stewardship and longevity of the program with\u00a0tree planting \u2014\u00a0and [the involved] mortality rate \u2014\u00a0is very costly,\"\u00a0said Messinger, adding it would be cheaper to let forests grow naturally\u00a0in\u00a0open areas. Young trees growing on deforested land could neutralize up to 23% of annual emissions, nearly halving atmospheric CO2 growth, according to the WRI . Saplings would be particularly effective in warm, humid areas of West and Central Africa. Forests require considerable land, however, to be effective carbon sinks \u2014 and with a growing demand for food, they will have to compete with agriculture for that land. If newly planted forests were to be cleared, any stored CO2 would be released, negating the positive effects. Soil does not absorb CO2 as quickly, but it outperforms vegetation in the amount it stores. About half the soil in Central Europe, for example, is made up of carbon. Globally soil contains almost twice as much CO2 as living flora and the atmosphere combined. How well it stores carbon, however, depends on soil type, vegetation and climate. In general, the wetter and colder, the better. Soils under northern boreal forests and temperate grasslands hold particularly large amounts. Plants store carbon as sugar during photosynthesis, which often remains stored in the soil after the plant dies Peatlands and marshes are the carbon sink champions. The world's peatlands account for about a third of the total CO2 absorbed by soil, although they make up just 3% of the world's land area. In these wetlands, plant debris sinks into shallow, slightly acidic water. The debris\u00a0doesn't decompose in this oxygen-poor environment and instead turns into carbon-storing peat. Draining peatlands exposes the layers underneath to oxygen, triggering a decomposition process that releases CO2. Oxidation also produces nitrous oxide , which is about 300 times more harmful to the climate than carbon. Peatlands like this one in Belgium are the undervalued heroes of CO2 storage Despite their tremendous abilities, peatlands and wetlands are under pressure around the world. In Indonesia, peat forests are giving way to palm oil plantations and are being destroyed by forest fires, generating huge emissions. Meanwhile, Germany has drained almost all its former peatlands. Just 0.02% remains of the original 5% land area. Dust, or more precisely basalt dust, could improve soil's carbon storage abilities. When scattered on fields it reacts with CO2 dissolved in soil water, according to researchers writing in peer-reviewed journal, Nature Geoscience . The particles are then washed into lakes and oceans before being deposited as sediment. The process also occurs naturally. But it occurs more quickly with finely ground basalt because of its large surface area. Basalt also secretes minerals that boost plant growth in nutrient-poor soils, which in turn would store more CO2. Spreading basalt dust across arable land could improve soil's carbon storage Spreading basalt once across a piece of arable land the size of Asia would store 2.5 gigatons of CO2 per year. That's equivalent to India's annual emissions . Other researchers estimate the climate gain could be double that. Basalt is also relatively easy to come by even without new mines, as it's a byproduct of cement and steel production. Still, vegetation and soils cannot match the enormous\u00a0potential of the oceans. Seas store up to 80% of the world's carbon. Theoretically, they could absorb 95% of human-made greenhouse gases but this would take too long. Trees store carbon on an annual cycle. In contrast, it takes centuries for CO2 particles to sink from the surface and to be stored in the deep sea. At the same time, carbon concentration at the surface\u00a0lowers absorption of new emissions.\u00a0 Furthermore, cold water absorbs more CO2 than warm water and as temperatures rise with climate change, the oceans' ability to absorb emissions decreases. But it's not just the water that can store CO2: Marine plants such as algae and seagrass are on the case too. Seaweed alone removes 0.173 gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere each year before it dies and sinks to the ocean floor, researchers estimated in Nature Geoscience . This is why companies like Pull to Refresh are experimenting with giant kelp farms at sea that would sequester CO2.\u00a0 Whether trees, moors or oceans, nature is helping humans to mitigate climate damage. Basalt fertilizer, new forests on land\u00a0or seaweed could boost the carbon-sucking potential of natural sinks. Could seaweed farms help the world toward its climate goals? But this all comes at a price.\u00a0Forests remove carbon from the air, for example, at a cost of $7.50 to $27 (\u20ac6.60 to \u20ac23.60) per ton of CO2. Basalt fertilization would cost between $80 and $180 . Technical solutions that filter CO2 directly from the air are even more expensive , ranging from $134 to $342 per ton, according to the International Energy Agency. It's cheaper not to burn carbon in the first place and avoid emissions through insulation, green energy and conservation. \"Cutting emissions is the most important thing that we can do. And so I think that's always number one,\" said Jared Messinger of the World Resources Institute.\u00a0 Translated from German\u00a0by Elliot Douglas\u00a0 \n Capturing and burying CO2 is heralded as the technological fix to mitigate climate change. But many oil and gas majors are using the technology to produce more fossil fuels.\n\u00a0 Often overlooked as critical carbon sinks, peatlands store at least twice as much carbon as forests. After years of degredation, Scotland has increased its ambition in restoring these important areas. \u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Carbon sinks: How nature helps fight climate change", "article_name": "carbon-sinks-how-nature-helps-fight-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/carbon-sinks-how-nature-helps-fight-climate-change/a-59835700", "date_published": "2021-11-25 00:00:00", "article_length": 8680, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:09.117437"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Global warming isn't just an environmental problem \u2014 it will affect every aspect of human life. Our response has to be just a wide-reaching \u2014 and experts say people power can still save the planet. The world is getting hotter. That's clear to farmers whose crop\u00a0yields were hit by heat waves across southern Europe, Asia and the United States this summer. It's clear to hospital staff who struggled to cope with the physical effects of that heat on the human body. And to those who lost their homes in forest fires across southern Europe and the US . The weather has becomes a deadly force. Just ask the victims of the recent record-breaking hurricanes that swept the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico , and storm flooding that's increasingly inundating\u00a0tropical coastlines around the world. Yet in terms of human costs, these sudden, dramatic events pale in comparison to the droughts gripping large parts of East Africa, where aid agencies warn that 800,000 children are at risk of starvation. In these droughts, global temperature rise is undoubtedly a factor \u2014 and it can unleash a deadly chain of consequences, as food shortages contribute to mass migration and fuel conflict . In October, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research held a conference on climate change impacts, warning that \"if the climate is destabilized, it can destabilize society too. \"The consequences of global warming not only lead to economic damage \u2014they also damage human health, intensify the forces driving migration and threaten the prospects of development for the world's poorest.\" Maria wreaks havoc on Dominica, during this year's devastating Caribbean hurricane season Theory becomes a stark reality Climate scientist Wallace Broecker coined the term \"global warming in 1975,\" with a paper entitled\u00a0 Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming? How great the impact would be was then still unclear \u2014 and debated only among a relatively small community of scientists and activists.\u00a0 Four decades on, global warming has proved a very real ecological problem \u2014 as well as a health problem, a social problem, a political problem and an economic one. Climate change and its consequences have gone from a niche scientific concern to making daily headlines \u2014 and an unprecedented effort at global cooperation between nations. Next week, world leaders gather in Bonn, Germany , for the latest round of negotiations aimed at slowing the temperature rise and bracing for its consequences. It's coming on two years since the Paris Agreement was hailed as a breakthrough, with almost all the world's governments committing to cutting emissions. The agreement is a sign of how far we've come in recognizing the need to act. But there's still much to do. So far, the pledges made under the global agreement fall well short of keeping the global temperature rise below the agreed limit of 2 degrees Celsius. But to avert climate disaster, these conferences \u2014 including upcoming COP23 \u2014 are just part of the solution. Dale Jamieson,\u00a0professor of environmental studies and philosophy at New York University, warns against pinning the world's hopes on \"great men looking deeply into each others eyes in Bonn and committing the world to some alternative course of action.\" \"COP is not, for the most part, where things really happen,\" Jamieson said. The driving force\u00a0comes from democratic pressure on those \"great men\" and women, along with deeper changes in how we all think about the kind of world we want to live in. Local action leads the way In the case of the United States, the limited power of world leaders could be a godsend. After President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the climate agreement , cities and states across the country stepped up \u00a0and vowed to meet the targets regardless. And they are not alone. Local and state governments around the world have set their own emissions reductions targets and deadlines to give up coal \u2014 often more progressive than national ones. Energy efficiency, eco-friendly transport, social inclusion - many factors contribute to the sustainability of cities. Although they are not all easy to achieve, some urban centers have made bigger steps forward than others. In its annual State of the World report, the Worldwatch Institute highlights some cities that are striving to be more sustainable. Green space is particularly important to the people of Melbourne, Australia, where the city manages more than 480 hectares of park land. Over the past few decades, around 46 hectares of streets and parking lots have been converted into green space and the city hopes to be able to provide 20 square meters of open space per person. Time for a trip Down Under and don\u2019t forget your picnic blanket! China is the world's largest energy consumer and the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide - which is hardly a recipe for sustainability. And yet, at least one of its cities is trying to make a change. In Shanghai, use of coal is dropping, while non-fossil fuel energy is expected to rise to 12 percent by the end of 2015 - double that of 2010. The city is also home to China's first offshore wind farm. After taking the step of diverting car traffic from its center, Germany's university city of Freiburg had to find another way for students to make it to lectures. The answer? An extensive transit network, which means no residence is more than 300 meters from a tram or a bus stop. Green jobs, carbon neutral buildings and a focus on supporting the local food industry - the Canadian city Vancouver has a \"bright green future.\" In 2011, the city council approved the Greenest City 2020 Action Plan. Since then, the city has integrated policies with the hope they will bring it to an environmentally friendly future. Singapore is a world leader in desalination, and its national water strategy is just one of the factors that highlights Singapore's sustainability. Almost all urban rainwater is harvested and stored in drinking water reservoirs, while water pollution is also kept in check. Pune was the first Indian city to implement a bus rapid transit (BRT) pilot - much like this one in South Korea. The scheme uses dedicated bus lanes to promote ease of travel. The Rainbow BRT includes 30 kilometers of bus lanes, and serves more than 100,000 people. The first few months saw a 12 percent increase in the number of people hopping on the bus. Harmony between humans and nature is one of the things Barcelona is trying to achieve with its sustainability plan. The metropolitan area is home to more than 2,000 plant species, 28 mammal species and 184 types of birds, as well as reptiles, fish and more. Author: Louise Osborne Recently, cities including London, Los Angeles, Paris, Mexico City, Copenhagen, Barcelona, Vancouver and Cape Town committed to banning the combustion engine in at least parts of their urban landscapes. Robert Costanza, an ecological economist at the Crawford School of Public Policy in Australia, says \"that's where a lot of the action is going to be\" because \"local initiatives have major advantages.\" \"That's where the rubber meets the road \u2014 but also they can serve as models for other places to show the feasibility, the desirability, really of taking this alternative strategy,\" he says. From state-level political programs like California's rapid advance toward decarbonization , to \"transition towns\" where much smaller communities are experimenting with zero-waste and circular economies \u2014 localities can test an idea to be replicated elsewhere.\u00a0 Taking control of the future Yet while some experiment with radical news ways living, for many of us, it can be hard to connect to the fact that benign actions \u2014 like eating a hamburger or driving your kids to soccer practice \u2014 contribute to terrible environmental damage and loss of human life. And the problem can seem just too big and terrifying to fix. Costanza says we need radical change \u2013 away from a society obsessed with growth and consumption to one that lives within the means of a finite planet. But the good news is, the things we need to give up \u2014 power stations that foul up the air and the endless accumulation and wealth \u2014 aren't what make us happy anyway. You just bought a fancy lamp? Make it cooler with efficient lightbulbs. This is one of the small actions that make a difference in the long-term - and let's be honest, it's not a big effort. Some LED bulbs consume up to 90 percent less than traditional ones. In cold or rainy countries, the task might be challenging - but these challenges are nothing compared to the worst consequences of climate change. Recycling has become normal behavior for thousands of people around the world. It definitely contributes to making a better world - but unfortunately, it is not enough. Worried about your clothes shrinking in hot water? Here another reason to keep washing with cold water: Since it avoids turning on the water heater, cold-water washing also produces less greenhouse gas emissions. Until you are ready to get rid of your car completely, you could move to a hybrid electric car. But beware: The electricity that powers it is probably still coming from dirty fossil fuels. Beef production is the largest driver of tropical deforestation worldwide, with soy production closely following - mainly to feed animals. The carbon footprint of a meat-based diet is almost double that of a vegetarian one. Even reducing the amount of meat you eat makes a difference. Renewable energies are the new trend - but we are still largely dependent on fossil fuels such as coal. In countries like Germany, you can choose your energy provider - among some that draw from renewable sources. Air travel is a major challenge when it comes to tackling climate change. Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study. But if you start now with the other nine actions, your kids might be able to live in a better world. Author: Irene Banos Ruiz Rather than being motivated by fear, he counsels that we imagine the kind of future we want and work towards it as a positive goal. That's happening in a growing debate over an alternative to GDP as a measure of prosperity, a renewed interest in how indigenous communities use resources and a growing emphasis on the knowledge and sharing economies, which don't require huge inputs of material resources. These conversations are happening in tandem with campaigns like the divestment movement getting institutions to pull out of fossil fuel assets, the Atmospheric Trust which is suing for damage of the \"atmospheric commons\"\u00a0\u2014 and the public pressure put on leaders to get results in Bonn. Courage to act For all the positive signs that we're moving in the right direction, whether we can realize the world we want before it's too late remains to be seen. It depends both on how the climate responds, and how we as a global community act. \"Over the next 40 years or so, nature is going to play her cards \u2014 and the political systems and our cultural systems will either respond well, or they won't,\" said Peter Timmerman, associate professor of environmental studies at York University Toronto. Climate scientists point out that although we are still dealing with major uncertainties, we cannot rule out worst-case scenarios that conjure up a world of catastrophic weather , massive sea-level\u00a0rise, plague and war. Yet Timmerman says however dire our prospects look, we must act \u2014 even if out of blind faith. He says for him, the motivation is not fear. \"What motivates me is that I think this is the best planet ever. And there isn't going to be another really great one like this.\" Samuel is only 10 years old, but when it comes to describing how climate change will impact our planet, he has a clear answer: water will rise so much that people living near the sea will be begging for help to survive. But why does it happen? \"Because of the extreme pollution,\" he says. While Daniel (7) loves contemplating the sun, he wonders whether it will still be here in 50 years. He is hoping it only changes slightly, and that sunsets and sunrises will still be beautiful and colorful and will keep delighting adults and children. He's already urging his parents to recycle at home. After all, it's his future that's at stake. In a near future, flying cars will still be as polluting as cars nowadays, the sky will rarely look blue due to pollution, and humankind will completely forget the importance of nature - even the last of the trees will be removed. To top it off, droughts will be so bad in some places that ships will be stranded. And for that, Paloma (10) points out, we don't need to wait 50 years but only 15. Emma (7) has been traveling through southeast Asia in recent months and has loved the experience. But it was so hot! She learned from her mom that global temperatures are increasing every year. Therefore it's not surprising how she imagines the planet in the future: the sun will almost burn out and people will be forced to leave Earth \u2013 in rockets, of course. Life on another planet is exactly what Linus (12) imagines - more concretely, on Mars. In 50 years, the Earth will be immersed in such chaos that we will have to look for a better place. But even there, we will not have learned the lesson and we will leave another trail of consumption and destruction. Not much hope for our near future, right, Linus? \"Well, we can still stop it!\" In place of nature, technology will dominate our daily lives, Yann (12) believes. But for him, this is not discouraging, since we will have the most advanced technologies and lots of flying objects. This is how our planet will look in 50 years: a futuristic cityscape filled with revolutionary machines. Astrid (6) has a very abstract idea about Earth. It's a place where river flows, air flows and people are simultaneously affected by the same threat: a gigantic carbon \"handprint.\" Astrid has heard about it at school: the bigger the \"handprint,\" the worse the impact for us all. Our young artists don't always want to give a clear interpretation for their pieces. In this case, Miguel (10) provides us with two main options: The robot represents destructive climate change. Here, our destiny is quite clear. On the other hand, it may just mean that artificial intelligence will get out of control and become more powerful than humans. In any case, it's our time to act! At 7, Judith gets quite serious when talking about the future, and is convinced we might all be dead by 2067 - pets included. In half a century, almost no one will have survived planetary destruction: and aliens will get the chance to take over. Just in case, Judith already prefers to save precious resources. No more new sheets of paper for drawing unless she's first used the other side.  Author: Irene Banos Ruiz We are using up resources so fast the planet cannot keep up. A shift towards a circular economy, producing less or even no waste, could be the alternative - and countries like Scotland are moving in that direction. (15.02.2017)\n\u00a0 This year looks set to be among the hottest on record - no surprise to the southern Europeans sweltering out the \"Lucifer\" heat wave.

A UN report said the continent's glaciers could all melt by the 2040s. Mount Kenya (photo) is expected to be the first mountain range to lose glaciers due to human-induced climate change A new report from the United Nations\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0highlighted Africa's \"disproportionate vulnerability\" from food insecurity, poverty and population displacement\u00a0as a result of climate change .\u00a0 It comes ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, as the UN warned that extreme conditions \u00a0 could push\u00a0more\u00a0people to migrate away from the continent.\u00a0 Already, an estimated 1.2 million people were displaced by storms and\u00a0floods in 2020, nearly two and half times as many people who fled\u00a0their homes because of conflict in the same year. \u00a0 \"By 2030, it is estimated that up to 118 million extremely poor people will be  exposed to drought , floods and extreme heat in Africa, if adequate response measures are not put in place,\" said Josefa Leonel Correia Sacko, commissioner for rural economy and agriculture at the African Union Commission. According to the report, which was a joint effort with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the extremely poor are those who live on less than $1.90 (\u20ac1.63)\u00a0per day. \"In sub-Saharan Africa, climate change could further lower gross domestic product by up to 3% by 2050,\" Sacko said in the foreword to the report. Africa accounts for less than 4% of greenhouse gas emissions, but it has long been projected to be severely affected by climate change. Its croplands are already prone to drought, many of its major cities sit along the coast\u00a0and much of its population lives in widespread poverty. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said Africa saw temperatures continue to increase last year, \"accelerating sea-level rise,\"\u00a0as well as extreme weather events like floods, landslides and droughts, which are all indicators of climate change. The report forecast that at current rates all three of Africa's glaciers would be gone by the 2040s. \"The rapid shrinking of the last remaining glaciers in eastern Africa, which are expected to melt entirely in the near future, signals the threat of imminent and irreversible change to the Earth system,\" Taalas said. Last year, Africa's land mass and waters warmed more rapidly than the world average, the report said. \"If this continues, it will lead to total deglaciation by the 2040s,\" it added. In particular, Mount Kenya is expected to be deglaciated a decade sooner, which would make it \"one of the first entire mountain ranges to lose glaciers due to human-induced climate change,\" the report said. jcg/wd (Reuters, AFP, AP) \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "UN: Climate change threatens over 100 million people in Africa", "article_name": "un-climate-change-threatens-over-100-million-people-in-africa", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/un-climate-change-threatens-over-100-million-people-in-africa/a-59551093", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 2830, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:10.489041"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change and environmental issues are complicated. And if you have young children, it can be difficult to explain exactly what's going on. DW tries to answer some of the big questions. A lot of people are talking about climate change, and a lot of people are very worried about it. Children and grown-ups are protesting and you might hear some scary things about the future. People don\u2019t know yet how things will turn out in 10 years, 20 years or a 100 years from now. But there are things we can do. One of the most important things, is to understand what the problem is, how we all play a role in causing it \u2014 and how we can all play a role in solving it. 1. Why are so many children skipping school? Kids are worried. They're not happy that the adults in charge \u2014 those who should be making our lives better \u2014 seem to be ignoring the problem of climate change, or just not doing enough to stop the world from getting too hot. Students hope that by walking out of school with banners and megaphones , and getting together with other people who want things to change, that their voices will be heard. They want the politicians, those people who make the big decisions, to get together and come up with solutions to climate change and find a way to fix the damage we've done. World leaders met and agreed that they would do that. But so far, they haven't done enough to stop our planet from getting dangerously hot. 2. And what exactly is climate change? That's a tricky one. Plenty of adults don't understand a lot of the details about climate change. It's a problem caused by \"greenhouse gases.\" Thousands of students walked out of class in Sydney, kicking off global protests on Friday. They got the attention they wanted. Some Australian politicians hit back with criticism. \"For action on issues that they think is important, they should do that after school or on weekends,\" said Education Minister Dan Tehan. Protesters in New Zealand invited adults to join the march. \"If we go on strike on a school day, then they'll notice and they might want to do something,\" said 14-year-old student Inese, who didn't want to give her full name. And her prime minister is listening. Jacinda Ardern supports the strikes and has pledged NZ$100 million (\u20ac60 million/$68 million) to cut greenhouse gases. The movement has snowballed since 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg began skipping school to protest in front of parliament last August. On March 15, her protest spread from Vanuatu to Hong Kong (pictured here), Tashkent to Madagascar. In Thailand, one of the world's top plastic polluters, students campaigned against single-use plastics. From Seoul to Singapore, each city's students spoke out in their own way. Here in South Korea, 100 students held signs saying \"Too warm 4 school\" and \"Don't deny climate change.\" In Singapore, strict laws regulate public assembly so young people planned a virtual campaign on social media. In India, protests were seen in 36 different cities, including New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore. Students in New Delhi chanted slogans demanding the Indian government stop using coal and act against climate change and air pollution. While German Chancellor Angela Merkel has supported the movement, some German students are still afraid to skip school. But not all. Protests were planned for 200 cities across the country. In the German capital, the crowds were huge by midday. In the western German city of Cologne, students braved the wet weather. Massive storms have recently battered that part of the country, though they only appeared to fan the flames of the students' protest. Greta Thunberg (center) led one of the many protests in Sweden. She said she was excited that protests had spread to 2,052 places in 123 countries. Asked if adults should strike too, she replied: \"It's up to them, if they want their kids to have a future.\" Students in South African cities, including Cape Town and Pretoria, joined in the school strike. Africa, with more than 1 billion people, is expected to be hardest hit by global warming even though it contributes the least to greenhouse gas emissions. Strikes were held by students in cities across the country, including New York, Washington, Chicago, Portland, Oregon and St. Paul, Minnesota. In June 2017, US President Donald Trump announced that the US was withdrawing from the 2015 Paris agreement on mitigating climate change. Montreal drew among the largest crowds, estimated by organizers at nearly 150,000. The global movement saw a response from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who said he was inspired by the climate strikers to call a special summit in September to deal with \"the climate emergency.\" Author: Tom Allinson A greenhouse is made of glass that traps the sun's heat but doesn\u2019t let it back out again, so that inside, it gets hotter. The same thing happens with the Earth's atmosphere, which holds in the heat from the sun to keep us all nice and warm (out in space, we'd quickly freeze!). But gases that come from factories, power plants and cars and get into the atmosphere are making the planet too hot. Most of the energy we use to make things, keep the lights on and our homes warm, turn on the air-con and power transport, comes from burning fuels like oil, gas and coal. These are called fossil fuels and when they are burned, they release carbon. Once carbon\u00a0gets into the atmosphere, it traps a lot of heat. \u00a0 Cutting down trees can also make the world hotter, because trees take carbon out of the atmosphere and store it safely away. Read more:\u00a0 Coping with climate anxiety on a warming planet When the planet gets hotter, how the weather changes is different from place to place \u2014 and hard to predict. You may have heard older people talk about how winters used to be snowy, or seen pictures of melting glaciers. In some places, deserts are getting bigger and in summer it can be too hot to go outside. But in other parts of the world it can actually get colder, rainier or more stormy: For example, when the glaciers melt, all that icy water goes into the sea, making it colder, changing the flows of water and air \u2014 and the weather. And when it gets hot, more water evaporates, making more rain. 3. Is the world going to end? No \u2014 planet Earth is about 4.5 billion years old and it has been through lots of changes, getting hotter and colder at different times. But the animals and plants that live here now like the climate just the way it is. If it changes too much, many will die. Unusual weather \u2014 too much rain or not enough, huge storms , hotter summers , forest fires \u00a0and floods \u2014 is also making it harder to grow the food we eat every day. In some places, there isn't enough food and water . Climate change could mean more people will become sick . And some people have to leave their homes and look for a safer place to live, sometimes far away in another country. To stop the world getting too hot, we have to change the way we live. People are comfortable living their lives a certain way, getting around in gas-powered cars and airplanes and finding everything they want in stores, and they may fear giving up that way of life. 4. But what does that have to with me?\u00a0 Pollution can come from many things; nearly everything we do in our daily life has an effect on the climate. That's why we're trying to fly less, reuse our shopping bags and buy fewer things, or get our food from the farms closer to home. Read more: \u00a0 Net-zero by 2050: What does it mean? Think about plastic water bottles. Before they show up in the store, somebody has to make the bottle, fill it with water and move it to the store by truck. And then, once we're done with it, we usually just get rid of it right away \u2014 by recycling, when we can, or just tossing it in the trash. All that has an effect on the planet, by creating more pollution in the air, using up fresh water and making more garbage. You just bought a fancy lamp? Make it cooler with efficient lightbulbs. This is one of the small actions that make a difference in the long-term - and let's be honest, it's not a big effort. Some LED bulbs consume up to 90 percent less than traditional ones.

Until you are ready to get rid of your car completely, you could move to a hybrid electric car. But beware: The electricity that powers it is probably still coming from dirty fossil fuels. Beef production is the largest driver of tropical deforestation worldwide, with soy production closely following - mainly to feed animals. The carbon footprint of a meat-based diet is almost double that of a vegetarian one. Even reducing the amount of meat you eat makes a difference. Renewable energies are the new trend - but we are still largely dependent on fossil fuels such as coal. In countries like Germany, you can choose your energy provider - among some that draw from renewable sources. Air travel is a major challenge when it comes to tackling climate change. Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study. But if you start now with the other nine actions, your kids might be able to live in a better world. Author: Irene Banos Ruiz 5. So what can I do to help? We can make small contributions, like remembering to turn off the lights when we leave a room, eating less meat and composting our garbage. We can also walk places or go by bike, or go on vacations closer to home so we can take the train, which uses less energy and makes less pollution than a plane.

And while our choices alone aren't enough to fix the problem, they can help to convince companies and politicians to make bigger changes. Just by asking these questions \u2014 and learning from books or from interesting TV and movies \u2014 and talking about climate change and the environment with other people in your life, you're helping to spread the message. And the more that people know about the problem, the better chance we have of doing something about it.

{"id": null, "body": "     Plastic, as we know, is everywhere. In waterways, in animals, even in our food. As if that isn't bad enough, a new report shows it's also accelerating global warming. Stopping climate change also means curbing plastic. People are more aware than ever that plastic \u2014 one of the most ubiquitous products in the global economy \u2014 is not good for the environment. It trashes the ocean,\u00a0harms wildlife and even ends up in our food and hurts human health. But here is something you might not know: the plastic industry is the second largest and fastest-growing source of industrial greenhouse gas emissions,\u00a0and 99% of what goes into plastic is derived from fossil fuels. It's a byproduct of oil, coal and gas and a key contributor to CO2 emissions, as highlighted in a new report from the Center of International Environmental Law (CIEL). \u00a0 If the expansion of petrochemical and plastics production continues as currently planned, the report outlines that by 2050 plastic will be responsible for 10 to 13% of the total \"carbon budget\"\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which is the amount of CO2 we can emit globally and still remain below a 1.5 degree Celsius temperature rise. Read more: \u00a0 Emissions and microplastics: How food waste hurts the environment Plastic's hastening of global warming is not often linked to its environmental footprint. Here are five\u00a0things to know about the role plastic plays in climate change. 1. Most plastic comes from fossil fuels Plastics are effectively a byproduct of fossil fuel extraction. Almost all plastic, the CIEL researchers found, \u2014\u00a0including resins, fibers and additives \u2014\u00a0is derived from fossil fuels. The materials used to make plastic, like ethylene and propylene, come from oil, gas and coal. As\u00a0Carroll Muffett, lead author of the CIEL report, points out, producing plastic is how the fossil fuel industry is able to \"take\u00a0what would otherwise be a waste stream and turn\u00a0it into a profit stream.\"\u00a0 2. Production, usage, disposal: all add greenhouse gases Each stage in the \"plastic life-cycle\"\u00a0produces greenhouse gas emissions, the\u00a0researchers found. This includes: the extraction and transportation of fossil fuels used to formulate plastic, its refinement and manufacture, the management of plastic waste and its disposal.\u00a0 In 2019 alone, researchers estimate\u00a0that the production and incineration of plastic will contribute more than 850 million tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Incineration is particularly harmful, and is the number one driver of emissions from plastic waste management.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0 Warning: Smoking kills you \u2014 and the planet \u00a0 Over the next 10 years, the report projected that emissions from the plastics lifecycle could reach 1.34 gigatons per year \u2014\u00a0equivalent to the emissions from more than 295 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants operating at full capacity. 3. Production is actually increasing Although in Germany, for example, plastic production decreased by 3.1%\u00a0in 2018 (mostly due to a slump in the demand for cars)\u00a0and parts of the world have introduced plastic bans ,\u00a0it's on the rise worldwide. Part of the reason for this is that many of the companies that manufacture plastic resins are the same companies that manufacture oil and gas: Mobil, Shell, Chevron, and Total, for example. That the oil industry is propping up plastics at a time when the world is slowly phasing out fossil fuel-powered energy\u00a0is no coincidence, Muffett points out. \"A\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bs\u00a0they see the world moving away from an energy economy based on oil and gas,\u00a0these companies\u00a0are increasingly relying on a shift into plastics and other petrochemicals for their long-term business strength,\" he told DW.\u00a0 Incineration is the number one driver of greenhouse gas emissions from plastic waste management And although the UN has just introduced global rules to stop unrestricted plastic waste exports , which Muffett says will\u00a0make it harder for many countries to hide their plastic waste problem, he adds there is still a lot of room for removing unnecessary plastic from people's lives in the first place. 4. Plastic litter could impact the oceanic carbon sink By now, plastic is virtually inescapable throughout every corner of the globe. It's now been found in the deepest place on earth \u2014 the Mariana Trench\u00a0\u2014\u00a0on the deepest dive ever made by a human inside a submarine, nearly 11 kilometers (about 7 miles) below sea level. And early research shows\u00a0it\u00a0could have an impact on the oceanic carbon sink. There's increasing evidence, the\u00a0CIEL researchers found, of\u00a0microplastic being consumed by\u00a0plankton. These creatures\u00a0not only \"form the base of the oceanic carbon chains,\" but also provide the \"single most important mechanism for absorbing atmospheric carbon and transporting it to deep-ocean carbon sinks,\" the report said. The world's oceans provide the largest natural carbon sink for greenhouse gases, having absorbed\u00a030-50 percent of atmospheric CO2 produced since the start of the industrial era. If microplastics were to disrupt\u00a0the ability for underwater ecosystems to absorb carbon, it could seriously compromise efforts to stop global warming.\u00a0 Despite total plastic waste bans in some countries, plastic production is on the rise worldwide 5. 'We can't recycle our way out of the plastic crisis' The production and proliferation of plastic is deeply industrialized. It's cheap, sturdy\u00a0and lightweight, and has transformed the way we consume. That's why eliminating plastic requires some big changes. Rick Stafford, professor of marine biology from the University of Bournemouth, says\u00a0battling climate change and the plastic crisis requires a re-thinking of the capitalist mindset of\u00a0overconsumption. \"We're using too much, whether that's fossil fuels or whether that's just stuff which is made out of plastic. And that's a change more people will have to grasp,\" he told DW.\u00a0 But as Muffett points out, plastic is also a robust business model for big corporations. This doesn't mean there is no point in trying to cut down the plastics we use on a daily basis\u00a0\u2014 the CIEL report lists zero-waste communities as a high-impact strategy to stop plastic's climate change affect\u00a0\u2014 but it does require change on an industrial scale.\u00a0 \"We encourage people to do what you can to get unnecessary plastics out of your own lives, but don't be fooled that those individual actions alone will be sufficient to address this problem.\"\u00a0 We won't\u00a0\"be able to recycle our way out of the plastics crisis,\"\u00a0Muffett said. In fact, the only way to address the plastic crisis, he adds, \"is to A) stop producing the fossil fuels that are the primary feedstocks for plastic and B) to stop producing single use disposable plastics that we don't need.\" Giant petrochemical companies have announced a wealthy alliance to tackle plastic pollution. But there's little talk of scaling back production to help the environment.

{"id": null, "body": "     Greenhouse gas emissions are increasing and with it the danger of global catastrophes. That's the bad news in the new report from UN climate change panel, the IPCC. The good news? There's still hope - for a limited time. In spite of all efforts, the global community has not been successful in reducing its climate-damaging carbon dioxide emissions. Quite the opposite: emissions of greenhouse gases between the years 2000 and 2010 grew more than in any decade since 1970. The findings are part of the newest report from the United Nations' expert Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has been released in Berlin. In spite of the dire outlook, the authors have named their report \"Mitigation of Climate Change\". With that, the authors, including German scientist Ottmar Edenhofer, wanted to emphasize that it was still possible to turn the situation around. The analysis and recommendations for action , which have now been submitted to politicians, are the third part of a comprehensive account on climate change. The first part was made public in Stockholm last year, the second report a few weeks ago in Yokohama. According to the international team of authors, a mix of political and technical measures is needed to limit the increase in global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius. In the view of the climate experts, more severe natural disasters like floods and droughts, which are already being noticed today, could be confined only if the threshold level of two degrees is not overstepped. \"The scientific message is clear: to avoid dangerous disturbances to the climate system, we can\u2019t go on as we have done before,\" climate researcher Edenhofer said.  A minimum 40-percent reduction in CO2 by 2050 The goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures to no more than two degrees Celsius will only be reachable if greenhouse gases emissions can be reduced by 40 to 70 percent in comparison with 2010 by the middle of this century, according to the experts of the IPCC. They've said that for a livable future to remain possible for people and the environment, there should be almost no further greenhouse gases emissions by the end of the 21st century. Climate scientist Ottmar Edenhofer says action must be taken quickly to mitigate climate change To achieve such an ambitious mitigation of climate change, the experts recognize that it has to involve more than the sheer reduction of CO2 output. Ottmar Edenhofer, along with Cuban Ramon Pichs-Madruga and Youba Sokona from Mali also see a carbon dioxide free atmosphere as essential.  The three authors leave no doubt that the world community must quickly take action on a wide range of measures if it wants to restrict dramatic global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius. The process begins with the modest goal of stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases, so as not to let them increase any more. In the opinion of the climate experts, to succeed in that would mean the concurrent reduction of emissions in all areas of economic and personal life, foremost the production and the use of energy, the manufacture of consumer goods and food, transport and living.  The key to success: international cooperation The scientists see much potential in the areas of energy efficiency and re-forestation. Low-carbon technologies could work out beneficially in terms of costs, which must be spent to reduce climate change, explained Pichs-Madruga. The economical and considerate exploitation of land areas is a further key component. Reducing deforestation and at the same time planting new trees could, according to the scientists, stop the rise of CO2 emissions or even reverse them. Even more, through well-directed re-forestation, the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could be reduced.  The scientists pledge the same effect from a combination of biomass and the storing of carbon dioxide underground. However, they also advise of the hazards of such procedures. Malian climate expert Sokona summed up the core challenge as \"to disconnect the output of greenhouse gases from economic and population growth\". His German colleague Edenhofer added that \"international cooperation is the key to mitigate global warming.\"  NGOs focus on the obligations of politicians  Many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) hold the same opinion. Sabine Minninger, climate and energy expert from the German-based Christian relief and development network \"Brot f\u00fcr die Welt\" (\"Bread for the World\") expects Germany to take a leading role, saying that Chancellor Angela Merkel now has the possibility to show September's United Nations Climate Change Summit in New York \"that she has understood the message from the IPCC.\" What the German government makes of the recommendations will be up to the Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, to comment on at a presentation in Berlin on Monday.

Europe continues to struggle with a heat wave, though some have seen a respite from record high temperatures for the time of year. One of several wildfires has raged out of control on Greece's second-largest island. Several Western European countries are facing a sweltering weekend as summer arrives early. Much of Spain, France and Italy have been put on high alert for wildfires. The war in Ukraine is worsening food insecurity in East Africa after a devastating locust invasion, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing drought. In Somalia alone, 6 million people are food insecure.

With less than 10 years left to avert climate catastrophe, campaigners Kumi Naidoo and Luisa Neubauer say activists need to ramp up civil disobedience. Australia has felt severe impacts from climate change in recent years, but until now had been well behind most other industrialized nations in its climate protection pledges.

{"id": null, "body": "     Planting a massive number of trees is the most effective way to combat global warming, scientists have said. Reforesting an area the size of the United States could capture two-thirds of manmade carbon emissions. A report from Swiss scientists published on Thursday said an effective way to stem the catastrophic consequences of climate change would be to plant about 1 trillion trees. This would take up an area roughly the size of the United States, but there is more than enough room, according to the study published in the journal Science. \"Every other climate change solution requires that we all change our behavior, or we need some top-down decision from a politician who may or may not believe in climate change, or it's a scientific discovery we don't yet have,\" researcher Tom Crowther told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\u00a0\"This one is not only our most powerful solution \u2014\u00a0it's one that every single one of us can get involved with.\" Over decades, the growing trees could suck up nearly 830 billion tons (750 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to the study. That's about as much carbon pollution as humans have spewed in the past 25 years. Crowther\u00a0added, however, that while this was a cheap solution, it would not work without emissions cuts. Researchers emphasized that there are also behavioral changes that would work faster, such as cutting animal products out of one's diet. The report noted that the countries with the most room for the trees are Russia, Canada, the United States, Australia, Brazil, and China. Brazil has been the site of some of\u00a0 devastating deforestation in the world in recent decades. The benefits of this solution would also be seen relatively quickly as trees remove more carbon from the air the younger they are. Planting trees will also help stop the loss of biodiversity occurring all around the world and prevent natural disasters such as floods. Some scientists not involved with the study expressed skepticism about the findings. \"Restoration of trees may be 'among the most effective strategies,' but it is very far indeed from 'the best climate change solution available,' and a long way behind reducing fossil fuel emissions to net zero,\" said Myles Allen, a geosystem science professor at Oxford, the AFP news agency reported. \"Yes, heroic reforestation can help, but it is time to stop suggesting there is a 'nature-based solution' to ongoing fossil fuel use.

The Russian-occupied region has a wine history that dates back to Czar Nicholas II. Benefiting from the mild climate of the Black Sea, Massandra Madeira is said to have been served at the Yalta conference in 1945. Or so we hear through the grapevine. Russia's Belgorod Oblast dates its affinity for wine back to the late Middle Ages, claiming that Turks and Tatars first noted the fact that the region would lend itself to growing grapes. In the 19th century, French settlers arrived to help cultivate grapes bringing their know-how from Bordeaux and Burgundy with them. You can clearly ditch your Russian vodka for wine here. In Siberia, which has a reputation for permafrost, there's a long tradition of people harvesting and fermenting grapes. In 2009, a local family decided to take this to the next level, cultivating wine on an industrial scale to produce the first Siberian wine for a mass market. Their two main grapes, Pinot Noir and Muscat, are harvested on an area of eight hectares, producing 50,000 bottles a year. \nAuthor: Sertan Sanderson\n According to Roman legend, Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, traveled as far as India to learn everything about the craft of harvesting grapes. Today, however, such tropical climates can increasingly be found in the least expected of places, allowing oenophiles\u00a0to sample grapes from such atypical places as Scandinavia and Siberia. The main reason for this change is global warming, which is not only challenging farmers in Europe's traditional wine regions to seek ways to make their harvest more heat and drought-resistant, but is meanwhile also moving the Arctic tree line farther north in general. In other words, people are increasingly using previously barren land to try their luck at agriculture, including the cultivation of grapes. The United Nations has even predicted that viticulture as a whole in the Northern Hemisphere might move an average of up to 111 miles (180 kilometers) farther\u00a0north compared to where grapes are growing now. If this trend continues, it could spell financial ruin to long-established wine businesses, while presently less likely areas could economically benefit from diversifying into the wine market. And indeed, this trend is already manifesting in places like southern England, Sweden and Canada, where vineyards are popping up, winemakers are trying new varietals and methods\u00a0and the traditional wine industry is beginning to notice some steep competition.\u00a0 Old wine in new bottles While wine growers in places like southern France, the Iberian Peninsula or even in South Africa are nervously biting their nails while trying to adapt to a climate-changed future \u2014 for instance by planting more resistant grape varietals or using slopes they had not previously considered to provide a suitable terroir for growing grapes \u2014 newcomers in the wine business elsewhere are slowly perfecting the growing of vines in previously ignored and neglected regions. Areas that previously were at best an afterthought are suddenly beginning to make waves. There's even an annual wine award for \"Cool Climate Wines\" established by the Polish Czas Wina \u00a0wine magazine in 2004. While there are hardly any truly Nordic nations among their 2019 winners' list, the competition does feature bottles from less likely wine regions such as Romania, Poland, the Czech Republic and several German wines. In the US, wines from northern states like Minnesota or South Dakota are beginning to draw the attention away from the American wine staple of Napa Valley. Even in Germany, where traditional wine regions like the Moselle and the Ahr valley have a long-standing tradition for white wine, red grapes are also being introduced into the mix. Meanwhile, new vineyards keep springing up in unexpected and positively northern parts of the country as well, such as the North Frisian island of F\u00f6hr, which borders Denmark, or in the Uckermark\u00a0region, 100 kilometers (62 miles)\u00a0northeast of\u00a0Berlin. And even Scandinavian nations and Russia look as if they're on track to\u00a0swap\u00a0their vodkas for Viognier. That's climate change in a bottle.

Wine regions which thus far were ignored are beginning to realize their stock is rising, as global warming is changing viticulture.

{"id": null, "body": "     In Germany, some like it hot \u2014 this summer's unusually hot, sunny weather, that is. For many farmers, the prolonged heat means smaller harvests and diminished food reserves for their livestock. Will food prices soar? \"What we are experiencing this summer is climate change in action,\" says Gerald Dohme, the deputy chair of the German Farmers' Association. He says the lack of rain in Germany will mean a wheat harvest of just 41 million tons. This would be 4.5 tons less than last year's already subaverage harvest of 45.5 million\u00a0tons. Over the past five years, the average harvest has yielded 47.9 tons of wheat.\u00a0 According to Dohme, German farmers are extremely concerned \u2014 including those who farm livestock. He said\u00a0grass and maize used to feed animals was already running low and some unripe wheat had to be cut down in certain parts of Germany. Read also:  Do we really need next-gen GMOs to feed the world? Though many crops have withered, orchard harvests have been bountiful Northern and eastern Germany received considerable\u00a0sunshine in spring and summer this year, which caused drought-related damages. Similarly, in the southeastern state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, drought destroyed numerous crops, but the weather varied considerably\u00a0throughout the country.\u00a0\"Some farms reported droughts while farmers merely two kilometers away said they were struggling with the effects of extreme rainfall,\" Dohm explains.\u00a0 While wheat farmers have taken a hit, German fruit farmers are doing well. They are reaping a substantial, albeit early harvest. Some have even begun harvesting their fruit as early as their Mediterranean peers. April and May were the hottest months since weather records began . What does this mean\u00a0for consumer prices? Dohme is not worried, but\u00a0admits that a drop in agricultural products drives up prices. But wheat prices have little impact on the cost of bread, he says:\u00a0\"It changes only by a few cents.\" In terms of availability, Dohme claims\u00a0says consumers need not worry, because international trade will balance things out:\u00a0\"There are different kind of harvest situations across Europe, despite the hot summer.\" Read also:  How to prevent cooling from warming up the world Cows have little to graze upon in this drought-stricken field in the German state of Saxony German state considering financial assistance Nina Wettern, of Germany's Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), argues farmers need to take action now. \"We need to assist the agricultural sector adapt to climate change.\" She says that seeking the greatest possible harvest at all cost is untenable. EU funding that supports large-scale farms does little to help, she adds. But Wettern acknowledges that farmers are under immense pressure. \"Apart from dealing with the capricious weather, they have to meet environmental standards like the new fertilizer law.\" In general, the government offers farmers help when it comes to installing better cooling systems, choosing new methods of cultivation, and selecting crops more suited to climate change, Wettern says.\u00a0 But none of this will mollify farmers who are already facing major financial losses due to the usually hot weather. Dohme has now called for these farmers to be granted tax relief. The German Farmers'\u0080 Association has also joined forces\u00a0with insurers to develop schemes\u00a0provide financial protection beyond damages incurred through hail. In one month, the BMU plans to meet representatives from Germany's federal states to assess the situation. Whether financial help will be granted will be decided in August, when the harvest report is published, the BMU said. The challenge of feeding a planet that\u2019s set to have 3 billion more people on it by 2050 - made even more acute by climate change as some parts of the planet become wetter, while others drier - means the pressure is on to find ways to feed the planet. So farming has to become more productive \u2013 and new areas to grow, especially in dry climates, must be found. One potential solution: hydroponics. Farming with little space and producing higher crop yields: hydroponics fits the bill. Though it may sound like something out of Star Trek, it's actually been around since the Aztecs \u2013 they built floating farms around the city of Tenochtitlan. Hydroponics essentially means growing plants without soil, and instead using a nutrient-rich solution to supply them with water and minerals. With hydroponics, plants \u2013 usually supported by soil \u2013 are propped up artificially instead, and a nutrient solution is applied to the suspended roots using a number of different methods, including spraying them with a solution mist. Together with artificial lights, heaters and other equipment, the nutrient solutions help plants develop faster, produce larger yields and grow all year round. Hydroponics can recycle water, meaning it could use as little as 10 percent of the water a conventional farm uses \u2013 making it an option in arid environments. And the closed system means nutrients don't escape, cutting fertilizer down to as much as a quarter of what a conventional farm would use. Also, almost no pesticide is needed, since soil pests aren't an issue for plants grown without soil. When growing sideways isn't an option, try going upwards: hydroponic growing trays can be piled on top of one another, and plants can be grown more closely next to each than in the soil, making it very efficient in terms of space. As for what kind of space they can grow in, the sky is the limit: with no need for scarce farmland, one possibility could be to have hydroponic farms in skyscrapers. Running a hydroponic farm can be complex, energy-intensive and expensive. Plants require many essential nutrients, and the farm needs a large amount of equipment. Heat and light, supplied for free by the sun in conventional farms, have to be provided artifically and paid for. And power failures could mean whole crops are destroyed if they go too long without water and light. Hydroponics can theoretically be used to grow any crop, although the technique lends itself best to plants such as cucumbers, salad greens, tomatoes, peppers and herbs. Given its long history, hydroponics still isn't widely used. But that looks set to change: the global hydroponic farming industry was estimated to be worth $21.2 billion in 2016. That's forecast to grow by 7 per cent each year.

The six Booker Prize nominated books This year's shortlisted nominations for the Booker Prize are unafraid to take on today's real-world challenges, from climate change to poverty. \"The best novels often prepare our societies for valuable conversations, and not just about the inequities and dilemmas of the world \u2014 whether in connection with climate change, forgotten communities, old age, racism, or revolution when necessary \u2014 but also about how magnificent the interior life of the mind, imagination and spirit is, in spite of circumstance\" said judge Margaret Busby in a published announcement.\u00a0 The panel of five judges highlighted both the gender and racial diversity in their selection of novelists: \"It's exciting to realize there are so many interesting female authors out there; there are so many interesting non-white authors out there giving us different glimpses of what the world is all about, telling interesting and vibrant stories,\" said judge Emily Wilson in a video announcing the shortlist.\u00a0 Four of the six authors selected are women, including Zimbabwean author Tsitsi Dangarembga, whose book This Mournable Body \u00a0tells the tale of a woman confronting the harsh realities of life as she descends into poverty in Zimbabwe.\u00a0 Dangarembga herself is an activist as well as one of her country's top literary voices. She was arrested at the end of July\u00a0for protesting against the country's government and brings this fresh and fearless voice to her writing.\u00a0 Also on the list is Ethiopian-US writer Maaza Mengiste's The Shadow King ; a powerful story about African women who went to war during Italy's invasion of Ethiopia that sheds a new light on female empowerment. \u00a0 Also on the shortlist is Diane Cook's The New Wilderness , which is set in a dystopian future city rendered nearly uninhabitable due to smog and pollution. In it, a mother tries to save her daughter by moving to a wild land untouched by humankind. It is the kind of story that rings true in an era of rampant climate change, pointed out the jury. \u00a0 The judges selected another poignant mother daughter story, albeit with many twists and turns, in American author Avni Doshi's Burnt Sugar .\u00a0 Another finalist vying for the prize is Real Life by African-American author Brandon Taylor.

{"id": null, "body": "     Peru is being hit by devastating flooding. Is it a natural weather cycle or an impact of climate change? DW: What is causing the extremely heavy rainfall in Peru? Mojib Latif:\u00a0 Extremely warm water off Peru. It could be regarded as a kind of coastal el Nino event. El Ninos are events that are characterized by enormously high sea surface temperatures. So what is the difference between a coastal El Nino and an ordinary El Nino? Ordinary El Ninos basically cover most of the tropical Pacific and have global impacts. Coastal El Ninos have\u00a0regional impacts and are restricted to the coast. So are we just talking about a natural development here? We don't really know whether this is natural. It is unusual that after a big El Nino - and the last one was in 2015/2016 - that there is another El Nino happening. We have to see now whether this develops into a full-blown El Nino, which then would also have global impacts. But once again\u00a0it's unusual that we have flooding in Peru, again, within two years. Some experts have been saying the last similar event was nearly a century ago in 1925? Yes. Data is limited, but we can't exclude that.\u00a0It's not unprecedented\u00a0but the point here is that normally El Ninos develop at a different time of year. They are called El Ninos because, if we translate this into English, it means the Christmas child. Now we are seeing an El Nino developing in March. Sea temperatures off the coast of Peru are slowly warming. So\u00a0the question is whether or not global impacts are having an influence here on the climate of South America. What we can say is that El Ninos have become more frequent and also stronger\u00a0in recent decades.\u00a0Whether this is already a trend or not\u00a0is hard to say but some climate models actually project that this is exactly what's going to happen in response to climate change. The flooding has caused widespread damage and loss of lives. So the seawater is extremely warm for this time of year. The ocean worldwide has been warming. Is this possible without any human interference in the form of CO2 emissions? No, absolutely not. You can't explain the warming of the oceans without taking into account anthropogenic (human-caused) carbon dioxide emissions. The oceans are warm down to 2,000 meters, and that is a giant volume. Actually, the oceans have taken more than 90 percent of the heat that has been trapped in the earth's system in response to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. This ocean warming also leads to a sea level rise. So about half of the sea level rise\u00a0we have observed over\u00a0the last century is actually due to ocean warming due to thermal expansion. At some point, this warming also becomes dangerous to our marine ecosystems.\u00a0 Corals, for instance, don't have very great temperature tolerance. So if the oceans warm by more then 1.5 degrees Celsius or so, they would probably die. And it's possible that all tropical corals without climate protection will be gone by the middle of the century. That sounds pretty devastating. Do we underestimate the ocean in our climate discussion? Yes absolutely, not only with regard to our climate but also with regard to food security. Millions of people depend directly or indirectly on the oceans. We are absolutely not valuing the oceans as we should. Life ultimately depends on the well-being of our\u00a0oceans. This heat will stay in the ocean for centuries.\u00a0 So even if we don't emit any more greenhouse gases, this heat is still present and it will slowly escape from the ocean. And this is basically why global warming will continue even if we don't really emit any greenhouse gases any more. Latif remains hopeful about halting climate change. Critics say that in Peru the authorities should have been better prepared. Is it possible to foresee this sort of thing\u00a0and what kind of preparations could they make? In principle yes, but this only concerns real or \"ordinary\u00a0El Ninos\".\u00a0 But I think in general as climate extremes become more frequent and more extreme you can also expect that we will become more vulnerable. I think since we know that we are living in a changing world, we have to take more precautions so that we are better prepared than we are now. At the G20 meeting in Germany last week, climate change wasn't even mentioned in the final communiqu\u00e9 after pressure from the USA. How do you interpret that? This is a difficult time:\u00a0democracy is under pressure;\u00a0freedom is under pressure. And then environmental issues don't get the attention they deserve. The climate issue is now on the table for decades. But international politics haven't been able to cope with the problem. So if we just look at the carbon dioxide emissions since 1990 for instance, they have increased by more than 60 percent globally. We know that there is a climate change problem. And I think more or less - except maybe now in the United States -\u00a0governments agree with\u00a0this. This was the reason why they all signed the Paris agreement in 2015.\u00a0 But when it comes to action, we fail. In fact we don't seem to be on track to meet the targets set out in the Paris climate agreement of limiting global temperature rise to two degrees or even one point five. So are you optimistic? Well, that's the only way you can live\u00a0these days. I think I'm optimistic because you know the renewable energies, for instance, are so superior to coal,\u00a0gas or oil. You know that the renewables will prevail at some point,\u00a0and I hope they will prevail in time, so that we don't really need any more political negotiations. Then things may happen faster than we have anticipated. Mojib Latif is a professor of oceanology and climate dynamics at GEOMAR, the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in\u00a0Kiel, Germany.

Read more :\u00a0 Nations backslide on climate protection promises Raising awareness of climate change through comics \u2014 that's the goal of Zambian cartoonist Mwelwa Musonko, founder of Foresight Comics. His work includes cartoons on Germany's energy transition, drawn in 2018 while on the International Journalists' Programme (IJP). This cartoon looks at the focus on immigration in Germany and Europe \u2014 ignoring the \"elephant in the room\" that is climate change. In another cartoon, Mwelwa's pen takes aim at how the world's meat and dairy sector is heating up the planet. Drawn while on a placement at Clean Energy Wire in Germany as part of the IJP, it followed a report from the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and GRAIN in 2018 that said the world's livestock industry could eat up 80 percent of the globe's allowable carbon budget by 2050. Mwelwa, aka \"Tax,\" also gave his take on Germans' attitudes to the energy transition. This came on the back of surveys suggesting that while Germans support a switch to renewables in principal, they're less keen on the costs that come with it. The artist told DW that cartoons are a great way to communicate the dangers of climate change, saying: \"Art is a perfect way of getting a message through.\" This cartoon was inspired by data showing Germans are reluctant to say goodbye to their petrol and diesel cars in exchange for an electric vehicle, despite the government offering a \u20ac4,000 ($4,676) subsidy per car. Two years after Germany launched the subsidy scheme, only one-sixth of the earmarked funds have been used, said a report from the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control. Germany's lignite mines also got Mwelwa's satirical treatment in this cartoon. Lignite, or brown coal, is extracted using opencast mining in Germany and it made up around 23 percent of the country's power production in 2017, according to AG Energiebilanzen (Energy Balances Group). Lignite-burning power stations are high on the list of Europe's largest CO2 producers. In 2018, Mwelwa came up with a unique way to raise climate change awareness by launching a comic book series. The Fifth Element follows the adventures of superhero Quin Ence, a 10th grader in Lusaka, Zambia, as she battles to save the planet from global warming. He told DW he created the series over concerns that \"the majority of Zambians think that climate change is a foreign problem.\" Mwelwa hopes the comics will raise awareness of climate change among children and teens \u2014 using eye-catching cartoons to overcome what he calls an aversion to reading in Zambia. \"The reading culture where I am from in Zambia is really, really bad,\" he told DW. \"So, if you would give somebody a book with pictures in it, I think it sparks their interest. Trying to create value with this art.\" Mwelwa decided to make his superhero a girl because it \"brings a different thing to the table,\" telling DW that comic book writers are increasingly talking about creating more female characters. He added: \"If you follow my comic book, you start to see that this character is not perfect. Her life is miserable, and she rises above all of that to save the world and fight climate change.\" Author: Melanie Hall 'Wildly alarming' The final draft of the report contains over 6,000 cited peer-reviewed studies, while expert reviews of the second draft attracted almost 25,000 comments from experts and officials from 71 countries. With a 1.5 degree temperature rise already enough to sow climate chaos, drafts of the report have confirmed the need to cap a global temperature rise at \"well-below\" 2 degrees, as mandated by the landmark Paris deal. \"I don't know how you can possibly read this and find it anything other than wildly alarming,\" Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington-based research and advocacy group, told AFP about the draft.\u00a0\u00a0 Nonetheless, the IPCC warned in January that meeting the 1.5 degree goal was \"extremely unlikely.\" \u00a0 Read more :\u00a0 Opinion: Goodbye to an unrealistic climate goal Trump wild card One report author warned that major fossil fuel producers such as Saudi Arabia have \"threatened to be obstructionist.\" But the fact that this the first IPCC report to be considered by the Trump administration \u2014 which pulled the US from the Paris Agreement in 2017 \u2014 is also a \"a real wild card,\" Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University and IPCC author, told AFP. \"Never in the history of the IPCC has there been a report that is so politically charged,\" said Henri Waisman, a senior researcher at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations, and one of the report's 86 authors.

The IPCC will release the summary for policymakers\u00a0of its 1.5 degree Celsius\u00a0report at a press conference on October 8.\u00a0The report will be available for the next UN climate summit, which takes place in December in Katowice, Poland. sb (AFP, dpa) The \"worst deal ever\": That's how Donald Trump described the 2015 landmark agreement that lifted international sanctions against Iran in exchange for the country dismantling its atomic program. In May 2018 the president followed through on a campaign promise and said he would withdraw the US from the deal, which had arisen out of painstaking multi-year negotiations. In February 2016 then-US President Barack Obama signed the free trade agreement known as the TPP along with 11 other Pacific nations. However, it never went into effect: Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that took the US out of the deal, thus keeping it from entering into force. The scuttled TPP evolved into a new regional trade partnership \u2014 without the US. The Paris climate accord was adopted in December 2015 after the COP 21 meeting. All 195 participating member states and the EU agreed to reduce emissions, decrease carbon output and try to rein in global warming. The US signed the accord but support was short-lived: in November 2017 Trump told the UN that the US would withdrawal from the accord at the earliest possible date, November 2019. Trump not only has undone US participation in international climate deals but also has scrapped domestic environmental regulations. Scott Pruit, Trump's head of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced in March 2018 that Obama-era vehicle emissions standards would be rolled back. And at the very start of his term, Trump also said he would review the Clean Water Act and Clean Power Plan. The ACA, nicknamed \"Obamacare,\" was landmark legislation that roughly halved the number of medically uninsured Americans through program expansion and insurance mandates. Its critics, Trump among them, described it as federal government overreach that would cause skyrocketing health costs for individuals. While total repeal has failed, Republicans did do away with the mandate in 2017 tax reform.

{"id": null, "body": "     Huge bushfires have been burning in Australia for months. But the risk of severe wildfires is increasing everywhere. A look at the link between climate change and this devastating trend. After months of extreme heat and drought in Australia,\u00a0 the fires finally came . Australia experiences bushfires every year. But this year they are particularly extreme \u2014 and summer in the southern hemisphere has only just begun. Eight million\u00a0hectares have been destroyed by the flames so far. Twenty-five\u00a0people and millions of animals have been killed. Entire regions have been left without power and clouds of smoke now cover half the continent, according to the preliminary assessment of the devastating fires. Dozens of fires tear through the Australian landscape. Millions of animals and 25 people have been killed so far But Australia isn't the only place which is burning. In 2019, online platform Global Forest Watch Fires \u00a0(GFW Fires) counted over 4.5 million fires worldwide that were larger than one square kilometer. That's a total of 400,000 more fires than 2018. \"The number of fires and their size varies from year to year, but the big trend is that the risk of fire is increasing globally,\" Susanne Winter, the Forest Program Manager at WWF Germany, told DW. The reasons fires start and take hold in the first place are complex. But experts are now pointing to a connection between the increasing risk of wildfires\u00a0and warmer ocean temperatures as a result of climate change. Read more:\u00a0 My Australian paradise lost\u00a0 Warmer seas act as fire accelerators Manmade greenhouse gases have raised Earth's average temperature by an estimated one degree Celsius since the 19th century. The sea surface has also warmed by 0.8 degrees Celsius . The warmer the ocean gets, the less energy and CO2 the water is able to absorb and store from the atmosphere. \"[The ocean] is like air conditioning for the planet,\" explains Karen Wiltshire, the vice director of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Marine and Polar Research. Strong winds drive the fire deeper and deeper into the bush. Extinguishing the fires at this point is almost impossible The consequences of this could be devastating. If the sea continues to warm, it will have an enormous impact on the climate from extreme temperatures, storms and droughts to floods and late rainy seasons which disrupt ecosystems. When strong winds tear through hot and dry landscapes such as Australia, the bushfire risk increases significantly. But the risk is also growing in regions which were once temperate and cool. Read more:\u00a0 Oceans play role in Australian bushfires drama, say experts Even the Arctic is burning In addition to the large fires burning in Europe and California , 2019 also saw wildfires in the Arctic. \"The kind of fires we have never seen before,\" says Clare Nullis from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Fire meets ice. The clearly-visible burn scar from one of the many wildfires in Siberia last year Plumes of smoke from Siberian fires in July 2019 were observed drifting hundreds of kilometers to the west from the east Alaska experienced\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0record-breaking temperatures \u00a0of up to 32 degrees Celcius, creating conditions for the fires. According to the WMO, we can expect to see forests in the northern hemisphere burn like they never have over the past 10,000 years. In Alberta in northern Canada, hundreds of fires burned for months over 800,000 hectares of land in summer 2019. According to estimates by Russian authorities, around 9 million hectares of forest were burned in Siberia \u2014 a bigger area than the entire country of Portugal. The toxic smoke settled over villages and towns. Humans to blame for burning forests Fires are actually a natural process in the regeneration and renewal of ecosystems. However, 96% of the world's fires are now either deliberately lit or unintentionally caused by humans. Only 4% of fires \u00a0start naturally;\u00a0for example due to lightning strikes, according to a report by WWF. Many areas are cleared using the slash and burn method to make way for agriculture, livestock or industry, particularly in the Amazon region. In Indonesia as well, over 27 million hectares of forest have been destroyed since 1990 for paper and palm oil industries. Africa Data from the Global Forest Watch Fires shows that many fires are blazing across Africa , from South Sudan to West Africa. Experts say high population density has led to increasingly intensive use of natural resources, meaning the ecosystems have less and less time to recover. And the fires are also becoming more common. \"The main reason for this is the widespread use of shifting cultivation,\" explains Winter. \"Landowners and farmers [use fire to clear] their fields to quickly get rid of vegetation and make the soil fertile in the short term.\" Some of these fires can get out of control, leading to larger wildfires. The Amazon There were more fires across South America last year than there have\u00a0been since 2010. Large areas of forest were cleared for agriculture in the Amazon region in 2019. \"These were not natural causes,\" says Nullis. \"The forest fires in Brazil are politically motivated,\" adds Winter. \"Of course, we cannot compare them to the fires in Africa.\" Between January and November 2019, more than 80% of forest was destroyed compared to the previous year. Thirty\u00a0years ago, the Amazon was still so humid that fires like the ones we see today would not have been possible, says Winter. However, the Amazon is getting drier and drier thanks to more and more clearing of land. More wildfires create a feedback loop: The CO2 released fuels climate change, which in turn increases the risk of more fires The 2019 fires in the Amazon were devastating. All over South America, more fires have burned in total compared to 2010 Read more:\u00a0 Amazon wildfires set to cause irreversible damage Climate change and the cycle of fire Deforestation, climate change and the risk of wildfires are all directly linked. \"We are dealing with a feedback effect here,\" says Winter. \"More deforestation means an increase in climate change, which increases the chances of the vegetation drying out, which in turn increases the risk of fire and so on.\" And the fires continue to increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. According to Greenpeace, around 8 billion tons of CO2 are released by fire every year. This is about half as much as the emissions caused by the burning of coal around the world. The bushfires in Australia have already released half the amount of CO2 that the continent would otherwise produce during typical year. And the smoke trails are now spreading across the Pacific to Argentina and Chile. Editor's note: The original version of this article stated that there were two and a half times more fires in 2019 than in 2001. We later removed this figure after discovering an error. The lower number from 2001 reflected the fact that satellite data at the time\u00a0was collected by NASA's Terra satellite. Starting in mid-2002, this data was expanded to include detections from the Aqua satellite, which\u00a0caused the number of detections to rise significantly.\u00a0 Massive bushfires\u00a0have devastated Australia as the blazes continue to rage across the country. Since the start of one of the worst fire seasons on record, more than 2,500\u00a0homes have been burned, tens of thousands of people evacuated, and at least 29 killed. Here, a photographer reacts to seeing the burnt-out remains of a relative's home in Quaama, New South Wales. As of January 17, fires have burnt roughly 10 million hectares (25 million acres) of land, an area larger than South Korea or Portugal. More than 170 fires continue to burn in Victoria state and New South Wales. There were 82 fires burning across New South Wales, 30 uncontained, and several fires in Victoria, according to fire authorities. Firefighters protect homes around Charmhaven, New South Wales, on December 30. Wildfires burning across four Australian states that day destroyed hundreds of properties and caused multiple fatalities. A volunteer firefighter was killed and three others were injured after strong winds pushed a fire truck over. A person stands in protective gear as nearby bushfires turn the sky red in Mallacoota, Victoria. Thousands of people in the coastal region were told to evacuate over the New Year period, while the Country Fire Authority later issued an ominous warning to residents still in the area that it was \"too late to leave.\" Some 4,000 people spent New Year's Eve on the beach to avoid the flames. An air tanker drops fire retardant over the Gospers Mountain fire near Colo Heights, northwest of Sydney, Australia on November 15, 2019. The Gospers Mountain fire originated in the Wollemi National Park, and came close to merging with other major fires in the area. Fires have torn apart the Blue Mountains, a popular tourist area, burning more than 500,000 hectares of land. A burnt bicycle lies on the ground in front of a house destroyed by bushfires on the outskirts of the town of Bargo, near Sydney, on December 21, 2019. The town was hit with a catastrophic fire danger warning as fires turned several nearby homes to ashes. The New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian declared a state of emergency that same week. Firefighters are among the 28 people who have lost their lives in the fires. Some were volunteers. Thirty-two-year-old Geoffrey Keaton, along with a colleague, died when a burnt tree fell in the path of their fire truck. Keaton's nineteen-month-old son Harvey was awarded one of the service's highest honors on behalf of his father on January 2. A kangaroo that survived the bushfire in Wollemi National Park in Sydney grazes for food in November 2019. The fires have not only sparked concern over human well-being, but have also created worries over the survival of endangered and vulnerable animals. The fires have killed more than a billion animals across eastern and southern Australia. The Insurance Council of Australia said on January 7 that the bushfires have caused at least US$485 million (\u20ac435 million) in damage and that number was likely to rise. Separately, authorities warned of looters in towns where people have evacuated and scammers taking advantage of fundraisers for relief efforts. The bushfires have devastated Australia's koala population. In New South Wales state alone, officials estimate 30% of koala habitat - eucalpyt woodlands, which they use for both food and shelter - may have been lost. At least 45 koalas were being treated for burns at the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital. Thousands of people took to the streets on January 10 in Australia's major cities to rally against Prime Minister Scott Morrison's inaction on climate change and his handling of the ongoing bushfire crises. The nationwide rallies were organized by university students in Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart. Smoke from Australia drifted across the Pacific and reached South America, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on January 7. On January 2, the EU Copernicus program recorded the highest concentrations of atmospheric carbon monoxide in the world over the \"clean\" South Pacific Ocean stemming from the fires in Australia. Fires are nothing new for Australia. But the blazes engulfing the country have now reached new dimensions and the country's leaders continue to dismiss climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     Europe's waters are expected to lose 30% of their already vulnerable ocean life to further warming, says a new study. Combined with overfishing, that loss can threaten livelihood and food security in coastal nations. The Earth's oceans will lose 5%\u00a0of marine animals globally for every degree of warming, even without taking into account the broader impacts of fishing, according to the most comprehensive\u00a0global study of its kind \u00a0published in the\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on June 11.\u00a0 With warmer oceans pushing fish toward\u00a0the cooler poles and larger species suffering the biggest decline, the new report, \"Global ensemble projections reveal trophic amplification of ocean biomass declines with climate change,\" aims to provide the\u00a0clearest picture yet of how climate breakdown risks the structure and function of our oceans' ecosystems. While warmer global temperatures have already caused a significant loss and redistribution of the world's sea life, the impacts in Europe will be the most keenly felt, according to one of the report's 35 authors, Boris Worm from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. DW spoke with\u00a0Worm\u00a0about the impact of climate change in the oceans\u00a0and how\u00a0we can reverse the\u00a0trend. Fishermen across the world are struggling to cope with the impacts of climate change DW: It doesn't come as a surprise that climate change is affecting the\u00a0oceans. But what's the situation in Europe's seas? Boris Worm: In Europe we typically don't feel as vulnerable to climate change as,\u00a0say, people in Bangladesh\u00a0or in sub-Saharan Africa. But this report shows that Europe is actually among the most vulnerable in terms of climate impacts on marine ecosystems and declines in marine animal biomass. In various regions of Europe, there has already been a 15-20% reduction in productive capacity and we expect an additional\u00a030% reduction with further warming. The global average masks the fact that\u00a0 the declines we're already seeing, \u00a0and expect to see in the future, will be much more damaging here than in other ocean basins. From that perspective, Europe is not shielded in any way from the impacts of climate change on our oceans; we're actually at the forefront of climate change. We can't buy our way out of this. Read more:  'Fishing the last fish': Is the EU doing enough to protect fisheries? However, since climate change affects the distribution of fish stocks and species begin to migrate from warmer to cooler areas, could the North Sea benefit from such a migration? The North Sea is one of the regions that is already seeing, and will further see, declines in productive capacity with climate change. But northern waters, for example in northern Norway, are seeing an increase in total biomass. The available habitat for fish that can live in these very northern waters is expanding right up to the North Pole. So now we have cod spawning just a few degrees shy of the North Pole, where they were never found in the past because the habitat conditions were not suitable for them. The question is how much are you able to gain from the ocean, and both the historic analysis of the last 70 years and the future forecast show that the total volume of what can live in our waters is decreasing\u00a0and will further decrease. And with every step up the food chain, we see a larger effect of climate change. While the effects on plankton may be relatively more moderate, the effects on small fish are much larger, and even larger on larger fish. That's concerning, because a lot of the animals we really care about tend to be large. Think about large bluefin tuna, whales or seabirds. Japan is the world's largest consumer of bluefin tuna. Surging consumption in the country and overseas has led to overfishing of the species, with experts warning it faces possible extinction. \"The celebration surrounding the annual Pacific bluefin auction hides how deeply in trouble this species really is,\" said Jamie Gibbon, associate manager for global tuna conservation at The Pew Charitable Trusts. Tsukiji, once the world's largest fish market, closed in October 2018 after 83 years and relocated to the new Toyosu market (pictured).Here, wholesalers at the Tokyo market check the quality of the fish before auction. Kiyoshi Kimura, president of the Sushi Zanmai restaurant chain, conducted a dissecting show after he bought the massive bluefin tuna on Saturday. Workers moved the 278-kilogram (610-pound) bluefish tuna by handcart after it fetched a record 333.6 million yen ($3.1 million/\u20ac2.7 million) at the New Year's market. Sushi made from the expensive bluefin tuna was served at a restaurant run by the buyer, Kiyoshi Kimura. Climate change is largely to blame, but how does overfishing play into all of this? The effect\u00a0of fishing on marine animals' biomass is quite a bit larger than that of climate change, but climate change is going to impact marine animal biomass' whether we're fishing or not.\u00a0 If\u00a0both fishing\u00a0and climate change remain\u00a0unchecked, we could see an ocean that's much more depleted than we can imagine now. In fact, a\u00a0lot of the really drastic stock collapses we've seen in the past have often been due to the fact that a stock\u00a0was not doing well due to an unfavorable environment and was fished very hard at the same time. So if those two pressures come together, \u00a0we can see fairly drastic and rapid changes that may not be easy to reverse. And what are the social impacts of such a situation? How would this affect an average person? The redistribution of fish due to climate change has already sparked conflict,\u00a0for example with mackerel from the North Sea moving into Icelandic waters. They\u00a0weren't\u00a0there before, so they didn't have a quota. As\u00a0Iceland started\u00a0to fish a certain quota\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which has to be accounted for because it's a zero sum game\u00a0\u2014 other nations could\u00a0fish that stock less. So, with climate change, the questions about whose fish they are\u00a0and how much is there for the future are becoming more pressing. What happens if fishing villages in countries like Norway run out of fish? We do have a lot of precedence for what it looks like when oceans become quite empty. For example, in the Philippines, due to unchecked exploitation of coastal waters, people have to pick up sea urchins or any other invertebrates they might find.\u00a0 There are no fish left \u00a0and something needs to be there for the dinner plate. I've seen it as well off West Africa where foreign overfishing has threatened the livelihoods and food security of coastal nations. The social consequences can be quite dire.\u00a0Fish are actually very important for delivering micronutrients that are important for brain development, particularly in children, and there are\u00a0a lot of countries with no other readily available source.\u00a0 So what needs to be done to avoid the current situation\u00a0from worsening? We can\u00a0 fish more cautiously \u00a0and let populations rebuild the\u00a0biomass where they're more resilient, and we can address climate change from the bottom and not let the oceans warm to the degree that they would under business as usual.\u00a0 Marine biologist Boris Worm hopes that by working together, humans will be able to survive It adds emphasis to European leadership in climate negotiation and climate mitigation, and trying to get ahead of this problem and lead the trend toward\u00a0faster climate action. It's something we need to do anyways as we're running out of fossil fuels, so if we do it earlier we can avoid some of these deleterious impacts. But, you know, I'm always hopeful. Humans are good at collaborating. We're a social species, much like killer whales and wolves, and we can work together. That's how we survived in the past and I think that's how we will survive in the future.\u00a0 Boris Worm is a marine ecologist and Killam Research Professor at Dalhousie University in\u00a0Halifax, Canada.\u00a0 This interview\u00a0has been edited and condensed for clarity.

A ceremony at the site highlighted the urgency of climate protection. Iceland has been commemorating\u00a0the country's first glacier lost to climate change, with a memorial plaque warning of the effects of global warming being installed at the site. Icelandic officials, activists and others took part\u00a0in a ceremony on Sunday that included poetry, silence and political speeches on the urgency of taking action to curb rising global temperatures. The disappearance of Okjokull, a glacier in the west of the sub-Arctic island,\u00a0is being seen\u00a0as directly due to the warming of the climate caused by human activity. The plaque bears the words: \"This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.\" \u00a0\"We see the consequences of the climate crisis,\" Icelandic Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir said. \"We have no time to lose.\" She said she would make talks on the climate crisis a priority at a meeting between Nordic leaders and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday.  These two photos taken in 1986 and 2019 show the loss of ice at the glacier First monument to climate change The commemoration project was initiated by local researchers and their colleagues\u00a0from Rice University in the US. Guests also included Iceland's\u00a0environment minister\u00a0Gudmundur Ingi Gudbrandsson and\u00a0former United Nations high commissioner for human rights\u00a0Mary Robinson. \"This will be the first monument to a glacier lost to climate change anywhere in the world,\" Cymene Howe, associate professor of anthropology at Rice University, said in July. Scientists warn that about 400 glaciers in Iceland risk the same fate, fearing that they will all be gone by 2200. The country is losing approximately 11 billion tons of ice per year. Howe said that memorializing a lost glacier emphasizes what is being lost and\u00a0 disappearing all over the world. She said that\u00a0a ceremony also draws attention \"to the fact that this is something that humans have 'accomplished,'\u00a0although it is not something we should be proud of.\" Read more : Himalayan ice melting at 'scary' levels A ceremony to provoke real emotions The researchers said that as conversations about climate change can be abstract\u00a0with \"many dire statistics and sophisticated scientific models that can feel incomprehensible,\"\u00a0a monument to a fallen glacier is a better way for people to comprehend what is happening to the planet. The researchers hoped the commemoration would\u00a0provoke feelings through the powerful use of symbols and ceremony. Okjokull, meaning \"Ok Glacier\" in Icelandic, became Iceland's first major ice flow\u00a0to be officially\u00a0stripped of its glacier status in 2014. It has now been called just \"Ok,\" removing the glacier from its name. Growing problem In 1890, Okjokull covered 16 square kilometers (6.2 square miles), but by 2012, it measured just 0.7 square kilometers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that nearly half of the world's heritage sites could\u00a0 lose their glaciers by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate. Iceland has become heavily reliant on tourism, which is the country's biggest industry. The island welcomed 2.3 million international tourists last year, with many visiting to admire its glaciers.

Musk raised concerns about the climate impact of Bitcoin mining. The e-car company reversed its plan to accept the cryptocurrency as a payment option The US electric car manufacturer Tesla suspended\u00a0its plans to accept Bitcoin as a payment method, CEO Elon Musk announced in a Twitter statement late\u00a0Wednesday. Musk, who has become notorious for moving the price of cryptocurrencies via tweets,\u00a0cited the massive amount of energy required to keep Bitcoin running and its environmental impacts as the reasoning behind Tesla's turnaround. \"We are concerned about rapid increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,\" the statement said. While cryptocurrency is a \"good idea on many levels,\" it comes at a \"great cost to the environment,\" Musk said. The price of Bitcoin dropped\u00a0nearly 13%\u00a0late Wednesday after Tesla's announcement, according to Coin Metrics.\u00a0The cryptocurrency website coindesk\u00a0showed Bitcoin's dollar value dipped\u00a0to a\u00a024-hour low of\u00a0just above $46,000, before rebounding slightly to hover around $50,000. Tesla sparked a Bitcoin boom\u00a0in February,\u00a0after announcing it would\u00a0invest some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency\u00a0with the intention to allow customers to buy their e-cars with it . The fair market value of Tesla's Bitcoin by the end of March was $2.48 billion, securities filings showed. Tesla said it was not planning to sell its Bitcoin holdings. \"Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy,\" the statement said. The company was also looking into other cryptocurrency options without Bitcoin's environmental impacts, it said. Bitcoin is mined by computers solving complex puzzles. As more Bitcoin is mined, the more complex the puzzles become thus requiring more computational energy. A 2019 study from researchers at the Technical University of Munich and MIT found that the CO2 emissions for the entire Bitcoin network amounted to up to 22.9 million tons in 2018. At such a rate, the carbon emissions connected to Bitcoin resemble those of a large city in a rich country or an entire developing country such as Sri Lanka.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate scientists have used models to confirm that burning fossil fuels made the extreme heat wave in parts of the US and Canada hotter and more likely. The Canadian town of Lytton was all but destroyed in a wildfire in late June When a heat wave began to scorch Canada and the US in late June \u2014 killing elderly people alone in their homes and fueling wildfires that wiped out an entire village \u2014 scientists said burning fossil fuels had changed the climate enough to make the temperature extremes worse. One week later, they know by how much. Global warming made the hottest day of the North American heat wave 150 times more likely and 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) hotter, according to a rapid attribution study released Thursday by an international team of 27 scientists from the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA). Temperatures broke records in Oregon and Washington, in the US, and in British Columbia, in Canada. They reached a high of 49.6 C (121 F) that researchers say would have been \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. The study, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, is the latest example of scientists using models to swiftly assess the role of greenhouse gas emissions in exacerbating extreme weather. Its findings dispel a myth prevalent in rich countries that climate change only hurts people far away from them or in the distant future. \"We are entering uncharted territory,\" said study co-author Sonia Seneviratne, from the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. \"Much higher temperature records will be reached if we don't manage to stop greenhouse gas emissions and halt global warming.\" The temperatures \u2014 which authorities estimate have killed hundreds of people \u2014 were so much higher than historical records that researchers struggled to work out exactly how often such a heat wave could be expected. Their best guess is that such temperatures would occur once every thousand years in today's climate . And they found two theories for how it got so hot. One explanation is that a combination of preexisting drought and unusual atmospheric conditions \u2014 a heat dome of warm air trapped in place by a bend in the jet stream \u2014 combined with climate change to drastically raise temperatures. \"The statistical equivalent of really bad luck, albeit aggravated by climate change,\" the authors summarized. An alternative, more troubling possibility is that the climate system may have already crossed a threshold where small amounts of warming push up temperatures up faster than previously observed. If true, it would mean such record-breaking heat waves have already become more likely to happen than climate models predict. Heat waves are particularly dangerous for elderly people \"What we are seeing is unprecedented,\" said study co-author Friederike Otto, from the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. \"This is such an exceptional event that we can't rule out the possibility that we're experiencing heat extremes today that we only expected to come at higher levels of global warming.\" Previous heat records were \"pulverized\" by such large margins that \"something else must be going on,\" said Stefan Rahmstorf, head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was not involved in the study. \"The study is valid and state of the art.\" Climate change has made heat waves hotter, longer and more common. By burning fossil fuels \u2014 which release gases that trap the sun's heat like a greenhouse \u2014 humans have warmed the planet by about 1.1 C above preindustrial levels. This raises the chance of record-breaking temperatures. Lytton, a village in the Canadian province of British Columbia, broke the country's heat record on July 2 when temperatures shot almost 5 C above the previous record of 45 C. The next day it was destroyed by a wildfire. \"We are a small, rural, Indigenous, low-income community and we are at the spearpoint of climate change,\" Gordon Murray, a resident who escaped Lytton, said in an interview Friday with public broadcaster CBC News. \"But it's coming for everybody. We're the canary in the coal mine.\" Wildfires in British Columbia, Canada, destroyed an entire village Heat waves, which have been among the deadliest disasters in the past few years, stress the human body. Hot weather exacerbates existing health conditions like heart, lung and kidney disease, as well as diabetes. It is particularly harmful to elderly people, young children, construction workers and homeless people. The Pacific Northwest\u00a0is used to a cool, often rainy climate, and fewer people have air conditioning than in southern states. In Oregon, authorities estimate that 107 people mostly aged 60 or older died from heat-related causes during the temperature spike. Because temperatures in Oregon stayed high overnight, people couldn't cool down and recover, said Brandon Maughan, an emergency medicine doctor at Oregon Health and Science University in the state's largest city, Portland, which experienced searing heat over three days at the end of June that peaked at 46.7 C. \"Many people assumed that they would suffer through it like they have in prior summers. And this is just fundamentally different.\" Schools and COVID-19 test centers have closed while large spaces have been turned into cooling stations In an average year, he said, Oregon hospitals treat many people for heat exhaustion \u2014 which they can manage at home while feeling unwell \u2014 but few people come in with symptoms of the more serious heat stroke. \"We just saw more of it this year.\" \u00a0A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change in May that found 1 in 3 deaths from heat during warm seasons since 1991 can be attributed to climate change. The North America heat wave shows that \"current adaptation systems are not prepared for such very extreme events,\" said Ana Vicedo, group leader for climate change and health at the University of Bern in Switzerland, and co-author of the study. In 2003, in Europe, a summer heat wave made twice as likely by global warming killed more than 70,000 people. In Paris alone, climate change increased the risk of dying from heat by 70%, leading to more than 500 deaths. Doctors recommend checking on vulnerable neighbors and staying in the shade People can stay cool by finding public places with shade or air conditioning, drinking water, and keeping an eye on elderly and vulnerable neighbors. This can be trickier in cities, where concrete buildings and asphalt roads absorb heat and raise temperatures even higher than in the surrounding countryside. Local governments can reduce the burden by designing cities with more trees, parks and waterways. Though people can adapt to hotter temperatures, scientists stress that climate policy to stop emissions is what will decide the length, strength and frequency of heat waves. In 2015, world leaders promised to limit global warming to well below 2 C above preindustrial levels. Their current policies will instead heat the planet by about 3 C, according to German-based research group Climate Action Tracker. The WWA study found that global warming of 2 C would make heat waves like the one in North America so likely they would hit every five to 10 years. The Canadian town of Lytton saw record-breaking heat on July 2 when temperatures hit nearly 50 degrees Celcius. A few days later, the village was all but destroyed in a wildfire. Experts warn that heat domes like those in North America are becoming more likely due to global warming, which has slowed down the jet stream. This is why such extreme conditions tend to sometimes last for weeks. It\u2019s been the hottest July since 1914 in Lapland with 33.6 C recorded in northern Finland. Parts of Scandinavia have also been experiencing temperatures that are 10-15 degrees above average. Meteorologists say that the record heat in northern Europe is linked to the heat dome above North America. India has also been unusually hot this year. At the beginning of July, the capital New Delhi saw temperatures hit 43C, the hottest ever in nine years. The start of the monsoon season has also been delayed by about a week this year. India has seen at least 6,500 heat-related deaths since 2010. Siberia has also seen sweltering heat this year, with temperatures of over 30C in May, making this region north of the Arctic Circle warmer than many parts of Europe. Drought and high temperatures are also leading to large-scale fires in densely forested Northern Russia. And its permafrost is melting, releasing more and more Co2 and methane into the atmosphere. Winter in the Southern Hemisphere is also unusually warm this year. Hastings, New Zealand saw temperatures rise to 22C last month. It was the warmest June in 110 years, according to the National Meteorological Agency (NIWA). Average temperatures increased by about 2C. Warmer winters pose a problem for agriculture and, of course, ski resorts. At a sizzling 51.4C, Mexico recorded its hottest-ever temperature in June. Mexico is going through its worst drought in 30 years. Baja California is particularly affected and the Colorado River there has partially dried up. Water levels in the reservoirs near Mexico City are also falling. The Arabian Peninsula and North Africa have also been particularly hot this year. The Sahara Desert saw the mercury rise to 50C last month. Meanwhile, in western Libya, it was 10 degrees warmer than usual at the end of June, according to the National Center for Meterology. In the oasis city of Ghadames, the heat rose to 46C, with the capital Tripoli not far behind at 43C.

{"id": null, "body": "     Does worrying about climate change keep you up at night? Growing numbers of people are struggling with eco-anxiety, or distress about the state of the planet. If you're one of them, these expert tips might help. Research has shown that young people in many countries are suffering from climate anxiety Shrinking ice caps, disappearing biodiversity, fiercer bushfires, heat waves \u00a0and flash floods. The effects of climate change are difficult to ignore. These disasters not only cause immense physical destruction . A growing body of evidence shows they're also taking a toll on our mental health . Researchers say eco-anxiety is rising, especially among members of younger generations who report feeling distressed and overwhelmed by the state of the environment . In a major study of young people aged 16 to 25 published in The Lancet last year, 75% said the \"future is frightening\" and more than half said \"humanity is doomed.\" Of the 10,000 respondents across\u00a010 countries, 45%\u00a0said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their ability to function in daily life. Eco-anxiety, or climate anxiety, covers a range of responses to climate change, from fear about the future, to shame and guilt over consumption, to anger and grief over what has and will be lost . So if you find yourself grappling with these feelings, what should you do? In the Lancet study, more than 50% of young people reported feeling sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless and guilty about climate change. Liz Marks, co-lead author of the study and a senior lecturer in psychology at the UK's University of Bath, said a first step in dealing with these emotions is to acknowledge that they are a natural and healthy response to an existential threat. \"When talking about eco-anxiety, it's important not to pathologize it,\" she said. \"It isn't something we need to cure or get rid of. It's much more about how we can live with it so it doesn't overwhelm us.\" Fires and heat waves are expected to get more intense as a result of climate change According to Marks, that means \"giving ourselves and other people space to feel what we're feeling, whether that be grief or anger or fear or anxiety, and also recognizing that these feelings will come and go. Even in the worst moments of feeling very overwhelmed, emotions are things that change.\" She also says although they are stressful, these feelings can be \"a really beautiful part of your humanity,\" and a positive sign that someone is engaged and cares deeply about the planet, other species and people around the world. If you're feeling overwhelmed by the climate crisis, it can help to seek out communities in real life or on social media and share your thoughts with like-minded people, said climate coaching psychologist Megan Kennedy-Woodard. \"It is really wonderful because there are these communities where people can see: 'actually so much is happening here. I don't feel like this is all on my shoulders,' or 'this person is talking about grief and I was feeling it today, and it's normal and it's OK that I'm feeling that',\" said Kennedy-Woodard, who is also co-director of the group Climate Psychologists. An array of groups offering support to people struggling with eco-anxiety have popped up around the world in recent years. There are climate cafes, for example, or NGOs such as the Good Grief Network, which has a 10-step program that, according to its website, aims to \"metabolize collective grief, eco-anxiety, and other heavy emotions\" to help people build resilience. Eco-anxiety can also mean struggling with guilt over humanity's impact on the planet There's no shortage of gloomy news stories about species loss and natural disasters. If you're someone engaged with environmental issues, your social media feeds might be full of them. Liz Marks says it's important to prioritize your well-being and take a break from media that causes distress. \"This isn't about pushing it away completely,\" she said. \"You might want to remain informed, but perhaps it's about reducing the frequency and amount of time you spend reading about the climate crisis and trying to choose reliable information sources that aren't going to cause a huge spike in anxiety.\" She stressed\u00a0that while mindfulness is no cure for climate change, it can help relieve stress, along with regular exercise and activities that allow you to feel calm and connected to others. Clinical psychologist Patrick Kennedy-Williams, the other co-director of Climate Psychologists, agreed that self-care is vital.\u00a0\"We're all in this for the long run and we have to be able to get satisfaction and enjoyment from our lives despite this crisis ... It's OK to enjoy yourself.\" If the anxiety gets to a point where it affects your life, work and relationships on a daily basis, however, it's advisable to seek professional help, he added. Patrick Kennedy-Williams and Megan Kennedy-Woodard work with people who are struggling with climate anxiety Studies show eco-anxiety is more prevalent in young\u00a0people, many of whom feel older generations and governments are failing to respond to the climate crisis. Marks said taking actions, however small, to combat environmental destruction, for example, can help overcome a sense of powerlessness many young people face. \"Their eco-anxiety is less overwhelming when they feel they're doing something about it,\" she said. \"How can you make a difference in a way that works for you? Some people have very little time, very little resources, but can still make a difference. That could be anything from engaging in green behaviors like recycling ... to writing [to] MPs.\" Parents of children with eco-anxiety could perhaps plan a family activity, such as a local cleanup day, said Kennedy-Williams. \"It's the uncertainty that drives a lot of fear and anxiety in kids,\" he said. \"So if they if they feel like they can\u00a0play their part \u2026 it's incredibly relieving of anxiety.\" It can also help to emphasize positive, solution-based climate news rather than only negative developments. \"Look at how we all took action to begin closing the hole in the ozone layer, banning CFCs and so on. There are wonderful examples,\"\u00a0he added. All three psychologists stress that while it is important to be hopeful and build optimism, it's\u00a0not up to individuals to solve the crisis \u2014 a burden that can stoke guilt and anxiety in itself. \"This isn't the problem of the individual. We are all part of a system. It's the wider systems that have created this,\" said Kennedy-Woodard.

{"id": null, "body": "     Vladimir Putin has talked about global warming's toll as Siberia's Irkutsk region struggles to recover from floods. But there's a simple reason why Russia won't get behind climate protection policies, says Andrey Gurkov. With the devastating flood that has ravished the Irkutsk region in Siberia, Russia is experiencing one of its worst natural catastrophes in decades. More than 20 deaths have already been reported, and more than 33,000 people have been affected. For most, that means much more than flooded basements or ground floors filled with mud; rather, it's the loss of their very livelihood.\u00a0Their wooden houses were swept away by floodwaters, their animals perished\u00a0and their fields were destroyed. Extreme weather will increase Researchers at Irkutsk State University say the flood was caused by \"anomalous atmospheric processes taking place amid\u00a0global and regional climate change.\" They warn that global warming will lead to increasingly frequent periods of drought and heavy rainfall in Siberia. DW's Andrey Gurkov President Vladimir Putin, who visited the region , also points to climate change. At the recent G20 summit in Osaka , Japan, he told leaders that Russian meteorologists have determined that the country is warming at a rate 2 1/2 times faster than the global average. Will the catastrophe in the Irkutsk region lead to a change in Russia's skeptical stance on climate change? Has the flooding convinced the people of Siberia and Russia that increasingly extreme weather is a consequence of global warming? Will they demand their government take action to protect the environment, as so many young people across Europe have done this year?\u00a0\u00a0 The answer: No \u2014\u00a0most definitely not! Seeing the details, missing the bigger picture For an observer who has followed the German climate debate, it's perplexing to take stock of how news reports and social media discussions\u00a0in Russia are dealing with the flood. No one wants to listen to what experts have to say about the links between global warming and the catastrophe in Siberia. People brush off such talk as \"stupid,\" as a \"hoax.\" At most, they are convinced that any talk of connections is simply a lame attempt by local and national government agencies to divert attention away from their own failings and responsibilities. The discussion generally focuses (with a certain amount of merit) on supposed government failures to prevent and fight the effects of natural catastrophes. For instance, there is much talk of shoddy dam construction. Conspiracy theories are also making the rounds, such as the\u00a0claim that water levels at dams were intentionally kept high to allow hydroelectric power plants to provide cheaper energy to an oligarch\u00a0with factories in the region. Even the massive deforestation that has taken place in the region is not really considered\u00a0a negative environmental development. Rather, it's seen as evidence the country is being \"sold off\" to China. Internet commenters and the Russian media tend to concentrate on exceedingly narrow details, instead of looking at the big picture.\u00a0It seems clear that people here think\u00a0in local,\u00a0rather than global terms.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0 Saving Russia's precious forests Internationally, Putin has presented himself as a contrast to the climate-skeptical Trump Vladimir Putin: Climate change fighter? That attitude would make it difficult for Putin to convince the country of the need to pursue active climate policies,\u00a0even if he wanted to. Moreover, with faith in the president on the wane, advocating such a shift would leave him open to criticism for using climate change as an excuse to divert attention from his own shortcomings. But Putin has absolutely no desire to initiate an active environmental policy. Although he speaks of the topic at international gatherings, like in Osaka, he does so to score points with his foreign colleagues and set himself apart from climate change denier Donald Trump. At home, Putin and Kremlin-controlled media outlets rarely, if at all, speak about the subject \u2014 and there is a very simple reason for that. Climate protection costs Russian businesses\u00a0 At its core, the fight against climate change means reducing CO2 emissions, and these come mainly from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil\u00a0and gas. But the extraction and export of those fuels are the basis of the Russian economy and the most important source of income for both the \"Putin system\" and those who profit from it,\u00a0as well as\u00a0the state, which uses the revenues to dole out payments to a broad swath of Russian society. Ultimately, a fundamental shift in climate policy would lead to the dismantling \u2014\u00a0or to put it in friendlier terms, a reorientation \u2014\u00a0of the current Russian business model. In recent years, Putin has shied away from far less ambitious reforms.\u00a0 And it's clear that the Russian people have no desire to make sacrifices for something as abstract as the concept of the global climate. They seem much more willing to suffer ever greater catastrophes resulting from climate change, all the while vehemently denying that such a thing even exists.\u00a0 Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change is hitting Spain harder than most other European nations. Drinking water is scarce and beaches are receding. There's a danger that tourism in the country will suffer a major setback in the decades to come. British economist Nicholas Stern said earlier this year there could be no doubt that if temperatures rose beyond the limits laid down\u00a0in the Paris Agreement, Spain would risk turning\u00a0into a Sahara-like desert. As climate activist Greta Thunberg mobilizes Spain's youth, many are wondering if policymakers in the country have really got the memo regarding the\u00a0importance of\u00a0environmental protection and renewable energies to\u00a0the southern European nation. At the recent Med7 meeting of Mediterranean countries, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said his nation had to take the lead in climate protection in Europe, indicating that the rise of temperatures and strong winds were\u00a0already having an impact on Spain's most stable source of income \u2014 tourism . Spain a green world power? Tourism still secures the most jobs in Spain, a country traditionally suffering from high structural unemployment. For the government it's clear that the tourism sector has to be supported in any possible way. This is why Sanchez attended the \"Change the Change\" climate protection conference in San Sebastian earlier this year to support the call for speeding up climate-protecting measures. \"We have to be serious about meeting our climate targets,\" said Sanchez, who aspires to spearhead Europe's campaign. He intends to put forward\u00a0Teresa Ribera, his environment and energy minister, for the post of vice president of the European Commission. Luis Mereno from the Energias Renovables journal has recently praised her for scrapping a tax on self-installed solar panels, saying she had prepared the ground for a new energy policy in the country. Producing solar power costs far less in Spain than it does in most other Europen nations Mereno believes Ribera is a very talented and competent minister in the Sanchez\u00a0cabinet. Taking the lead At the moment, Spain still has to import \u20ac40 billion ($45 billion) worth of gas and oil annually, mainly from Algeria and Saudi Arabia. It could save at least part of that money by boosting solar energy. Spain boasts 3,000 hours of sun per year and has many unused areas where solar farms could be built, says Jose Carlos Diez from the University of Alcala,\u00a0near Madrid. \"We produce 1 megawatt of solar electricity for \u20ac30 \u2014 in Germany and France you pay \u20ac40 for the same amount; in Britain even \u20ac60,\" said Diez. Energy costs are also crucial for the tourism sector, being one of the largest energy consumers and accounting for 15% of\u00a0gross domestic product (GDP). Passenger aviation and the cruising industry have increasingly become the target of criticism from environmental pressure groups. The latter have also criticized high water consumption in hotels and at golf courses. Water treatment has also been identified as a major problem. In tourist hotspots such as Majorca, the Canary Islands or Benidorm, water from the tap still has to be filtered. A lot of energy is consumed in the roughly 750 desalination plants, which pump the salt back into the ocean, thus changing the underwater landscape near the coasts. Desalination, which has been used in Spain since 1964, has paved the way for mass tourism in the first place. Today, Spain only trails Saudi Arabia, the US and the United Arab Emirates in desalinating the most water, according to Spain's AEDyR industry group. The desalinated water is used in agriculture and on\u00a0many golf courses, which are also in evidence in the dry southern parts of the country. The sea levels threat Not only is Spain a tourist magnet, it's also one of the world's largest exporters of agricultural products. Farmers have also drawn the ire\u00a0of environmentalists. The latter say farmers waste a lot of water, use pesticides and damage the soil through dubious cultivation schemes . At least that's the opinion of Madrid-based tech entrepreneur Rafael Alvarez. Cruising ships like these here in Palma, Majorca, have been identified as heavy polluters by environmentalists Rising sea levels are a huge problem for Spain, he says. He's convinced that in the years ahead many beaches and fields will be flooded. In the north of the country, there's mounting soil erosion along the 5,978 kilometers (3715 miles) of\u00a0coast\u00a0where 90% of all tourists spend their vacations. Inigo Losada, research director at the Environmental Hydraulics Institute of Cantabria, warns that holiday homeowners and hotel chains will feel the pinch. Diving gets less attractive for tourists, if coral reefs disappear, he argues, and the danger of coastal areas being flooded doesn't help tourism either . Major Spanish tour companies such as Melia, Barcelo, Iberostar and Riu are preparing for the worst. Melia has already inquired about how hotels in the affected regions can get adequate insurance packages. Losada says German holiday homeowners in Spain should do the same. \"I have no way of knowing whether we'll be able to stop climate change,\" he warns, indicating that in his opinion some people should already relocate to be on the safe side. \"But no one wants to talk about such things,\" says Tim Wirth, a real estate lawyer, who's also active on Majorca. \"Because they're afraid it\u00a0could make people panic.\" \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate change a threat to tourism in Spain", "article_name": "climate-change-a-threat-to-tourism-in-spain", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-a-threat-to-tourism-in-spain/a-49271516", "date_published": "2019-06-20 00:00:00", "article_length": 5475, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:20.326202"}

American delegates have reportedly been stonewalling climate talks despite withdrawing from the landmark Paris deal. Hundreds of people took to the streets in Thailand and the Philippines \u2014 two countries projected to be among the hardest hit by climate change \u2014 to demand their government end their reliance on fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy. Some 200 demonstrators assembled outside the UN's regional headquarters in the Thai capital of Bangkok, where delegates were scrambling to breathe life into the Paris Agreement on climate change. Dozens of laborers and fishermen from the Gulf of Thailand, whose livelihoods are threatened by rising sea levels , joined Saturday's protest holding examples of their produce and banners demanding climate action. \"I came here today to ask the government to put coastal erosion on the national agenda,\" fisherwoman Aree Kongklad told the Agence France-Presse news agency. The protests, organized by the 350 environmental advocacy group, kicked off Saturday morning in Australia, as a tall ship sailed through Sydney Harbor sporting a banner reading \"Rise for Climate; Action with 350.\" Protests kicked off in Sydney Harbor in spectacular style Blair Palese, the CEO of 350 Australia, warned that Australia had long suffered from the effects of climate change due to its heavy economic reliance on coal mining .\u00a0\"We are fighting bushfires in winter, suffering a crippling drought, and scientists fear back-to-back of bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef this summer,\" said Palese. Meanwhile, in the Filipino capital of Manila, over 800 people marched through the streets to demonstrate against the country's heavy reliance on coal. The country has suffered from devastating weather phenomena such as Typhoon Haiyan, which is estimated to have killed some 7,350 people in 2013. \"We are among the most vulnerable and we are among those still stuck in an energy system that is backwards,\" campaigner Chuck Baclavon told AFP. Some 200 people demonstrated outside the UN's regional headquarters to let delegates know their livelihoods are at risk US stonewalls Bangkok talks Back in Bangkok, UN delegates accused the United States, despite withdrawing from the Paris deal, of blocking new funding options for poorer nations fighting global warming. The 2015 Paris deal promised an annual fund of $100 billion (\u20ac86 billion) from 2020 to help poor nations deal with flooding , heatwaves and rising sea levels. However, the deal did not specify where richer donor nations should source their contributions. The US, along with Japan and Australia, wants to remove rules forcing developed nations to account for their climate action funding.\u00a0 That would ensure that these nations can continue to include commercial loans and pre-existing state funding as part of their contributions.

However, \"in leading the charge to block practically every discussion on finance for the Paris guidelines, the US administration is threatening the future of the agreement and multilateralism itself,\" said Jesse Bragg from the Corporate Accountability watchdog.

{"id": null, "body": "     A flood of climate refugees could be imminent unless the richer nations do more to help poorer ones combat global warming, argues an IMF report. The international community must do more to help low-income countries cope with the climate change, says the IMF in its \"World Economic Outlook\" report to be released next month. \"Advanced and emerging market economies have contributed the lion's share to actual and projected warming,\" argues the IMF.\u00a0\"Helping low-income countries cope with its consequences is both a moral duty and sound global economic policy.\" Low-income countries bear\u00a0the brunt\u00a0 With an unprecedented increase in global temperatures over the past 40 years, and significant further warming predicted unless greenhouse gas emissions are massively reduced, low-income countries are set to suffer the worst\u00a0of the extreme droughts,\u00a0floods and rising sea\u00a0levels that will result \u2013 even if their emissions are relatively low. \"The Earth's warming affects countries very unequally,\" say the authors of the report\u00a0in the IMF Blog. \"Even though low-income countries have contributed very little to greenhouse gas emissions, they would bear the brunt of the adverse consequences of rising temperatures, since they tend to be situated in some of the hottest parts of the Earth.\" Jakarta, Indonesia, is sinking due to rising sea levels caused by global warming Countries in Africa, Asia and Central and South America will feel the effects of rising temperatures more than most. The IMF notes that a 1 degree increase in temperature in a country with an average annual temperature of 25 degrees \u2013 such as Bangladesh or Haiti \u2013 will initially reduce per capita output by up to 1.5 percent, a level that will rise to 10 percent by the end of the century if there are not adequate global efforts\u00a0to curb emissions. Economies in hot countries will be effected on various levels, including lower agricultural yields, reduced worker productivity, slow investment, and damaged health. Close to 60 percent of the world's population currently resides in countries that are vulnerable to such climate change consequences \u2013 a number that's projected to rise to 75 percent by the end of the century.\u00a0 Climate change-induced conflict and migration If higher temperatures potentially cause more natural disasters, this will also fuel greater conflict and migration, argues the IMF. \"The cross-border spillovers from these impacts of climate change in vulnerable countries could be very sizable, and advanced economies will not be immune either.\" Nonetheless, the report also cites research that shows that migration is largely limited to those who can afford to travel; and that people in low-income developing countries are generally trapped amid weather disasters triggered by climate change. The Turkana people of Northern Kenya are nomadic pastoralists whose stock \u2013 and livelihood \u2013 is rapidly dying due to drought exacerbated by climate change. \"Given the constraints faced by low-income countries, the international community must play a key role in supporting these countries' efforts to cope with climate change\u2014a global threat to which they have contributed little,\" say the IMF.\u00a0\u00a0 The report notes that low-income countries would need to increase public spending by up to 30 percent of GDP if they are to achieve attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\u00a0designed to combat climate change. Most don't have the money. \"Low-income countries also often lack the institutional setting, administrative capacity, or political stability to implement appropriate macroeconomic policies or adaptation strategies,\" says the IMF. So while Germany last year committed\u00a0to helping poorer countries transform their national climate action plans into concrete strategies , the IMF says richer countries that contribute substantially to greenhouse gas concentration must contribute more to climate adaptation costs throughout the world. \"Going forward, only a global effort to contain carbon emissions to levels consistent with an acceptable increase in temperature can limit the long-term risks of climate change.\" In the event of a global temperature increase of two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the World Bank predicts that southern Africa would experience up to thirty percent less rainfall. The result: an increased risk of drought. During an extremely dry period in the mid-1990s, herdsmen in Ethiopia lost around half their animals. In East Africa, there could be more rain in future - not spread equally throughout the year but pouring down on just a few consecutive days. In 2011 torrential rainfall hit the Tanzanian port city of Dar Es Salaam, flooding entire districts. 10,000 people had to be housed in emergency accommodation. At least 23 people died. In Africa small farmers produce some 90 percent of the continent's harvests. If crop resistance to the increasing droughts, floods and other weather disasters does not improve greatly, up to 20 percent more people will suffer hunger by 2050, the UN estimates. Malnutrition resulting from poor harvests is already a problem in many countries. Many people move to city slums where diseases like cholera quickly spread. If temperatures rise, other diseases like malaria could also spread more quickly - for example in the East African highlands, a region that is currently malaria-free. Higher temperatures influence entire eco-systems. Many plants and animals cannot adapt to the changing conditions quickly enough. A report by the World Climate Council says that between 20 and 30 percent of all species face extinction as a result of climate change. The covering of ice on Mount Kilimanjaro is almost 12,000 years old. In the last 100 years more than 80 percent of the ice fields have disappeared. A research group in Ohio has calculated that if this continues, the ice will have vanished completely by 2033 at the latest. They say drought and reduced snowfall would be the main reasons. Much of the responsibility for climate change lies with power plants, factories and automobiles in the US, Europe and Asia. But the felling of many African forests, for example to obtain charcoal, increases the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and contributes to the destruction of the soil. Many people have now realised that they have to act to counter the effects of climate change. For decades, environmentally aware Kenyans have been planting new trees and the area covered by forest is expanding. The trees prevent valuable farmland from being eroded - and they absorb the greenhouse gas CO2. Monocultures are very susceptible to drought or attack by pests. If different types of fruit are grown together, then there is still a harvest if one of them fails. According to the UN Environment Program (UNEP) ecological agriculture increases resistance to the consequences of climate change more effectively than conventional farming. Underground rainwater reservoirs, insurance schemes that act as a buffer when harvests fail - there are many ways to soften the effects of climate change. Development aid and climate protection must go hand in hand, stressed delegates at a recent UN conference. However, no concrete projects were put forward. \"Climate justice now!\" demonstrators called at at a UN climate conference in Durban, South Africa, four years ago. They are now looking towards the end of this year when climate change will be discussed in Paris. There, the first global climate agreement could be adopted, with the goal of restricting the effects of climate change and keeping the global warming increase to two degrees Celsius. Author: Hilke Fischer / sh IMF chief Christine Lagarde has warned of dire consequences if we fail to take action on climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     The UN panel on climate change has warned that governments must act fast if the impact of global warming is to be limited at a manageable cost. Its report will form the basis for a global climate deal next year. Governments will have to reduce greenhouse emissions to zero by 2100 if the impact of climate change is to be kept in check at an affordable cost, a United Nations report said on Sunday. If rapid steps were not taken to cut the emissions, however, the price could rise considerably, it said, warning that a failure to curb global warming by the end of the 21st century \"will bring high risks of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally.\" Such an \"irreversible impact\" would occur, for example, if Greenland's vast ice sheets were to melt, which could result in the swamping of coastal regions and cities. The effects of climate change were already evident in an increase in extremes of heat, heavy rainfall, the acidification of the world's oceans and a rise in sea levels, the study said. According to the report released by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), the cost of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions in the short term would not brake global growth to any great degree. It said annual projected growth of 1.6 to 3.0 percent a year in consumption of goods and services would be cut by just 0.06 of a percentage point per year if immediate action were taken.  Final assessment The report is a 40-page synthesis summing up 5,000 pages of climate change studies already published since September 2013. The studies establish with 95-percent certainty that almost all global warming seen since the 1950s is man-made. The document, which has been edited for a week by officials from more than 120 governments meeting in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, is to furnish guidelines for a UN deal on global warming scheduled to be struck at an international summit in Paris in late 2015.  Words of hope Options for limiting the amount of greenhouse gas emissions included improving energy efficiency and moving from fossil fuels to wind, solar or nuclear power, according to the study. \"We have the means to limit climate change,\" IPCC chairman Rejendra Pachauri said. \"The solutions are many and allow for continued economic and human development. All we need is the will to change, which we trust will be motivated by knowledge and an understanding of the science of climate change,\" he added. UN climate negotiations are to continue next month in Lima, Peru, where international delegates are to work on a final draft agreement for the 200-nation Paris summit. tj/sb (AP, Reuters) China and Russia have blocked an agreement to protect key areas of the Antarctic Ocean.

{"id": null, "body": "     Can this week's climate talks in Bonn come up with a draft text for COP 21 in Paris to suit all parties? DW talks to UN climate chief Christiana Figueres.  UN diplomats are meeting in Bonn this week for climate change talks. The five-day session is the last meeting before heads of states and ministers gather in Paris in December to try to sign a deal to combat the threat posed by global climate change.  DW: How important are these talks in Bonn in preparing the way for the Paris climate conference? Christiana Figueres: These talks are critically important on the path toward Paris because it is the last formal session where countries formally get together to listen to each other and to come to common ground. We do not expect a final solution here, but we certainly expect that they will be coming closer together.  Developing countries have expressed dissatisfaction over the latest draft of the global climate agreement, saying many of the core issues have been removed. How confident are you that the talks this week will result in a draft text for Paris that all parties accept? We heard first from the developing countries that they were unhappy with the content of the draft text. The fact is that all countries were very appreciative and happy that it was a short, concise and comprehensive text. However, we also heard from developing and developed countries that they felt the text had gone from being too detailed to being too short. The exercise yesterday was the first attempt to find a happy middle ground between too much and too little. That will now be the work of this week.  Expectations for the Paris climate summit, COP 21, are high. How optimistic are you that a global climate agreement will be reached? We continue to be very optimistic. The fact is that every single country continues to increase its political will and its commitment to reach a Paris agreement, otherwise they wouldn't be working here very hard this week.  What happens if international agreement isn't achieved? It's not a scenario that we entertain.  Will the climate agreement still go ahead, even if some countries don't agree to it? This is an agreement that is so fundamental, and that is going to have such an effect on the global economy, that it is necessary for all countries to feel comfortable with it.  Some developing and emerging nations still need a lot of convincing to agree to cut their emissions. What has to happen to bring them all on board?  The fact is that we already have 154 national climate change plans, so that means there are at least 154 countries that have already identified where they would have opportunities for reducing their emissions. Many of them also see where they're going to need to adapt to the negative effects of climate change. So that's already 86 percent of global emissions, 75 percent of countries, and we expect that we will be receiving more of these national climate change plans throughout the next months.  What strategies have you found helpful in getting world leaders to take action on climate change? It's actually pretty simple. The \"magic wand\", if there were one, is for each of these countries to understand that this is not just a global agenda. Most of the measures of climate action, if not all of them, also have a very fundamental, beneficial effect on the countries presenting them. So the very positive overlap between national development agenda and global agenda is actually what is moving countries forward.  How can poorer countries be better assisted in their transition to low-carbon economies?  I think the poorest countries need two very urgent supports. The first and the most urgent is support for the adaptation that they are already engaging in, because all of these countries are already being affected negatively by climate change. And they certainly need more urgent support, both financial as well as technical, for the adaptation measures that they are already facing. They are receiving some, but clearly not enough. The second is that many of these countries realize that they do not want to be stuck in a global economy that belongs in the last century. They want to move forward with the rest of the countries, and that means decoupling their economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. And that decoupling is also something that needs financial and technical support.  What are the key political issues left to negotiate? The whole package. I wouldn't say that there is one issue that is already clear and done. The fact is that in these negotiations, things move with each other in consonance. So you do not have a prematurely ripe decision or agreement on any of the issues. All issues remain on the table and they are all moving forward together. That means mitigation, or reduction of emissions, adaptation, finance, technology, capacity building, transparency, to name the six most salient of the texts, are still all on the table.  Do you think you can convince all of the world's leaders to act on climate change? They're convincing themselves, because they are truly understanding that it is in their benefit to do so. The incentive is further security, further safety. They do not want to be exposed to the very difficult physical risks that would be upon them should we not address climate change, and should we go to scenarios of really unprecedented natural disasters. So they are understanding that a) it is in their interests to minimize their individual and collective risk. But b) they also have a huge incentive to work toward better health conditions, more energy security, more food security, more water security \u2013 all of these benefits that come with climate change action.  Your job is, in part, to try to convince 195 states to make a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. How does it feel to have this level of responsibility? It is not an individual responsibility. This is a responsibility shared by all countries. Because it is they who make this decision. They are facing these challenges, they make the decisions, they determine the pace, they determine the timing, so it is very much a collective effort.  Current pledges are not enough to limit a rise in temperature to 2 degrees Celsius - seen as the threshold for damaging weather events. If we do get an agreement in Paris, what else needs to happen to meet the 2 degree target?  The agreement in Paris would not be able to be reached if we don't incorporate the path towards a progressively increasing level of effort on the part not only of national governments but of all actors, all stakeholders, including some national governments, private sector, even civil society. Because it is a shared responsibility that goes beyond national governments, so Paris will have both the recognition of current efforts and the path towarsd finally getting on to the 2 degree track.  Is the Climate Summit in Paris in December really our last hope to save the world from catastrophic climate change? It is the last opportunity to do so in a cost effective manner. Global greenhouse gas emissions in theory could continue to increase over the next few decades. But then, we will have no other option but to reduce global greenhouse emissions at a much higher cost.  To date, looking back over the past decades, what have we achieved on the issue of climate? What did you learn from Copenhagen? We learnt a lot from Copenhagen: certainly how not to keep delegates out in the cold for five hours waiting to get in, so that doesn't happen anymore. But the most fundamental lesson from Copenhagen is that action on climate change needs to make sense from a national perspective. It cannot be only the global arguments. The global arguments stay on the table and they are shared by all, but it does need to make sense from a national perspective.  Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since July 2010. She has directed five consecutive Conferences of the Parties, and is now charged with the intergovernmental process to deliver the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.  The interview was conducted by Charlotta Lomas. Developing nations are crying foul over the latest draft of a global climate agreement to be inked in Paris. A rift has opened between developing and developed countries on how to share the task of curbing emissions.

{"id": null, "body": "     Scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are meeting to finalize the third part of its first major climate assessment in seven years. But what exactly is the IPCC? The IPCC presents options to mitigate the damage and adapt to climate change Its findings influence governments, business leaders and even\u00a0 young protesters \u00a0on one of the biggest issues facing the planet: the climate crisis.\u00a0 But many people may never have heard of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \u00a0 The\u00a0 IPCC \u00a0is a UN body that evaluates climate science. It brings together leading scientists to study climate change and how it is reshaping the world. It also explores solutions to cut emissions and adapt to a hotter planet. Founded in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, the IPCC produces major assessments every few years. The reports are dense documents thousands of pages long \u2014 but are accompanied by summaries for policymakers that are intended for a broader readership. To write these reports, the IPCC selects hundreds of scientists from across the world to evaluate peer-reviewed scientific literature and, less often, government and industry reports. In that sense, none of the findings in the reports are new.  The scientists consider t housands of studies when writing their assessments.\u00a0 \u00a0 The most recent publication is the IPCC's sixth assessment report. It published the first installment on the physical science of climate change in August 2021. The second section, on the effects and adaptation, was released in February. The third section on slowing climate change and cutting emissions is out in April. It will be completed by a synthesis report published in September.\u00a0 The sixth assessment comes after a series of special reports published in 2018 and 2019 that covered projections for life on a planet that will have warmed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), and the effects of climate change o n\u00a0 land ,\u00a0 oceans and icy places. The special report on 1.5 C of warming is credited with forcing journalists to pay more attention to climate change. \u00a0\u00a0 Delegates and experts gathered in 2017 to discuss special reports on climate impacts across land, sea and ice IPCC climate scientists stress that they do not tell governments what to do, but rather assess different pathways they could take. In UN jargon, they say they are \" policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive.\"\u00a0 They also say their conclusions for the future are projections \u2014 based on different warming scenarios \u2014 rather than predictions. \u00a0 The summaries for policymakers they publish with each report are prepared by experts and reviewed line-by-line in marathon plenary sessions by UN member states who must then unanimously approve them. These documents guide decision-makers.\u00a0 \u00a0 But while the science in the reports themselves is left entirely to the experts, the inclusion of governments in the review process has raised criticisms this lets politicians water down the conclusions. For instance, the sixth assessment report on the physical science of climate change did not mention the words \"fossil fuels\" in its 40-page summary for policymakers because Saudi Arabia successfully lobbied to remove it. \u00a0\u00a0 IPCC authors stress that they can \u2014 and do \u2014 push back on comments that are not justified by the science. Among scientists, t h e reports are viewed as the most comprehensive and reliable assessments of climate change.\u00a0 In 2007, the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. \u00a0 This is an updated version of a previous article. A wildfire that burned through at least 7,780 hectares (30 square miles) in about a week and devastated forests in southern Spain was brought under control thanks to steady rains. The downpour helped the firefighters, who were backed by some 50 aircrafts. The blaze was one of the most difficult to combat in recent times in Spain. Some 2,600 people were forced to flee their homes. Unprecedented flooding \u2014 caused by two months' worth of rainfall in two days \u2014 has resulted in devastating damage in central Europe, leaving at least 226 people dead in Germany and Belgium. Narrow valley streams swelled into raging floods in the space of hours, wiping out centuries-old communities. Rebuilding the ruined homes, businesses and infrastructure is expected to cost billions of euros. While half of Europe is drowning, elsewhere areas are going up in flames: Large fires raged, particularly in Greece, Italy and Turkey. They have caused unforeseeable monetary damage, while thousands of people in Europe have lost their homes and their belongings. In addition to deadly wildfires, Italy also battled record heat temperatures, with the Italian Health Ministry issuing the maximum possible heat warning level for many cities. On the island of Sicily, 48.8 degrees Celsius (almost 120 degrees Fahrenheit) was measured on August 11 \u2014 a new European heat record. The heat could make existing fires worse, or lead to new ones. Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire continues smoldering in California. It's California's largest fire on record, and among the most destructive in the state's history \u2014 it wiped the town of Greenville off the map. Although it's about 60% contained, the fire continues to burn two months in. Meanwhile, hot and dry conditions continue in the region, spreading fears of more fire. Earlier this summer, record floods also hit parts of India and central China, overwhelming dams and drains and flooding streets. The downpours have been particularly heavy, even for the rainy season. Scientists have predicted that climate change will lead to more frequent and intense rainfall \u2014 warmer air holds more water, creating more rain. As nations flood in northern Europe, Mediterranean countries like Greece were in the grip of several heat waves. In the first week of July, temperatures soared to 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit). Tourism hot spots like the Acropolis were forced to shut during the day, while the extreme heat also sparked forest fires outside Thessaloniki, which helicopters tried to douse. \"It is an unprecedented reality in Sardinia\u2019s history,\" said Sardinia's Governor Christian Salinas of the ongoing wildfires that have scorched the historic central western area of Montiferru. \"So far, 20,000 hectares of forest that represent centuries of environmental history of our island have gone up in ashes.\" Around 1,500 people were evacuated from the island by the end of July. Intense heat is becoming more common, as seen in late June in the US states of Washington and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Scorching temperatures under a \"heat dome,\" hot air trapped for days by high pressure fronts, caused hundreds of heat-related deaths. The village of Lytton recorded a high of 49.6 Celsius (121 Fahrenheit) \u2014 and burned to the ground the next day. Heat and drought are fueling one of the most intense wildfire seasons in the West Coast and Pacific Northwest regions. Oregon's Bootleg Fire, which burned an area the size of Los Angeles in just two weeks, was so big it created its own weather and sent smoke all the way to New York City. A recent study said the weather conditions would have been \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. To the south, central Brazil is suffering its worst drought 100 years, increasing the risk of fires and further deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Researchers recently reported that a large swath of the southeastern Amazon has flipped from absorbing to emitting planet-warming CO2 emissions, pushing the rainforest closer to a \"tipping point.\" After years of unrelenting drought, more than 1.14 million people in Madagascar are food-insecure, with some now forced to eat raw cactus, wild leaves and roots, and locusts in famine-like conditions. With the absence of natural disaster, crop failure or political conflict, the dire situation in the African nation is said to be first famine in modern history caused solely by climate change. The number of people fleeing conflict and natural disasters hit a 10-year high in 2020, with a record 55 million people relocating within their own country. That's in addition to some 26 million people who fled across borders. A joint report released by refugee monitors in May found that three-quarters of the internally displaced were victims of extreme weather \u2014 and that number is likely to grow.

{"id": null, "body": "     The head of the Catholic Church is poised to focus on ecology in release of a key document. Activists around the world say it's already spurring action - among the faithful, and beyond. It also has its detractors. Pope Franics in Manila in January, where he explicitly linked climate change to human activity Anticipation is mounting as one of the world's most important public figures prepares to convey a key message on ecology and the environment that could have a profound impact on the way 1.2 billion Catholics think about their relationship with the planet. Some believe it could even be a game-changer in the global struggle to deal with climate change. Pope Francis' upcoming encyclical on ecology, due to be published Thursday, June 18, is expected to portray climate change as fundamentally connected to human rights and the plight of the world's poorest citizens, and to stress an urgent need for action. \"It means making change that leads to simpler, fuller lives, when we don't just consume resources like crazy,\" Lonnie Ellis, associate director of the Catholic Climate Covenant told DW. \"But it also means advocating and trying to change systems and laws. Francis has been pretty clear that we need to move away from a throwaway culture and an economy of exclusion.\" Francis has been hailed as a superstar pope. The first non-European to be installed in the Vatican in more than a millennium, he has been outspoken on poverty and human rights, championing the marginalized and entertaining the faithful with a series of headline-grabbing one-liners. And he hasn't shied away from forceful criticism of powerful ideologies of the day, from free market economics to consumer culture. Speaking at a Caritas event in New York last month, Francis warned that the powerful would face God's judgment if they failed to preserve the earth so that it can support all the world's people. He has previously called exploitation of the environment a sin. Now the encyclical - described as a policy paper for the Catholic faith - intends to put environmental protection at the heart of religious practice.  Solar-powered churches A papal encyclical - among the most important forms of Vatican communication - addresses a key aspect of Catholic doctrine Eco-conscious Catholics say it is already having an impact - even before publication. \"We are getting so many more requests to come to schools and parishes and give talks about care for creation - there is so much buzz about this,\" said Ellis, who believes the faithful are ready to address the issue on a spiritual level.  \"All this talk about the science - all the charts and graphs out there - I think people are hungering for a different kind of conversation about the moral issues at stake here.\" Jeffry Odell Korgen, a lay Catholic ecclesial minister who works with the interfaith environmental group GreenFaith, pointed to signs in the US that environmental action is becoming a matter of faith. \"More and more churches are installing solar panels on their roofs,\" Korgen told DW. \"Improving energy efficiency now says something about moral practice and putting faith into action.\" Teresa Berger, a professor of theology at Yale School of Divinity, is planning to begin generating her own green power, too. \"I think the encyclical will have different impacts in different contexts - for me it will mean putting solar panels on my house - finally,\" she told DW. \"With the papal encyclical coming out I said: The time is now.\" Berger says that while stewardship of god's creation and care for the poor have always been at the heart of Catholic teaching, she expects Francis to convey a clear and compelling ecological message. She would like to see his followers in the US respond by, for example, abandoning their cars to get to Sunday Mass. Less than half of Americans view climate change as a major threat, and activists there hope the pontiff's message will convince people of the urgency of the problem. In other parts of the world, the document will be seen as an important affirmation of problems the public is only too aware of.  Courage to take a stand \"In many parts of Argentina and Latin America, there is a lot of concern over actions that are having a huge environmental impact,\" said Pablo Canziani, a climate scientist working with Accion Catolica Argentina, pointing to large-scale mining projects and monoculture cultivation of genetically modified crops as major issues. Francis is also hugely popular in his native Argentina, which globally has among the highest rates of public concern over climate change \"These kind of activities are being done without any purpose of fostering development, but purely in the service of greed. The only way to change this is through strong moral leadership,\" Canziani said. Aside from taking a stand against one of the seven deadly sins, this could spur people to put greater pressure on politicians regarding environmental issues and human rights - and help give legitimacy to protestors defending both. \"Sometimes people are afraid of taking a stand on something that affects them. This encyclical will give them courage,\" he told DW. In the Philippines as well, humankind's impact on the planet is no longer an abstract concept, with a link drawn between climate change and typhoons that have devastated the country in recent years. As Typhoon Hagupit approached the Philippines in December, the Archbishop of Manila called on churches to pray for safety - and for forgiveness for sins against creation. But Lou Arsenio of Archdiocese of Manila Ecology Ministry says more must be done to educate people about \"the connection between ecology and spirituality.\" \"We have had difficulty getting people to see ecology as major concern, despite the fact we are having many problems because of climate change,\" she told DW. \"We are hoping that the encyclical will open the eyes of many of our priests as well as lay people.\"  Ruffling feathers on the right But not everyone in the Catholic Church is looking forward to the document. Some conservative commentators have accused the pope of jumping on the \"bandwagon\" of the global environmental movement, or of straying from his area of expertise. Earlier this month, US presidential candidate Rick Santorum, a Catholic Republican who has argued against gay rights, contraception and abortion, said the church should leave science to the scientists and focus on theology and morality. Francis has a history of ruffling feathers on the political right. His first apostolic exhortation in 2013 criticized global capitalism and free market economics, challenging the \"trickle down\" theory that society as a whole benefits from economic growth. Pope Francis choose his papal name based on Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of ecology Advocates of the pope's stance on the environment point out that Jesus Christ himself upset the status quo. Some say controversy should be welcomed. \"That's what so exciting,\" Korgen told DW, stressing that the pope has framed environmental protection as very much a moral issue. \"Wherever we stand on the political spectrum, it is important to look in particular for these parts that challenge us, and engage with that challenge.\"  Inspiring others The document will be released in various languages, and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon along with climate change campaigners around the word have already welcomed it as an important signal ahead of UN climate talks in Paris later this year. And a time when ever more people are directly affected by the impacts of climate change - and pressure mounts on religious institutions to take the lead on issues such as divesting from fossil fuels - Korgen is convinced the encyclical will send ripples beyond the global Catholic community. \"I think it will spur action,\" Korgen said. Pope Francis and millions in Manila gathered for an outdoor Mass on the last full day of the pontiff's trip. He read a brief prayer in English to the vast crowd in the capital of the predominantly Catholic country.

{"id": null, "body": "     Rapid decarbonization of energy is non-negotiable if we are to avert catastrophic global heating, says the latest UN climate report. Wildfire intensity is set to get much worse unless heat-trappings emissions are cut very soon In the final part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's ( IPCC ) sixth assessment on the state of global warming \u2014 themed on climate mitigation \u2014 the message is clear: The window for keeping heating below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and limiting catastrophic climate impacts, including\u00a0worsening wildfires and flooding , has become very small. Following on from earlier UN reports on the science of climate change , and impacts and adaptation , the latest edition details the means to fix the problem. Paramount is a more ambitious phase-out of fossil fuels responsible for two-thirds of planet-warming carbon emissions since 1850; and the concurrent electrification of a global energy system powered largely by wind and the sun\u00a0\u2014 the cost of renewables has declined up to 85% since 2010, notes the report.\u00a0 \"There's no magic bullet but there's a smoking gun, and that's fossil fuels,\" said Nikki Reich, director of the\u00a0Climate & Energy Program\u00a0at the Washington, DC-headquartered Center for International Environmental Lawyers. The IPCC offers mitigation pathways to achieve\u00a0\"immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors,\" meaning\u00a0around a 50%\u00a0cut\u00a0in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\u00a0(relative to 2019 levels)\u00a0by the end of this decade.\u00a0 Campaigners had hoped the report would decline to promote\u00a0carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies to reverse a carbon budget blow-out. However,\u00a0 carbon capture and storage (CCS), though unproven at scale, remains a fall-back option. \u00a0 Protecting\u00a0 forests and\u00a0 biodiversity \u2014 which provide vital CO2 sinks \u2014 and improved building efficiency and transport electrification are\u00a0essential parts of the mitigation pathways outlined in the 3000-odd page report.\u00a0 An increase in public sector\u00a0 climate finance \u00a0and an equitable and just transition for poorer countries with low per capita emissions will also be vital\u00a0for meeting global mitigation goals.\u00a0 No nation is currently on track to meet the Paris targets of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius \u2014 and ideally below 1.5C. The targets in the current National Climate Plans (NDCs) are equivalent to about 3.2C of warming this century. Extreme weather \u00a0and ice melt \u00a0across the Arctic are already being felt with only around 1.2C of heating \u00a0since pre-industrial times. Warming cannot be limited to 1.5C unless emissions peak by 2025, said the report. Global net zero CO2 emissions also need to be reached by the early 2050s. The latest IPCC report aims to give governments the justification to set necessary emission reduction targets. Thirty-two\u00a0years since the IPCC's first climate report, emissions have risen by 54%, according to the climate body. \"This latest IPCC report puts policymakers on notice, yet again, that the current global trajectory of heat-trapping emissions is alarmingly off-track,\" said Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at the Washington, D.C.-based Union of Concerned Scientists \u2014 and an official observer of the climate mitigation report. \"Their continued inaction is directly responsible for the climate crisis already here, and it has also placed the goals of the Paris Agreement at grave risk,\" she added. \"A faster fossil fuel phase-out really needs to happen,\" said Linda Schneider, senior program officer for International Climate Policy at the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation in Berlin. Renewables technology exists, but needs to be massively ramped up 100% wind and solar energy combined with biodiversity restoration and \"demand-side\" measures included in the report\u00a0\u2014 such as low-carbon\u00a0vegetarian diets and reduced consumption in the global north \u2014 need to form part of government mitigation policy, said Schneider. Some of the mitigation pathways included in the report factor in\u00a0\"negative emission\" technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage ( BECCS ) \u2014 by which trees feed power plants whose emissions will be captured at a future date when the technology is available. The practice is regarded as carbon negative\u00a0by the IPCC, and the EU, because the trees that feed the bioenergy plants are deemed sustainable\u00a0\u2014 even if a large amount of forest and agricultural land will be lost to\u00a0support the\u00a0necessary tree plantations.\u00a0 Moreover, carbon capture technology remains at the pilot stage and is not \"a real world solution,\" said Schneider. \"The [report's] central climate mitigation strategy \u2014 phasing out all fossil fuels, starting immediately \u2014 is often diluted by references to technofixes that are meant to keep the fossil fuel industry alive,\" she added. Reliance on unproven CDR technologies also threatens a temporary \"overshoot\" of the 1.5C warming limit. Stopping deforestation is key to climate change mitigation The implication is that temperatures will be lower again once CDR technologies come on board. But it could already be too late if irreversible \"tipping points\" have been triggered, Schneider explained, including the thawing of permafrost regions that are massive carbon sinks \u2014 causing additional emissions that would greatly accelerate the climate crisis. There is a concern that\u00a0CDR will be\u00a0a means to postpone immediate emission cuts. \"To avoid worst case scenarios and unmanageable impacts, the promise of negative emissions at some future point in time must not be used as an excuse to delay action on efficiency and the deployment of renewables now,\" said Taylor Dimsdale, director of risk and resilience at global climate think tank, E3G. \"It's very uncertain if we can even return to 1.5,\" said Schneider of the overshoot scenarios, noting that \"feedbacks and tipping points could even happen before 1.5 degrees is reached.\" For Alexandre K\u00f6berle, a research fellow at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, and a lead author of the latest IPCC publication, the calculated cost of mitigation \u00a0in the report needed\u00a0to account for \"the impacts that we would avoid if we tackle climate change.\" Mitigation costs in the report are again measured in terms of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) \u2014 a measurement that\u00a0IPCC Working Group III Co-Chair Priyadarshi Shukla\u00a0concedes does not take into account \"the economic benefits of reduced adaptation costs or avoided climate impacts.\" Nonetheless, GDP would be \"just a few percentage points lower in 2050 if we take the actions necessary to limit warming to 2\u00b0C,\" according to Shukla.\u00a0 Yet\u00a0K\u00f6berle\u00a0says GDP is an \"awful metric\" that will not give necessary clarity for politicians wanting to convince the public of the benefits of a full energy transition. The\u00a0\"co-benefits\" of mitigation policies\u00a0such as\u00a0reduced air pollution and improved respiratory health\u00a0are also not counted, he notes; nor is\u00a0energy sovereignty and reduced dependence on external energy suppliers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0especially at a time when Europe is trying to reduce its dependence on\u00a0Russian gas and oil. The IPCC will now finalize its mammoth sixth assessment, the first since 2014, for release in September\u00a0on the eve of COP27\u00a0\u2014\u00a0when governments are expected to update their NDCs and commit to a more ambitious fossil fuel phase-out. Edited by: Tamsin Walker Small island nations around the world are already feeling the impact of rising sea levels. And probably none more so than the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, which is considered the lowest-elevation country on the planet. The average elevation of its 26 atolls is just 1.5 meters (5 feet) above sea level - so it wouldn't take much for the country to be rendered completely uninhabitable. Rising waters have already caused some islanders to flee their homes for higher ground. On the Kiribati islands in the Pacific, some villages have been completely flooded. Local farmers also have to worry about encroachment of saltwater on their crops. The ever-approaching sea means less surface area for agriculture, and a greater need to transport food from afar. Around 113,000 people call the Kiribati islands home. Locals who've been displaced often end up on the main island of South Tarawa, which has a sea wall to protect low-lying properties on the shore from rising waters - but that's no permanent solution. The Dutch are famous for their efforts to fend off the sea - they built their first dikes to protect land from flooding more than 1,000 years ago. Today, a sophisticated system of dams and dikes allows two-thirds of the population live below sea level. Nevertheless, rising ocean levels are still a concern in the Netherlands, where there are future plans to fortify levees and build surge barriers. Venice in northeastern Italy is no stranger to flooding - and according to experts, the iconic city will continue to sink. The Italian government has invested 9.6 billion euros ($7 billion) in the \"Moses\" water barrier project, designed to protect the city - a UNESCO World Heritage site - from rising oceans and high tides. The barriers are expected to be completed by 2016. Many small islands in far-flung corners of the ocean don't have the money to fund large-scale climate change mitigation. And often, they're not just facing rising seas - they're also under threat from increasingly frequent cyclones and hurricanes. In the Caribbean islands of St. Lucia and Dominica, frequent storms wreak havoc on local agriculture, including bananas and avocados. The devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines last November is a clear example of how the unpredictability of climate change can make weather events more severe for islands. Many homes in the typhoon\u2019s path weren\u2019t built to withstand typhoons, which previously tended to strike the north of the country. More than 6,200 people were killed. Some argue that poorer, less-developed countries are now suffering as a consequence of Western industrialization. At the recent climate conference in Warsaw, Philippines Commissioner Yeb Sa\u00f1o made a passionate plea for action, saying: \"What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness.\" Although Bangladesh is on the mainland of Asia, it faces a huge risk from climate change due to its low-lying geography and population density. A mere 1-meter (3-foot) rise in sea level would cause half the country to be under water. Communities have started adapting to increased flooding by using floating agricultural technology to grow their crops. There are fears sea level rises could eventually displace entire populations, creating hoards of climate change refugees. One idea floated by President Anote Tong of Kiribati some years ago was the possibility of building artificial islands for displaced locals to live on. Dubai - with its artificial island projects, like the one pictured here - may be able to help by sharing its experience.

{"id": null, "body": "     Scientists have been able to more directly link extreme weather, like the floods that hit Central Europe last month, to climate change. A changed climate could also mean hotter summers - and with that, more deaths. Bye-bye idyllic summers? Climate change is set to make summers full of extreme weather Europe's summer got off to a torrential start this year as severe flooding struck much of the continent. At least 18 people were killed in May 2016 in the heavy downpours and ensuing floods that hit France, Germany, Belgium and Romania. The River Seine in France burst its banks as waters reached their highest levels in more than 30 years, while in the German state of Bavaria, surging floodwaters crushed houses and cars, forcing some residents to climb to safety on their rooftops. Holidaymakers planning trips to Europe may well have second thoughts, while locals are asking whether climate change is playing a role. According to researchers, the answer - at least in France - was: probably. Scientists with the research program World Weather Attribution (WWA) analyzed the heavy rain and flooding in France and Germany in May to investigate the likelihood of whether climate change contributed to it. Robert Vautard, a senior scientist with France's Laboratory for Climate and Environment Sciences and Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace, who was involved in the research, said: \"We know that global warming leads to more downpours in general. But with this attribution analysis, we found we could tie global warming directly to the recent rainstorms in France that triggered so much flooding and destruction.\" Although the results were inconclusive about climate change's link to the floods in Germany, Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: \"These latest lethal floods in Europe illustrate the rising impact of extreme weather events, including on developed and well-prepared countries like Germany and France.\" Days of almost nonstop rain in Paris, France, led to the River Seine bursting its banks at the start of this summer Shifts in understanding The study is one of the latest in a growing number associating climate change more directly with extreme weather, suggesting that a previous hesitation over linking the two is waning. Van Aalst told DW that this shift gradually emerged in the scientific community over the last 10 years, essentially by researchers changing the question they were asking. \"The question 10 years ago was, 'Is this heat wave a climate change event,'\" said van Aalst. Scientists are thinking more in terms of how likely it is that a weather phenomenon was caused by climate change. More research has since been focused on looking at weather extremes through the growing scientific field of climate change \"attribution.\" Attribution studies aim to determine the causes of single, unusual climate-related events - and to understand how humans are influencing the climate by looking at whether climate change has made particular extreme weather events stronger or more likely. Drawing a line For Kerry Emanuel, a professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the switch to looking at the probability of climate change affecting a particular weather event is a correct one. \"We cannot and should not say that a particular heat wave was caused by global warming,\" he told DW. But we can say that the probability of such an event is different today than in the pre-industrial era, he added. Heat waves have become increasingly more common in Europe - with climate change being increasingly linked But not all extreme weather events are associated with human-related climate change, and unusual extremes have always been a part of a variable climate. The challenge for scientists is to disentangle natural factors from human-caused factors. As Emanuel warned, \"there is a temptation to attribute every extreme event to global warming, just as in the 1980s every extreme event was blamed on El Ni\u00f1o.\" In the latter case, a few of those attributions were correct, he said. \"This temptation must be avoided.\" Lovers of hot summers rejoice For people craving sun during their summer getaways in Europe, these climate change-linked extremes may spell a higher chance of intense downpours but also heat waves in some parts of Europe, particularly the Mediterranean. It was \"virtually certain\" that climate change increased the likelihood of the heat wave that swept countries across Europe in the summer of 2015, according to a team of international scientists that included the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies' specialist reference center on climate change. Jeff Knight, a research scientist at the Met Office - the United Kingdom's national weather service - told DW that the summer climate has warmed across Europe by more than 1 degree Celsius since 1900, with most of this warming attributable to human-caused changes, mainly emission of greenhouse gases. \"This change has already dramatically increased the frequency of heat waves,\" he told DW. \"The European summer climate is expected to warm further in future.\" Some holidaymakers may welcome the increase in European heat waves - but they could be deadly to the elderly How prepared is Europe for extreme summer weather? Sun-seekers may welcome the high bursts of heat - but for others, very high temperatures in a continent poorly adapted to cope with them could be deadly. Van Aalst told DW that in Europe, hospitals and old people's homes generally aren't air-conditioned, and that people don't drink enough water because they aren't accustomed to such hot weather. This puts the elderly and chronically ill in particular at risk. Although Europe may not be perfectly equipped to handle extreme weather events, it is relatively well prepared compared to countries with fewer resources, namely in the developing world. \"In the Paris floods, the Louvre moved its artworks out, so that shows how organized it was,\" he told DW. \"But in other countries, not even people [much less artworks] are protected so well.\" Temperatures across Europe were expected to smash records this week as the current heat wave showed no signs of abating. While some enjoyed the sun, deaths and forest fires marred the increasingly tropical summer.

Environmental activists dancing and playing music were joined by grandmothers and families with children as people from all different walks of life came together to protest in an atmosphere akin to a festival. But the message was much more serious and very clear: \"Climate Action Now!,\" read one sign. \"One Earth = One Chance,\" said another.

Her comments echoed those of Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg. \"People want everything to continue like now, and they are afraid of change and change is what we young people are bringing,\" she said. \"That is why they want to silence us, and that is just the proof that we are having an impact, that our voices are being heard, that they try so desperately to silence us.\" Establishing Paris accord ground rules Friday's protest took place just miles away from where representatives from all over the world are meeting over two weeks at the United Nation's COP25 climate conference to discuss measures to decrease carbon emissions as part of the Paris Agreement. Under the accord, ratified by almost 200 countries, nations have drawn up their own targets to reduce carbon emissions with the aim of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. In the four years since the agreement was made in 2015, negotiators have been working on the so-called \"rule book\" \u2014 a set of regulations that will govern the implementation of the Paris agreement set to take place next year. Read more:\u00a0 How satellites will help solve the climate crisis But clashes among countries over how to monitor their emissions and proposed carbon markets have hindered the process. \"We have to unite as a global team, otherwise we won't manage to solve this climate crisis, which is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced,\" said Jenny, who came from Germany to participate in the Madrid demonstration. \"Governments are not doing enough, so we as civil society have to take the lead.\" Funding to help developing countries to adapt to climate change and pay for the damage that has already been inflicted is also another sticking point in negotiations. The world will need to pull together for real change to happen, protesters said Unambitious national targets Meanwhile, experts have said that national targets to reduce their emissions are not ambitious enough to be in line with the Paris Agreement and would potentially see a temperature rise of at least 3 degrees Celsius. \"We can achieve a change if we act all together, but we need to really engage,\" said Spanish protester Pilar, who was at the protest with her husband and daughter. \"We need money to stop being the most important thing, to have companies that only seek economic benefit with no limit. If we unite, we can achieve the necessary change.\" Global leaders are set to descend on the COP25 climate conference for the second week of negotiations, but whether their attendance will lead to higher ambitions and the change protesters are calling for remains to be seen. What is clear is that for protesters like 15-year-old Danny, only action will give her the life that others have had before her and that she desperately wants her own children someday to enjoy. \"I want to offer a bright future to my children,\" she said. \"I want them to be able to drink clean water and breathe clean air.\" The summer of 2019 saw heat records in Europe broken across the continent. In July, Germany recorded its highest temperature ever at 42.6 C (108 F). France broke its heat record twice in 2019, the highest temperature measuring 46.C (114.8 F) in July. Climate change increases the frequency of heat waves. In November 2019, the Italian archipelago city of Venice experienced multiple flooding events and the high water mark of 1.5 meters was reached three times in one week for the first time in recorded history. Projected sea level rise due to climate change could make these events more likely in the future. The same heat wave that brought record temperatures to France sparked the worst wildfires to hit Spain in 20 years. On the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, wildfires in August decimated a national park on the popular tourist island. Hotter temperatures and drier air due to climate change increase the risk of fires. A combination of drought, storms and extreme heat is depleting Germany's forests. According to BDF, a forest advocacy group, in Germany, more than 1 million established trees have died since 2018. \"These are no longer single unusual weather events. That is climate change,\" said a BDF representative. A glacier on the Italian side of Mont Blanc experienced accelerated melting in 2019. And enthusiasts held a \"funeral\" for the Pizol glacier in the Swiss Alps, which has almost completely disappeared. Scientists say climate change accelerates glacial melting in the Alps. Two consecutive years of drought in Germany have hit farmers hard. In 2018, record drought caused major crop failures, and heat waves in 2019 also damaged crops. \"Climate change means more frequent droughts and extreme weather events in Germany,\"said German Weather Service Vice President Paul Becker. In an effort to cut carbon emissions, the EU established a cap-and-trade system 15 years ago. So far, it hasn\u2019t had much impact. So how does it work, and how can it be made more effective?

{"id": null, "body": "     The UN's scientific body on climate change highlights in a new report the strong connection between land use and climate change. A radical change in the food system is key to people's livelihoods and health worldwide. The earth's population is growing and, with it, consumption.\u00a0This trend will only increase in the\u00a0near future, but the\u00a0planet's resources are\u00a0limited, and land isn't an exception. The stark connection between how land is used and its effect on climate change is the focus of the\u00a0 latest report\u00a0 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published on August 8. At the center of the report is how, in a sort of vicious circle, unhealthy soils and forests\u00a0exacerbate climate change, while climate change, in turn, negatively impacts\u00a0the forests and soils' health. The IPCC's findings are\u00a0the result of two years of work by\u00a0103 experts from 52 countries who were\u00a0involved on a voluntary basis. Before its release, the report was\u00a0discussed with governments in Geneva, Switzerland, and\u00a0approved by\u00a0consensus by\u00a0all participating IPCC member countries. The report doesn't paint a promising future:\u00a0If global warming goes beyond\u00a0the 2 degrees Celsius\u00a0limit set forth in the Paris Agreement, what will likely happen is that fruitful land\u00a0will turn to desert, infrastructure will crumble as permafrost thaws, and drought and extreme weather events will\u00a0put\u00a0the food system at\u00a0risk. It's a grim picture, but IPCC authors stress that the report's recommendations could help governments prevent the worst damage by reducing\u00a0pressure on land \u00a0and making food systems more sustainable, while meeting the needs of a growing population. \"My hope is that this report will have some impact on how we regard land in the context of climate change and it will have an impact on policies that will promote sustainable land management and\u00a0sustainable food systems,\" Alisher\u00a0Mirzabaev told DW, a co-author of the IPCC report who spoke on his own behalf.\u00a0 Key findings of the report: The report predicts falling water levels and an increasing incidence of desertification as the world continues to heat up Carbon sinks or CO2 emitters\u00a0 Soils and forests\u00a0 are perfect allies against climate change. They act as carbon sinks, natural reservoirs that\u00a0prevent CO2 from reaching the atmosphere. As Barron Joseph Orr, lead scientist for the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification points out, unsustainable management turns them into the opposite: major contributors to climate change.\u00a0 Of the world's land area that isn't covered by ice, roughly 70% is already being used for food production, textiles\u00a0and fuel. Ecosystems such as grasslands\u00a0are pivotal for a stable climate, although often ignored. These vast landscapes, which are largely devoid of trees and shrubs,\u00a0act as\u00a0huge carbon sinks. They also\u00a0allow\u00a0cattle to graze without cutting down trees. But the trend toward developing this land for crops means a larger\u00a0release of CO2 into the atmosphere. \"While much attention goes towards forests, savannahs and grasslands are a landscape that we must urgently address,\"\u00a0Joao Campari, global food practice leader at WWF International, told DW. \"More than 50%\u00a0of the conversion for fruitful production happens in grasslands and savannahs.\" Peatlands , for instance, a sort of wetland that covers only\u00a03% of the Earth's surface, are also another important carbon sink, yet make up to 5% of annual global CO2 emissions. About 15%\u00a0of known peatlands\u00a0are already either destroyed or degraded.\u00a0 Dire consequences\u00a0 The report goes on to outline how our\u00a0food system greatly contributes\u00a0to climate change, but is also heavily affected by its consequences. Crop yields are predicted to\u00a0decrease due to climate change and food prices are expected to\u00a0increase accordingly.\u00a0Global cereal prices could rise by as much as 23% by 2050, the IPCC report says.\u00a0 In the US, climate change could lower corn and soybean\u00a0production\u00a0by up to 80% in the next 60 years if emissions continue to rise, Campari told DW, citing\u00a0 a previous report by the United States Department of Agriculture. A report by the Asian Development Bank\u00a0 has also warned of a decline in staple crops. In southern India, for example, rice yields may decline by 5% in 2030 and by more than\u00a014% over the next three decades. The rise in extreme weather events threatens to disrupt\u00a0food chains, with food loss driving up prices.\u00a0One-third of\u00a0food produced every year\u00a0 is already lost or wasted . Food waste and loss \u2013 from the energy that goes into producing food to the food\u00a0that rots in landfills\u00a0\u2013\u00a0incidentally\u00a0accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0 In addition, higher CO2 concentrations affect food quality and\u00a0 reduce its nutritional value, researchers have found, warning this may also\u00a0contribute to global food insecurity. An estimated\u00a0821\u00a0million people\u00a0suffer from hunger and\u00a01.5 billion\u00a0lack key micronutrients, such as iron or zinc, in their diet. Time for action The IPCC's latest report is not only a warning, it's also a call for action. And a reminder that there's still hope. \"Solutions are available. In many cases it is a matter of a larger scale application,\" IPCC's author Mirzabaev said. Although solutions vary from region to region, they largely overlap. This begins by optimizing\u00a0existing areas for food production and rehabilitating\u00a0the world's 2 billion hectares of already degraded land. \"We need to stop deforestation and converting new land\u00a0to grow food,\u00a0period,\" Campari said. The report also outlines\u00a0measures\u00a0to help soils absorb more carbon and prevent soil erosion,\u00a0such as replacing monocultures \u2013 a single\u00a0crop such as\u00a0soybeans or corn,\u00a0grown over a large land area \u2013 with\u00a0a variety of crops. Healthier soils\u00a0produce more,\u00a0are less vulnerable to\u00a0extreme weather\u00a0and lead to a more stable food supply and income. But experts say such a change cannot happen without policymakers onboard. They must move past the stage of saying they're\u00a0committed to actually implementing concrete measures based on\u00a0the report's recommendations. They must also\u00a0work in an integrated manner involving all sectors, from finance to health. \"There is a perceived competition between generating revenues for a country and keeping a healthy environment, but there is no room for these dilemmas anymore in the 21st century,\" Campari said. Orr points out that planning has traditionally been based on immediate goals.\u00a0If economic development was the goal, biodiversity protection wouldn't be in the plans.\u00a0However, the challenges posed by climate change require a more holistic approach. \"And that changes the whole equation,\" Orr said. \"Where do we put the habitat corridor that will maximize biodiversity but not impact that economic development zone?\u00a0Do we let new urban growth go into prime agricultural land \u2013 which is where it goes\u00a0almost always everywhere in the world\u00a0 \u2013 or do we try to orient it\u00a0towards already degraded land? The IPCC report also calls on policymakers to\u00a0create\u00a0adequate space for people to take risks, for example, by\u00a0 securing land tenure rights \u00a0or\u00a0by incentivizing\u00a0sustainable land management. \"Many of the benefits produced by reforestation programs are in the form of intangible ecosystem services, like carbon sequestration, which are not sold in the market,\"\u00a0Mirzabaev said. Measures like payments for ecosystem services could encourage those actions, he added. A common effort Meanwhile, citizens\u00a0should not\u00a0just sit and wait, experts say.\u00a0It isn't always easy to choose the right path, though. If one\u00a0eats meat, it has an impact. If one\u00a0stops eating meat but buys avocados, it has an impact as well.\u00a0 \"There is no silver bullet,\" Campari\u00a0said. Even so, reducing\u00a0the amount\u00a0of food that ends up in the bin would be a first good step. A greater awareness of what we consume and how we consume it, not to mention a more diverse diet, would also make a difference:\u00a075%\u00a0of the world's food comes from only 12 plants and five animal species. \"Consumers need to be made aware that what they choose to eat\u00a0is not born on a plate. There is labor involved;\u00a0there are\u00a0natural resources involved,\" Campari added.\u00a0\u00a0 According to Orr, a little push to empower consumers wouldn't hurt. Easy ways to track the food impact on land and\u00a0advice at consumer level\u00a0would\u00a0encourage\u00a0more conscientious\u00a0behavior and, in the long run,\u00a0healthier soil and a healthier climate. In any case, the IPCC's latest report shouldn't be a reason to give\u00a0up, but rather to look ahead, he added.\u00a0\"We can talk as long as we want about what's wrong with the world. But right now we need to move, we need to act.\"\u00a0 Some dishes die out over time, but the Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity is working to stop that. Its Ark of Taste catalog helps food products survive by making them popular again and supporting producers unable to compete with industrial products. The catalog already lists 5,000 food products from all over the world, and is open to further nominations. Anyone can suggest traditional local foods, including plants, animal species and transformed products, such as yak cheese and Pokot ash yoghurt, as long as they're artisanal and endangered. The Gourmantch\u00e9 people in Burkina Faso's Tapoa region make a special honey from nectar that bees gather from an array of plants in the arid savannah. Local communities use it in traditional dishes and medicines, but also for celebrations and rituals. Tapoa honey marked a particular milestone for the Ark of Taste, as it was the 5,000th passenger to get on board. Hidden between Norway's fjords, the small village of Undredal is home to 100 people and 500 goats. Together, they hold the secret of Geitost, an artisanal goat's cheese made from fresh raw milk. Cheesemakers add a splash of whole goat's milk and cow's milk cream to fresh whey. Following a boiling process, it is then cooked for 8 to 10 hours. Industrial boats carrying fish from Mauritanian waters to Europe endanger both species and the livelihoods of local people. With a little help from local NGOs and Slow Food, the Imraguen women of Mauritania are trying to preserve traditional knowledge. They buy mullet from fishermen, extract the eggs, rinse and salt them, then let them dry naturally. In Morocco's Souktana plateau, between 1,300 to 1,500 metres above sea level, a group of 11 producers farm small plots of the coveted spice, saffron. Between October and November, farmers and their families gather the saffron flowers at dawn when the petals are still closed. They then remove the crimson stigmas, the most valuable part of the flower. Since French colonialists introduced vanilla to Madagascar, the country has become a leading producer of the spice. In the Mananara Nord Biosphere Reserve, vanilla grows in rainforests just a few meters above sea level. Farmers pollinate the plants by hand every dry morning between September and January and nurture them until the flowers assume the familiar form of black pods. The Lesachtal valley in southern Austria has been home to a wide variety of cereal grains for over 4,000 years. Because rye was best able to stand the cold winters, rye flour became the basis for the typical Lesach valley bread - although the recipe also calls for a small amount of wheat flour. In times gone by, local families would bake a new batch of local bread every two to three weeks. Don tea is not just any tea. This fermented green tea, also known as \"doncha Jangheung\" or \"Cheongtaejeon\" is produced with extreme care in Jangheung, southwestern South Korea. After a long artisanal process and six months of fermentation the tea is ready. But some keep it stored for up to twenty years to improve its flavor.

{"id": null, "body": "     The 10 most expensive weather disasters of 2021 caused more than $170 billion (\u20ac150 billion) in damages, UK charity Christian Aid has reported. That's up $20 billion on last year's figure. The most expensive weather disaster in 2021 was Hurricane Ida, which hit the eastern US in late summer A tally provided by\u00a0humanitarian organization\u00a0Christian Aid put the cost of the 10 most expensive weather disasters of 2021 at $170 billion (\u20ac150 billion). From deadly Hurricane Ida \u00a0in the United States to devastating floods in China and Europe, environmental\u00a0disasters\u00a0like storms, fires and heat waves have cost the world\u00a0$20 billion\u00a0more this year than last, the group said on Monday. The researchers said the increased cost\u00a0is the result of climate change , and added that the 10\u00a0disasters in question also killed at least 1,075 people and displaced 1.3 million others. One of many businesses devastated by the hurricane was the city\u2019s historic Karofsky Shop. According to Governor John Bel Edwards, the focus now is on rescue and recovery efforts. Repairing the damages will take time, he said. Seventy-year-old Theophilus Charles sits in his badly damaged home in Houma, Louisiana. US President Joe Biden has promised Washington\u2019s full and long-term support for those affected by the hurricane. Many homes, like here in Lafitte, experienced extensive flooding after the Category 4 hurricane made landfall. The massive floodwaters also brought destruction further inland, leaving at least two people dead. Many residents left stranded were rescued by helicopter, as seen here in Laplace, Louisiana. In the southwestern corner of Mississippi, entire neighborhoods were cut off from the outside world \u2014 with many roads impassable. Locals have been stocking up on gas and diesel fuel at area gas stations. The evacuations of the past few days have made it almost impossible to obtain fuel, which is needed to run generators and produce electricity. Hundreds of thousands of households are still without electricity in Louisiana, including New Orleans, with a population of 400,000. Many in Louisiana have lost everything. Fran Tribe sits with her dog Dave in front of what used to be her house in Houma before Hurricane Ida hit. It will probably take months to rebuild everything. Jerilyn Collins returned to her devastated home in LaPlace with the help of the Louisiana National Guard to retrieve important medications and personal items for herself and her father. Only a few areas were evacuated before Ida made landfall. Author: Claudia Dehn \"The costs of climate change have been grave this year,\" said Kat Kramer, climate policy lead at Christian Aid and author of \"Counting the cost 2021: A year of climate breakdown.\" \"While it was good to see some progress made at the COP26 summit , it is clear [we are]\u00a0not on track to ensure a safe and prosperous world,\" she said. Many regions in Russia have been burning for weeks, with the area around Yakutia in the far northeast having been hit particularly hard. The authorities have counted more than 250 fires currently burning across Russia, covering a total area of more than 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres). But it's not just the fires that are causing problems for locals. Dense smoke has been drifting across populated areas, for example the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. This is especially hard for the elderly and children, as it's nearly impossible to breathe outside. Evacuees on a ferry at the port of Pefki, Euboea \u2014 they are embarking on a journey into the unknown, as their homes and belongings will probably be destroyed by the time they return. For the first time since the forest fires started on the Greek island of Euboea at the beginning of last week, massive air missions are now being flown to fight the fires. Eyewitnesses report apocalyptic scenes. But not everyone is fleeing \u2014 many local residents want to support the firefighters. At times, that can include desperate acts \u2014 such as with this man, who\u2019s trying to beat out flames with a tree branch. Such autonomous actions are causing a major problem for the authorities, as through them, many people are placing themselves in grave danger. Besides Greece and Italy, Turkey is also struggling with devastating fires. Walls of fire are spreading from the forests to residential areas. On this photo, Turkish firefighters are trying to stop a blaze near Cokertme that threatens to spread into buildings. More than 150,000 hectares \u2014 including entire villages \u2014 have already fallen victim to the flames in Turkey. More than 5,700 fires are currently raging in the West Coast state of California \u2014 and the typical wildfire season there has not even started yet. The Dixie Fire is now the second-largest in the state's history, and completely destroyed the town of Greenville. In this photo, a fire crew member keeps an eye out for spot fires to slow the wildfire near the town of Westwood. In California, whirlwinds of ash and embers, such as this one that meandered through the Santa Barbara hills, are complicating matters. West Coast fires have even been creating their own weather. With the situation more devastating than in previous years, governors of affected states have turned to Washington for help \u2014 they are urgently seeking more emergency staff and firefighting aircraft. Author: Claudia Dehn The most expensive weather disaster of\u00a02021 was Hurricane Ida , which hit the eastern part of the\u00a0United States in the summer, causing some\u00a0$65 billion in damages. After barreling through\u00a0 Louisiana at the end of August, it made its way northward, resulting in\u00a0extensive flooding in New York City and the surrounding area . Heavy rains swept across western Germany in July, leading to unprecedented flooding. The states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia were particularly hard hit, as were the neighboring countries of the Netherlands and Belgium. Small rivers and streams turned into torrential currents that destroyed entire villages . Dams threatened to break while electricity and cellphone networks were shut down in what became one of the region's worst natural catastrophes in living memory. Over 180 people\u00a0died in Germany alone, and many more lost their homes and belongings. The deadly flooding in Western Europe came at a cost of $43 billion, according to Christian Aid's report. A winter storm in Texas that took out the\u00a0state's power grid caused $23 billion in damages, followed by flooding in China's Henan province in July, which\u00a0cost an estimated $17.6 billion. Other disasters costing several billion dollars include flooding in western Canada, a late spring freeze in France that damaged vineyards\u00a0and a cyclone that struck\u00a0India and Bangladesh in May. From punishing heat in North America , to wildfires raging\u00a0across the\u00a0Mediterranean ,\u00a0to record-breaking floods in Europe and Asia,\u00a02021's weather disasters brought home the reality of climate change , according to environmental experts. Local authorities have made urgent calls for emergency aid to be sent to areas affected by Typhoon Rai. The governor of Bohol province pleaded on the radio for the government to send provisions amid growing hunger and fears of looting. Typhoon Rai was packing winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour. Trucks were flung on their sides, trees were uprooted and power lines were damaged. Efforts are underway to restore power and cell reception. Many of the typhoon's victims were killed when structures collapsed and when trees fell. Many were also caught up in flash floods. With many more people still missing, the death toll is likely to continue rising. Typhoon Rai damaged critical infrastructure in many areas. Residents have been battling to get money from banks, and long lines for food and fuel have been reported. The government has not made any appeal for international assistance. Residents in affected areas have been lining up for fresh water and other essentials. There are concerns that if basic needs are not met, people will begin resorting to looting.

{"id": null, "body": "     The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report details a widespread climate catastrophe, along with ways to address \u2014 and fund \u2014 adaptation and resilience in vulnerable regions. Climate-related drought in Somalia has left 70% of people without access to clean drinking water A stark picture of an unfolding climate crisis that is especially impacting vulnerable communities fills the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change. \"The most striking thing about this report is the reality that climate impacts are already unfolding in really ghastly, deadly ways around the world [and] already having profound impacts on food systems. So this is not about some future that's yet to come, it's already here in many places,\" said Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at the Washington, D.C.-based Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Today's IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership,\" said UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. Themed on climate impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, the second installment of the IPCC's sixth assessment report builds on a\u00a0 first edition focused on the physical science of\u00a0climate systems and intensifying climate change. Authored by 270 scientists who assessed over 34,000 studies, the report singles out Africa, Asia, Central and South America, small island nations and the Arctic as areas that are especially being impacted by heatwaves, droughts,\u00a0floods and rising seas \u2014 weather extremes that are also driving biodiversity loss and mass mortalities in species such as trees and corals. In Africa , for example, climate change has caused a 34% reduction in agricultural productivity since 1961, which is more than any other region, according to the report. Future warming is expected to shorten growing seasons and worsen\u00a0 water stress .\u00a0 \"Somalia has been the hardest hit by climate change in the globe,\" said Walter Mawere, the advocacy and communications coordinator for humanitarian NGO Care International in Somalia. He describes over 2,400 camps for the internally displaced in the country that are filling with families fleeing an ongoing drought, and previous extreme flooding. \"The flooding has left 70% of the population without access to clean water,\" he explained during a briefing preceding the report's release. Many countries around the world banned the usual New Year's fireworks to relieve pressure on hospitals swamped with COVID-19 cases. For Germany, that meant an estimated 3,500 tons of plastic waste saved. In Amsterdam, the taboo on home pyrotechnics looks set to endure, with the city organizing public displays instead. Europe and North America saw plunging temperatures, with many regions blanketed in deep snow. Arctic warming caused dips in the polar vortex and a weaker jet stream, conspiring to send chilly Arctic air south. Disruption of the jet stream can also have the reverse effect, sending warm air up from the tropics. We're yet to see which trend will dominate as the planet continues to heat up. Thousands of people had to leave their homes after heavy rain flooded towns in eastern Australia. Gladys Berejiklian, then the premier of New South Wales, a state that was particularly affected, called the inundation a \"one-in-100-year event.\" Some commentators argued that this kind of flooding is in fact becoming the new normal. Europe's biggest economy was given a reality check by its Constitutional Court, which declared the German Climate Protection Act unconstitutional for failing to include climate targets beyond 2030. The court said this would place too great a burden on future generations. The Bundestag toughened up the legislation with a commitment to go climate-neutral by 2045. In another landmark ruling, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered Shell to cut its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was the first time a private company has been legally forced to comply with the global agreement. \"This applies to the entire world, so also to Shell,\" the judge said. More than 230 people died during a heat wave in Canada, with record temperatures of nearly 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) recorded in Lytton, British Columbia. The following day, forest fires reduced much of the village to ash. This was also a summer of devastating blazes for California, Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey, and Siberia and the Amazon. In Central Europe, catastrophic heavy rain turned streams into raging rivers that inundated towns and villages as they burst their banks. In Germany's Rhineland, more than 180 people lost their lives. Parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also suffered extreme floods. Property damage in Germany alone was estimated at several billion euros. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report with an unequivocal message: The climate crisis is worse than we thought and humans are definitely to blame. The IPCC's assessment reports are the most detailed and comprehensive on the topic, in this case drawing on more than 14,000 peer-reviewed studies. At the UN General Assembly, Premier Xi Jinping announced that China would no longer build coal-fired power plants abroad \u2014 putting an end to a construction spree that has already seen hundreds of Chinese-backed coal power projects go up as part of its Belt and Road Initiative through Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. But Beijing continues to build new coal power plants at home. Concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere reached a new record in 2020. According to the report by the World Meteorological Organization, the year-on-year increase was higher than the average increase over the past decade, despite the economic fallout of the pandemic. The WMO announced the figures with the warning that \"we are way off track\" for the Paris Agreement targets. After a pandemic hiatus, the UN Climate Change Conference was back in 2021, but it struggled to decide the details of the Glasgow Climate Pact. With India and China resisting a commitment to phase out coal, the final text agreed only to a \"phasedown.\" For many, this was hugely disappointing, though not necessarily surprising. Greta Thunberg had already declared COP26 \"a global greenwash festival.\" With the year drawing to a close, the US was hit by more extreme weather as 36 tornadoes swept through six states and left devastation in their wake. Homes and businesses were demolished, while dozens of people were killed. President Biden announced an investigation into global heating's impact on the tornadoes. Soonafter, nearly 400 people died in the Philippines after Typhoon Rai hit. Author: Jeannette Cwienk The IPCC report is also \"a dire warning about the consequences of inaction,\" said Hoesung Lee, Chair of the IPCC. \"Our actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to increasing climate risks.\" In response to worsening global climate impacts, the report specifically refers to \"equity and justice\" for impacted communities \u2014 and especially vulnerable communities in less economically countries. \"The recognition of justice is integral to the way we address the climate crisis,\" said Rachel Cleetus. The report therefore looks at socioeconomic and structural factors that cause some populations \"to be disproportionately impacted by climate change,\" she added. After the perceived failure of COP26 to commit funds to address adaptation, and rising\u00a0climate-driven\u00a0loss and damage, the report details the need for greater climate financing . Currently, however, more than 90% of climate funds go to mitigation rather than adaptation \u2014 which is \"way below most estimates of the cost of adaptation needed today\u00a0to manage the risks of climate change over the next ten to 20 years,\" said IPCC report lead author Mark New, who is director of the African Climate and Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town. Meanwhile, only about 10 to 15% of available adaptation finance is made available to climate vulnerable local communities, according to New. The report calls for a balance of climate finance to be invested in adaptation. \"Adaptation and mitigation must be pursued with equal force and urgency,\" said Antonio Guterres . Building on the renewed focus on adaptation at COP26, the IPCC reconfirms the need for richer nations to \"provide higher levels of financial support for adapting to climate shocks \u2026 and addressing the costs of loss and damage experienced by poorer countries,\" said Camilla Toulmin, Senior Fellow, International Institute for Environment & Development. The world's poorest people \"contribute least to the problem of climate change\" yet suffer the most devastating impacts, she added. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the average per capita carbon footprint in 2020 is around 0.1 tons per year compared to up to 15 tons in Australia, Canada and the US. \u00a0 The report also focuses on the importance of reversing the threat to biodiversity as part of adaptation. \"Protecting and restoring nature will help store more of the carbon we emit, and make our landscapes more resilient to the growing extremes that climate change inflicts on every species on our planet,\" said Kate Jones, chair of ecology & biodiversity, University College London. \"This report recognizes the interdependence of climate, biodiversity and people,\"\u00a0said Hoesung Lee.\u00a0\u00a0 Promoting \"healthy ecosystems\" is another important adaptation measure aimed at\u00a0fostering\u00a0climate resilience by ensuring reliable access to food and clean water.\u00a0 \"By restoring degraded ecosystems and effectively and equitably conserving 30 to 50 per cent of Earth's land, freshwater and ocean habitats, society can benefit from nature's capacity to absorb and store carbon,\" said IPCC Working Group II Co-Chair Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner of the ecosystems-based approach. He added, however, that \"adequate finance and political support are essential.\" Looking ahead\u00a0to\u00a0November's\u00a0 COP27 , the first climate conference to be hosted in Africa, Toulmin was encouraged by the fact that the Africa chapter in the report was, for the first time, authored exclusively by regional experts who can provide \"African negotiators with a much stronger case.\" Meanwhile, Russia's invasion of Ukraine inevitably influenced the final review of the IPCC report, with Ukraine's delegation of authors having to withdraw from the process to hide in bunkers. \"There's this connection,\" said Svitlana Krakovska, a climate scientist heading the Ukrainian delegation, of the role of\u00a0oil and gas in simultaneously unfolding war and climate crises. \"All the money for this aggression comes from oil, from fossil fuels. The more we use this, the more we sponsor this aggression,\" she said.\u00a0 Edited by: Tamsin Walker This is the port of Saint-Louis in Senegal. The city was built in the 17th century for its strategic coastal position at the mouth of the Senegal River and was the capital of French West Africa until 1902. But these days, its proximity to the ocean is a threat. The UN has warned that the city is at greater risk from rising sea levels than any other in Africa. Mouhamadou Moussa Gaye, a schoolteacher, looks out over Guet Ndar, a district of Saint-Louis and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Guet Ndar occupies a long peninsula called the Langue de Barbarie that separates the estuary of the Senegal River from the open ocean. The school where Gaye used to teach, as well as mosques and homes on the peninsula, have already been lost to coastal erosion. Being designated a UNESCO World Heritage site doesn't mean much to Mother Nature. Here even the most basic public facilities can fall prey to the ocean's water. The pupils who used to attend the destroyed school have been transferred to three other schools in the city. Yet when lessons are over, they still come to play among the ruins of their old classrooms. In 2003, the authorities dug a channel through the Langue de Barbarie so water could flow out of the estuary and away from Saint-Louis when the Senegal River threatened to flood. But their bid to protect the city backfired. Water flowed both ways, eroding the banks of the channel until it opened into a huge gulf, taking 800 meters of the Guet Ndar beach, as well as neighboring villages, with it. Ahmet Sene Diagne used to live in one such village. Now, as he navigates the water along the coast from Saint-Louis in a \"pirogue\" with his son, he recalls how he went to the town hall to warn against excavating the channel, but officials didn't listen. \"They didn't believe me,\" Diagne says. \"They asked me to show my diplomas, but I don't have any. I live in the bush.\" Now, all that can be seen of Diagne's village is the stump of a tree that once stood in the central square \u2014 the tree that Diagne got married under. His family is of the Lebu ethnic group, who have fished for generations. Now their coastal communities have been destroyed and Diagne says there's no future in fishing. He hopes a good education will give his sons other options. Latyr Fall, deputy mayor of Saint-Louis, stands on the old seawall that once protected his city. \"It dates back to 1930 and was built by the French colonists,\" he says. But he is unequivocal that the threat to Saint-Louis is from climate change \u2014 and the sea level rise since colonial times calls for new measures to protect the coast. \"The wall no longer protects us.\" The Senegalese government is building a new dike that will be 3 kilometers (1.15 miles) long and 20 meters (65 feet) wide to protect Guet Ndar from further coastal destruction. But to accommodate this massive structure, many of the remaining houses on the endangered coastline will have to be demolished to make room for the new construction project. With funding from the World Bank and France, shelters have been built to house those whose homes have already been lost to the rising tide and those displaced to make way for the dike. Some 10 kilometers inland at Diougop, the displaced residents complain the shelters are sweltering during the day and cold at night, and there aren't enough toilets. Ahmet Sene Diagne now lives in a settlement called Jel Mbaam, where he grows and sells his own produce. On the wall of his home, hangs a map showing where his village used to be before it was submerged. He still doesn't trust the authorities to protect the coast. \"They should involve the people from here in their plans because we are the ones who live here, and were born from this water,\" he says.

{"id": null, "body": "     Unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 per cent each year, the world will fail to meet the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, a report from the UN Environment Programme warns. Signing up to the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, world leaders agreed to limit global warming by the end of the century to 1.5 degrees Celsius, ideally, and certainly no higher than 2 degrees C. But\u00a0a United Nations report published today says\u00a0either goal\u00a0is a long way off. Instead of cutting emissions, humans released more CO2\u00a0in 2018\u00a0than ever before, according to the annual Global Emissions Gap Report. Last year,\u00a055.3 gigatons of global CO2 were pumped into the atmosphere,\u00a0up from 53.5 gigatons in 2017. Global temperatures are set to rise about 3.2 degrees C by 2100, the report says, bringing catastrophic weather including hotter, deadlier heatwaves and more frequent floods and drought. Little change from big polluters \"Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions \u2014 over 7 per cent each year, if we break it down evenly over the next decade,\" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). From 2030, 15 gigatons of CO2 would have to be cut each year, she added. This is roughly the annual emissions of the EU, India, Russia and Japan combined. Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions would have to increase five-fold to reach the 1.5 degrees C target \u2014 a projection already made in a previous version of the report. The difference, however, said\u00a0Anne Ohlhoff, a co-author of the 2019 report, is that\u00a0time is slowly running out. Most responsible for the continually increasing emissions is the G20, a group of 20 of the world's biggest economies, who emit the equivalent of 43 gigatons of CO2 \u2014 78% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Fast-growing, developing countries also contribute to high emissions, said John Christensen, director of UNEP DTU Partnership, an international climate research group, but can't be expected to be the first to cut emissions. \"Industrialized countries must take the lead here.\" Despite few concrete results, some things have changed politically in the last few years, said Ohlhoff. \"We know what we need to do.\" Solar power has boomed across the world Many countries have struggled to end their reliance on coal How to close the emissions gap The report names five key areas that will be decisive in the future: 1. At\u00a0least \u20ac1.45 billion ($1.59 billion) annual investment in renewables and more efficient energy use 2. Coal phaseout 3. Decarbonization of transport 4. Decarbonization of\u00a0industry 5. Increased access to electricity for 3.5 billion people The number of countries, regions and cities setting goals to go carbon-neutral has risen since September last year from just a handful to about 65. The European Union, for example, aims to be carbon neutral by 2050. Individual countries including Germany, the UK and France have also set zero-emissions goals. But how exactly they will achieve this \u2014 and how soon \u2014 is uncertain. Only a few of the 65 have laid out a timeline for reaching net-zero, according to the report, none of which are countries in the G20. Fossil fuel production grows globally Eager to cut out carbon, but unwilling to give up fossil fuels, countries are struggling to rein in emissions. Production of coal, gas and crude oil is rising, and reached its highest level in 2018 at around 37 gigatons. Some environmental economists have called for a tax on CO2 emissions to incentivize companies to produce energy more sustainably. But the comprehensive introduction of a CO2 price has so far been unsuccessful. One strategy for closing the emissions gap would see renewable sources make up 85% of the world's electricity mix by 2050. Major turnaround still possible On the one hand it's a matter of having greater ambitions, said Christensen, and on the other hand of implementing them faster. \"Energy and transport will be the most important areas.\" The report states that technologies for rapid and cost-effective emission reduction have improved, such as the price of solar energy, which can compete with coal on cost. \"We can create this change without sacrificing prosperity,\" said Christensen. If the world is to slow down and adapt to global warming, it must acknowledge that\u00a0\"fundamental changes in values, norms, consumer culture and worldviews are inevitable parts of the great sustainability transformation,\" the report concludes. In its IPO prospectus, oil giant Saudi Aramco acknowledged for the first time that oil demand could peak within the next 20 years. But experts suggest mankind will cut its addiction to crude sooner rather than later.

{"id": null, "body": "     German cities and towns are struggling with water shortages. Climate change is making it more difficult for municipalities to reach the groundwater they rely on. Despite the lush, verdant nature that surrounds the German town of Ulrichstein, residents here \u2014 and in the region \u2014 suffer from acute water shortages. Ulrichstein Mayor Edwin Schneider, meanwhile, is deeply concerned by his town's dire water shortage. \"I never thought we would be affected like this,\" he told DW, even though he had heard about similar situations in surrounding regions of the state of Hesse. Other areas \u2014 from the northwestern state of Lower Saxony to municipalities in the country's east \u2014 have also reported water shortages. For the last 100 years, the people of Ulrichstein have sourced their water from six wells that are only two to three meters deep. In recent times, these have almost dried up, delivering a mere four cubic meters of water per hour \u2014 just half of what the town of 3,000 needs. Unlike other parts of the country, where dams are used to divert drinking water to settlements, this option is not available here. The people of Ulrichstein, like 70% of people in German municipalities, must rely on groundwater. Read more: \u00a0 Water shortages pose growing risk to global stability Instead, a drilling company is set in the coming weeks to try to tap into the groundwater below the town. Water that the firm insists is there \u2014 despite criticism from geologists who say groundwater levels below Ulrichstein, the highest permanent settlement in the state at 614 meters (2,014 feet) above sea level, are insufficient for the town's needs. At over 600 meters above sea level, Ulrichstein relies on groundwater for its needs Schneider said the reason for his town's water shortages has to do with its geographical location. Due to the Rhine Weser watershed, he said, \"water just keeps draining away, and winters have become quite mild in these parts.\" This means groundwater is not being replenished during the winter months. The situation is complicated further because the nearby city of Frankfurt also taps into the local groundwater, sourcing one-third of its requirements \u2014 some 40 million cubic meters \u2014 from this region. \"I got quite angry when Frankfurt asked its residents to water the city's trees during one hot summer,\" the mayor admitted. A \u20ac150,000 ($177,000) trial showed no groundwater the Ulrichstein could tap into at a depth of 120 meters. However, the drilling company found water at a depth of 200 meters. The well, which cost some \u20ac800,000 to drill, will only serve as an interim solution as there is not as much water as the officials hoped for, and no one knows how long before it dries up. Schneider said dry winters means groundwater supplies are not being replenished The municipal council is looking into alternatives to source drinking water. For this purpose, it has modernized two of its eight water treatment plants at a cost of \u20ac2 million. Ulrichstein is also considering installing a 4.5-kilometer canal to the next town to source water. This endeavor, however, carries a \u20ac650,000 price tag. Ultimately, the municipality decides to hire a logistics company to make six deliveries of 60,000 liters (15,850 gallons) of water each day by truck. Locals are also urged to use the precious resource sparingly by abstaining from watering their lawns or otherwise using water unnecessarily. A converted milk truck delivered water to Ulrichstein Whatever option the town chooses , residents will be facing higher water bills. Local businessman Klaus Kraft is especially hard-hit by the water shortage. He has been running a laundromat for years. Each day, his business consumes about 12 cubic meters of water, less than half the 30 liters it used to require. But, he said, he cannot hike up prices as this would hurt his business. Currently, sourcing and disposing of one cubic meter of drinking water\u00a0costs about \u20ac10 \u2014 roughly three times what residents in other German cities pay. Kraft said he can't raise prices to cover higher water costs without hurting his business A woman who has lived in the town for many years said she noticed the water shortages three years ago. \"One day, the water pressure just dropped off,\" she said, adding that the town's calls for residents to use water sparingly are being ignored by many. One of the more recent\u00a0and visible\u00a0culprits is private swimming pools appearing in many residents' backyards. According to Germany's Swimming Pool and Wellness Association, a growing number of Germans are deciding to install their own pools. One reason for this is that people who are traveling less during this pandemic want to have a nice time relaxing at home . Karsten Rinke, a biologist with the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, says Germans will have to prepare for future water shortages. At least technological innovations and water conservation efforts have reduced the average daily water consumption in Germany from 147 to 123 liters per person, says the researcher. But Germany's Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK) reports that climate predictions paint a gloomy picture of the future. It warns that people in some parts of Germany could soon face problems sourcing drinking water. It took 200 meters worth of drilling to find groundwater Ulrichstein could use German Environmental Minister Svenja Schulze has scheduled a \"water summit\" for spring 2021 to discuss this worrying situation with federal, state and local representatives. She wants to devise a comprehensive strategy to tackle the country's water shortage.

{"id": null, "body": "     German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on climate change, refugee policy and the coronavirus pandemic in an exclusive DW interview. A clearly relaxed, smiling Angela Merkel sat down in the Berlin Chancellery\u00a0to talk with DW news chief Max Hofmann. As her 16-year tenure draws to a close, the German chancellor mused on her\u00a0two biggest challenges, her disappointments\u00a0and her likely successor, Olaf Scholz. \"I'm not a machine, of course, but...\u00a0a human being,\" Merkel said, when asked about being called a \"compromise machine\" at her last EU leadership conference in October. \"I\u00a0always enter into such talks with an open mind,\" she said of her approach to policymaking\u00a0at international conferences. She also discussed her approach when she was talking to a leader who does not share her set of values: \"However, I\u00a0also want to say that if someone has a fundamentally different perception of the world, then you should listen to them nonetheless; after all, if we didn't listen to each other anymore, we'd no longer find any solutions.\" While the chancellor emphasized things she was proud of, such as maintaining strong ties with allies and beginning\u00a0 Germany's exit from coal , she didn't shy away from discussing things she wish had gone a bit differently. \"We're not doing too badly in Germany compared with other countries,\" she said of the country's environmental record.\u00a0\"But we're also one of the leading industrialized countries,\" she added, noting that with new technologies and scientific insights, it was Germany's responsibility to \"lead by example.\" However, Merkel added, the German political system means a leader has to build consensus before new legislation can be introduced.\u00a0\"We always need majorities for our decisions. This is an issue that I\u00a0discuss with climate activists time and again. They say 'you have to do this now,'\u00a0and I\u00a0say 'but I\u00a0still have to get a majority.' There have been many social expectations; there are many fears. I've always been committed to this, and yet I\u00a0cannot say today that the outcome is satisfactory.\" \"We have to pay heed to the scientific estimates again, and that means sticking to global warming of 1.5\u00a0degrees [Celsius/2.7 degrees Fahrenheit]. [ The COP26 climate conference in]\u00a0Glasgow has already yielded a number of results. But this is still going too slowly from young people's understandable perspective,\" she said. The chancellor also expressed her wish for a different outcome in Afghanistan . \"We are of course very sad about the fact that we simply did not manage to achieve what we wanted to do, namely find a self-sustaining political order in Afghanistan, one in which girls can go to school, women can fulfill their wishes, and with lasting peace,\" said Merkel, looking grave for a moment. \"Often, I've asked in discussions: how come so many young Afghan men want to come here, while at the same time our men and women in uniform are stationed over there? ... Nevertheless, we simply must accept that, despite our best intentions, we did not manage to create the order we would have liked to see there,\" Merkel said.\u00a0\"The blame for this lies not with Germany alone. The Afghans, for their part, did not get it done either. It is simply very regrettable.\" Asked about her biggest struggles as leader, Merkel reflected: \"The two events I personally found most challenging were, for one, the large number of refugees arriving here [in 2015], which I actually do not like to call a 'crisis'\u00a0\u2013 because people are people. So, first, there was the pressure we faced from many people fleeing Syria and its neighboring countries. And now there is the COVID-19 pandemic . Maybe these were the crises where we clearly saw how people are being directly affected, where human lives hang in the balance. For me, those were the biggest challenges.\" The chancellor said the European Union still needs to be\u00a0able to find\u00a0\"a common system for addressing asylum and migration\" and create \"a\u00a0self-regulating balance between the countries of origin and those where refugees first arrive,\" in order to better help refugees and fight the root causes of why people flee. Asked to look back on her famous quote from 2015, when she said \"Wir schaffen das,\" or, \"We can do this,\" she admitted that \"not everything went exactly as it should.\"\u00a0But\u00a0Merkel considered it a major success to see how many refugees Germany had taken in, many of whom now\u00a0permanently live and work in the country. \"Yes, we did it. But by 'we', I mean a truly large number of people in Germany who helped get it done: many mayors, many volunteers,\" and the many who are still supporting their new friends, neighbors, and co-workers, the chancellor said. Merkel sat down with DW's Max Hofmann for one of her final interviews on the job Smiling, Merkel conceded that having her likely successor Olaf Scholz\u00a0 by her side at the recent G20 meeting in Rome \"wasn't quite that generous a step on my part\" \u2014\u00a0as her finance minister, he was always going to attend. However, she did bring Scholz\u00a0to many closed-door discussions as a sign of continuity and harmony. Despite the fact that they come from different political parties \u2014 Scholz is from the center-left Social Democrats \u2014 Merkel appeared to have every confidence in the future chancellor. \"I thought it was an important signal for Olaf Scholz to be part of all bilateral discussions. That way, I could say, seated right here is the man you will probably be speaking with at the next meeting, in the role of German head of government,\" Merkel said. \"I felt that was important.\" She added that she thought it important to leave the impression that \"the current chancellor and the likely future one have a good working relationship.\" \"This sends a reassuring signal in a rather turbulent world. I thought it was the right thing to do. \" Finally, the chancellor was asked about seeing someone else sitting in the chancellery after 16 years. \"You'll get used to it,\" Merkel said, smiling again. Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other political insiders once called her his \"girl.\" Merkel stepped out of his shadow in 2001, when she led the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) in the opposition. But her real moment came in 2005. In the 2005 general election, the CDU, along with its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, eked out a win over the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), led by then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. It was actually the CDU's worst election performance in its history and an inauspicious start for Merkel, but she hit the ground running. The CDU and SPD formed a \"grand coalition\" government and Merkel became the first woman, first former East German and the first scientist to become chancellor \u2014 as well as the youngest person ever to hold the position. Merkel quickly showed prowess. At the G8 summit in 2007, she welcomed the leaders of the eight largest economies to Heiligendamm, on the Baltic Sea. She joked around with then-US President George W. Bush (left) and Russia's Vladimir Putin (right). On the European political stage in the fall of 2008, Merkel had to share the spotlight with the big male egos of French President Nicolas Sarkozy (front) and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The growing financial crisis quickly became the European Union's most pressing concern. The public debt of some European Union member states kept growing, threatening the very existence of the euro as a currency. Merkel's offer to help came with austerity demands. That did not go down well, especially in Greece, where newspapers ran images comparing the moment to Nazi Germany's occupation in World War II. Merkel is not the best orator. Her speeches are often halting and she rarely goes into depth on policy. Yet her quiet pragmatism and sober modesty have won wide appeal. That has helped her run four governments. At some point in her long tenure, Merkel went from chancellor of the country to mother of the nation. She was sometimes referred to by supporters and opponents alike as \"Mutti,\" a rather old-fashioned word for \"mom.\" It can be meant a little sarcastically, but it's often also said with affection, as in this Merkel supporter's poster, a play on words that translates as \"fully Mutti-vated.\" Few of Merkel's statements have had such a lasting impact as the one above. The chancellor won widespread praise in 2015 for staying committed to the EU's open-border policy and allowing more than 1 million migrants and refugees, many escaping the Syrian war, to enter Germany and the bloc. A vocal minority, however, pushed back against open migration. Time magazine named Merkel its \"Person of the Year\" in 2015, and even \"chancellor of the free world.\" She has shown her mettle in the face of multiple crises, whether financial, social or political. Merkel is discreet. She remains silent on her personal thoughts about less agreeable leaders, and deals with them as a matter of state interest. Merkel knows what a liter of milk costs, and years leading the country seem not to have gone to her head. Here in 2014, she visited a Berlin supermarket with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. It's not unusual to spot the chancellor doing the grocery shopping on her own in downtown Berlin. Merkel is known for holding her hands together in a diamond shape. She has said it helps her stand up straight. And it has helped the CDU: The party used the diamond symbol on campaign posters for the 2013 general election. It became synonymous with trust and calm. Merkel is a very private person. The public knows little more than the fact that her husband, Joachim Sauer, is also a scientist. The two have spent many Easters on the Italian island of Ischia. Due to the global travel slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was the obvious exception. The coronavirus pandemic has changed much more in Germany than Merkel's travel habits. The country \u2014 and other nations \u2014 turned to her for answers in the crisis. Her serious, fact-based style has boosted her popularity. Two years ago, Merkel made clear that she would not seek reelection in 2021. When she goes, she'll have served for 16 years \u2014 matching the record of her mentor Helmut Kohl, Germany's longest-serving chancellor.

The court has now obligated\u00a0the legislature to find a balance between freedom for all and burdens faced by some. \"Older people, at least those who are concerned about the well-being of their children and children's children, should rejoice over this ruling,\" Protestant theologian and former chair of the German Ethics Council, Peter Dabrock, told DW. \"The verdict sends\u00a0a very strong signal,\" he added, and quoted\u00a0the philosopher Immanuel Kant: \"The freedom of the individual ends where the freedom of others begins.\" That principle is now getting a cross-generational perspective, he said. \"As a constitutional court ruling, this is as surprising as it is overdue,\" the ethics expert emphasized. \"The challenged provisions do violate the freedoms of the complainants, some of whom are still very young,\" the court said in a statement. \"Virtually every freedom is potentially affected by these future emission reduction obligations because almost all areas of human life are still associated with the emission of greenhouse gases and are thus threatened by drastic restrictions after 2030,\" the statement said. \"Why study, if our future is being destroyed?\" This sign features a sentiment shared by increasing numbers of German students, who have joined young people worldwide in using Friday school strikes to call for action on climate change. The movement was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began her protests alone in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. With the 2015 Paris climate accord, nearly all of the world's countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), by 2100. The hope is that this target will prevent the worst effects of climate disasters. Concerned by the dire predictions from climate scientists, more and more people have called for immediate action. Despite urgent warnings, politicians have dragged their heels on important climate decisions. It's become clear that Germany will miss its targets for 2020. Climate protection was an important factor in the European elections in late May, with the Greens winning more than 20% of the vote in Germany alone, more than double previous results. Among 18-24-year-olds, 34% backed the party. Germany's climate movement is fighting on many fronts. In recent years, activists have fought to preserve Hambach Forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, building treehouses to prevent the old-growth forest from being felled to make way for the mining of lignite, or brown coal. Energy giant RWE has launched legal action, and police have cleared the camp several times. In September 2018, a few days after the camp was removed again, a court ruling suspended the clearing of the forest until late 2020, after a lawsuit by environmental group BUND. RWE has argued that the forest has to be cut in order to ensure the coal necessary for Germany's electricity supply. Around 50,000 activists celebrated the victory. Protests organized by groups such as Ende Gel\u00e4nde have increasingly been making headlines. Thousands of young activists have come out to staged events, blocking railway tracks used to deliver coal to power plants near Cologne and occupying huge coal excavators, as seen here in the open-pit mine in the east German town of Welzow in 2016. In January 2019, after seven months of negotiations, a coal commission set up by the federal government to work out Germany's plans to phase out coal power released its findings. It recommended that Germany should continue coal mining until 2038, at the latest \u2014far too late for the country to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris climate accord. An increasing number of young people in Germany are demanding that the government find a way to meet the 1.5-degree target. The emerging Fridays for Future movement has been getting support from longtime environmentalists, teachers, academics and parents. They have called for all German coal-fired power plants to be shut down by 2030, and for renewable energy initiatives to be vastly expanded. Author: Gero Rueter German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Peter Altmaier responded to the ruling, saying it was both \"big and meaningful.\" He added it was \"epochal\" for climate protection and the rights of young people as well as ensuring planning security for the economy. He added that he was \"pleased\" that the court had implemented what he called the \"most important\" requirement of his 2020 climate initiative that ensures the\u00a0reduction targets up to 2050 are \"broken down into concrete reduction targets for each individual year between 2022 and 2050.\" German Finance Minister\u00a0Olaf Scholz said he and Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, who are both from the Social Democrats, the junior coalition partner in the federal government,\u00a0had \"resolved to very quickly prepare a draft bill to advise the federal government.\" He said the aim is to amend the Climate Protection Act so that it complies with the requirements of the Federal Constitutional Court. He added that he expects the bill to receive the approval of the entire federal government. \"Action really needs to be taken now, and I'm ready to do that,\" Scholz said. He accused\u00a0Altmaier,\u00a0a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's\u00a0Christian Democratic Union,\u00a0of\u00a0\"talking about\u00a0big climate goals but then putting on the breaks instead of taking any real action.\" \"It's an incomprehensibly big day for many people,\" said Luisa Neubauer from Germany's Fridays for Futures , who was part of the group that\u00a0filed the complaint. In a tweet, she added: \"This is huge.\u00a0Climate protection isn't nice-to-have, climate protection is a fundamental right.\" Legal representative Felix Ekardt, said the court ruling had delivered the German government a \"slap in the face,\" while lawyer Remo Klinger called it a milestone. Plaintiff Sophie Backsen said, \"We are super happy and relieved.\" Effective climate protection must be implemented now and not in 10\u00a0years when it is too late, she said. Annalena Baerbock, confirmed by the Green Party as their candidate in the race\u00a0to succeed Merkel as chancellor this year, called the decision \"historic.\" Germany's climate protection act was approved by the government\u00a0in 2019. Under the act, Germany is obliged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. It also sets out yearly upper limits for greenhouse gases across various sectors such as energy, transport, buildings and agriculture. If these individual targets are missed, an obligation to make improvements takes effect. \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "German climate law is partly unconstitutional, top court rules", "article_name": "german-climate-law-is-partly-unconstitutional-top-court-rules", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/german-climate-law-is-partly-unconstitutional-top-court-rules/a-57369917", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 7858, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:29.853899"}

{"id": null, "body": "     Leaders of G20 nations endorsed a landmark deal to establish a global minimum tax rate. They were, however, at odds on issues like coronavirus vaccines and fighting climate change. The G20 accounts for more than 80% of the world's gross domestic product, 60% of its population Heads of the world's leading economies began the G20 summit in Rome on Saturday and endorsed a crucial agreement to establish a 15% global minimum corporate tax for the biggest multinationals. The G20 leaders spoke on the proposal during the opening session of the summit, which was also their first in-person gathering in two years. \"Today, every G20 head of state endorsed a\u00a0historic agreement on new international tax rules, including a global minimum tax that will end the damaging race to the bottom on corporate taxation,\" US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. The reform plan aims to deter big corporations from using complicated accounting to evade taxes by using low-tax havens. The proposal has been backed by nearly 140 countries and is expected to be included in the G20 communique on Sunday. After the formal approval, nations would enact the minimum tax on their own. The summit opened with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, the host of the two-day conference, calling for stepping up the pace in getting vaccines to poor nations. He deemed the global COVID-19 gap \"morally unacceptable.\" Draghi highlighted that only 3% of people in the world's poorest nations are inoculated, in contrast to the 70% in rich nations who have had at least one dose. \"These differences are morally unacceptable and undermine the global recovery,'' Draghi said. Draghi urged his G20 counterparts to\u00a0\"do all we can\" to meet a WHO goal of vaccinating 70% of the global population by mid-2022. Reports said the leaders had\u00a0agreed to commit to that target. In their comments to the group via video link, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin also raised the matter of unequal distribution of vaccines.\u00a0 Putin blamed the gap on \"dishonest competition, protectionism and because some states, especially those of the G20, are not ready for mutual recognition of vaccines and vaccination certificates.\" China's Xi also lobbied for exemptions on vaccine patents. He\u00a0said the World Trade Organization (WTO) should promote the transfer of technology to developing nations. Meanwhile, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it is in the power of G20 countries to thwart the COVID-19 pandemic from raging further and to prevent future pandemics. \"How many more will die, in this and future epidemics? The answer is in your hands?\" Tedros said at a talk about health during the summit in Rome. He called on world leaders to end the vaccination crisis by looking into the shortage of vaccines in poorer countries. \"We understand and support every government's responsibility to protect its own people,\" he said. \"But vaccine equity is not charity; it's in every country's best interests.\" Tedros urged the G20 for a quick supply of the vaccine donations that have been promised and also asked the summit to support jab production in Africa . German Chancellor Angela Merkel said a financing mechanism would be established within the G20 to better prepare for future pandemics.\u00a0 Thousands of people marched in Rome on Saturday, urging the international leaders to act against climate change and ensure fair access to coronavirus vaccines. The march was led by climate activists who were seen playing drums and dancing as they called on global heads to save the planet. Dozens of climate activists blocked a road leading to the venue of the summit in southern Rome's Eur district. Environmental activists participate in a roadblock Photos showed police officers carrying seated protesters off the road. Meanwhile, the first day of the summit also saw the Italian Communist party protest in Rome against Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government. Hundreds gathered at the Piazza di San Giovanni in Laterano earlier in the day. The opening address at the protest said that Draghi's system was not made for workers. The first day of the G20 summit was also the eve of the key COP26 conference slated to be held in Glasgow on Sunday. However, there was no consensus yet on Saturday on a collective pledge on climate change. Italy wants the G20 to collectively advocate the United Nations target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But G20 leaders continue to differ over the other crucial goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050. \"We have a moment now when we can try and take some of the nebulous commitments in Paris, solidify them into hard, fast, commitments to cut emissions, to cut cars and coal and so on,\"\u00a0 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will host the Glasgow conference, said. dvv/sms (AFP,AP, dpa, Reuters) \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "G20 leaders endorse global tax rate deal, wrangle over vaccines, climate change", "article_name": "g20-leaders-endorse-global-tax-rate-deal-wrangle-over-vaccines-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/g20-leaders-endorse-global-tax-rate-deal-wrangle-over-vaccines-climate-change/a-59675804", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 5002, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:30.853678"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Are schools equipping kids with the skills to understand and deal with climate change? Some German students don't think so and are trying to get their curriculum changed. Victoria Bederov tilts her head to one side and considers the question for a moment. What does the 18-year-old Berlin student think about climate education in German schools? \"The climate education is unfortunately horrible,\" she says definitively. Her fellow students at the Private Kant School in Berlin, 19-year-old Alina Runk and 18-year-old Leonie Brockmann, nod furiously in agreement. The three final-year high students say the education system is failing to equip children and teenagers with the skills to address climate change \u2014 something they see as a major threat to their future. \"It's not just a teaching of climate change but our survival basically,\" Bederov says. \"It's not enough for the education system to rely on recycling and saying changing light bulbs is the answer.\" Read more:\u00a0 How hard is a low-carbon lifestyle? A Berlin family tells all It is precisely such suggestions that appear most in\u00a0high-school textbooks \u2014 in Germany and elsewhere \u2014 as ways to help slash CO2 emissions, say the students\u00a0and their biology teacher\u00a0Bruce Phillips. In fact, these measures have a much lower impact on emissions than living car-free or taking fewer flights. \"They (the students) all know about the problems,\" Phillips says. \"But they don't know what they should be doing to have the most impact on reducing their carbon footprint \u2026 We're really setting them up to get an F-grade.\" Now Runk, Brockmann and Bederov are on a mission to update the German curriculum. Three students, Alina Runk, Leonie Brockmann and Victoria Bederov (left to right) and their teacher Bruce Phillips want school textbooks to be updated to give young people better ways to fight climate change Student activism The students started by replicating a study from the journal Environmental Research Letters , which looked at\u00a0scenarios for individuals to cut CO2 emissions and how often they appeared in science textbooks in Canada. The authors found decisions such as living car-free, which saves the equivalent of 2.4 tons of CO2 emissions per year, made up just 4 percent of recommended actions in the 10 Canadian science textbooks they examined. A family in the developed world opting to have one less child \u00a0would save, 58.6 tons of CO2 per year, and was never cited. Low-impact solutions appeared much more frequently. Read more: \u00a0 6 things you can do to avoid climate catastrophe Read more: \u00a0 To fly or not to fly? The environmental cost of air travel\u00a0 The three students and their teacher looked at the same high-impact and low-impact actions in a range of geography, chemistry and biology textbooks aimed at 11 to 18-year-olds in the UK, Germany, France, the United States and Australia and came to the same conclusion. Some of the proposed solutions hadn't been updated over the last 25 years, Phillips says. Bederov and the others know suggestions such as having\u00a0fewer children are controversial. But they want to push education departments to include these ideas on their curricula so students are aware of the options and discuss them critically. \"It should really be included in our\u00a0education,\"\u00a0Brockmann says. \"Not in a radical way, in terms of saying 'you shouldn't have any children later,' but just telling students that I have to make conscious decisions in their future.\" They're now contacting textbook publishers and politicians about changing the school curriculum in Berlin \u2014 and then across Germany \u2014 to include more high-impact solutions to climate change. 'A slow-moving creature' Changing the curriculum in any country is a tall order. How much\u00a0climate and environment education a student gets depends on how much of a priority it is at their school, or for a specific teacher, or according to\u00a0the state or local authority in charge of their education system. Read more:\u00a0 Imagine America's next generation are climate deniers Germany's education system, for instance, is highly decentralized, with\u00a0each of the 16 federal states setting its own curriculum. \"In Germany it's each Bundesland (federal state) for itself,\" says Jonas Andreasen Lysgaard, associate professor at the Danish School of Education. \"So the change in curriculum is very slow. The curriculum is traditionally a very slow-moving creature, which becomes even more obvious with an issue like climate change. It's not just a problem in Germany, says Lysgaard. In Denmark, where the bulk of his research is focused, municipal authorities are responsible for schools. If the local authority has a \"heavy focus\" on climate change, a school will find it easier to integrate this into the classroom. \"Otherwise, it might just be one week a year where they focus on climate change. On a policy level, on a governmental level we are lagging severely behind.\" Another challenge is\u00a0equipping already overwhelmed teachers with the skills to adequately teach climate change in a \"crowded curriculum\" that critics say already burdens students and teachers with too many subjects. New ways of teaching Brockmann, Runk and Bederov say high school students have a responsibility to raise awareness of climate change But Lysgaard and a number of educational researchers say climate change cuts across different subjects. A move away from dealing with it as a science subject and toward a humanities approach would help students to understand the complex nature of the problem and how it impacts society. \"They're the climate generation,\" said Angus MacKay, the head of the UN climate change learning partnership\u00a0UN CC Learn. \"They're the ones who need more help, and what I call an intuitive understanding of climate change.\" McKay hopes such an understanding will help the next generation develop effective solutions to tackle\u00a0climate change. MacKay and UN CC Learn are working on a pilot project in the UK with private educational resources company Harwood Education to introduce climate change teaching into subjects from literature and math in 80 schools this year. \"Teachers in the UK are very stressed, so this gives them pre-created lessons,\" says Melanie Harwood, co-founder of Harwood Education.\u00a0The lessons are delivered to children via tablet computers. If the pilot is successful, Harwood hopes the scheme will be introduced to other schools. Some German schools have also taken the initiative by pushing an all-encompassing environmental ethos. At the Hagenbeck high school in the north-east of the German capital, students learn about biodiversity and sustainable living, as well as how to garden. Tasks such as measuring garden beds are a part of math lessons. While they're waiting for the curriculum across the rest of the city to catch up, Runk, Brockmann and Bederov urge\u00a0their peers to take action and call on their teachers and schools to\u00a0find ways to include climate change in lesson plans. The trio gave\u00a0talks at the\u00a0 United Nations climate conference in December 2018 \u00a0to spread to their message, are campaigning on social media, and have\u00a0been\u00a0taking part in world-wide school climate strikes , ditching lessons to call on leaders to do more to fight climate change. \"As students, we have such a big impact on our community,\"\u00a0Bederov says. \"It is very important if you know the information to pass it on, because we're all in this together.\" You just bought a fancy lamp? Make it cooler with efficient lightbulbs. This is one of the small actions that make a difference in the long-term - and let's be honest, it's not a big effort. Some LED bulbs consume up to 90 percent less than traditional ones. In cold or rainy countries, the task might be challenging - but these challenges are nothing compared to the worst consequences of climate change. Recycling has become normal behavior for thousands of people around the world. It definitely contributes to making a better world - but unfortunately, it is not enough. Worried about your clothes shrinking in hot water? Here another reason to keep washing with cold water: Since it avoids turning on the water heater, cold-water washing also produces less greenhouse gas emissions. Until you are ready to get rid of your car completely, you could move to a hybrid electric car. But beware: The electricity that powers it is probably still coming from dirty fossil fuels. Beef production is the largest driver of tropical deforestation worldwide, with soy production closely following - mainly to feed animals. The carbon footprint of a meat-based diet is almost double that of a vegetarian one. Even reducing the amount of meat you eat makes a difference. Renewable energies are the new trend - but we are still largely dependent on fossil fuels such as coal. In countries like Germany, you can choose your energy provider - among some that draw from renewable sources. Air travel is a major challenge when it comes to tackling climate change. Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study.

Gadd set out to explore beneath the Greenland ice cap by undertaking a dangerous climb down moulins \u2014 vertical ice shafts which carry surface water towards the bedrock of glaciers. Although the Greenland ice sheet is the second biggest in the world, it is also the most understudied, meaning Gadd's trip was particularly useful for researchers.

Pugh doesn't miss a chance to draw world leaders into his spotlight either. While swimming the length of the River Thames in 2006 to draw attention to the drought in England, Pugh hopped out of the water when he reached London and paid a visit to then-Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street to urge him to take action on climate change. The government introduced the Climate Change Act shortly after. It's no wonder he helped\u00a0coin the term \"speedo diplomacy.\" Gretchen Bleiler \u2014 snowboarder Since retiring in 2014, this snowboarding icon and former Olympian has spent much of her time raising environmental awareness through lobbying. Bleiler is a member of the Protect Our Winters Riders Alliance , which encourages winter sports athletes to become\u00a0climate activists. She has done everything from protesting on Capitol Hill in Washington DC to speaking at major international events such as the United Nation Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP21). Bleiler also kick-started the \"21 Day Reusable Challenge,\" which encourages participants to avoid plastic water bottles, shopping bags and styrofoam for three weeks. Lauri Markkanen \u2014 basketball player This rising basketball star has pledged to stop eating red meat in order to minimize his carbon footprint. Markkanen is part of the #DontChoke campaign with\u00a0energy company Neste from his native Finland, which encourages others to follow his example and pledge to take concrete steps to protect the environment. The NBA athlete frequently uses social media to keep his fans updated on his mission to live an eco-friendly life, which also includes driving an electric car, recycling and minimizing his use of electricity.\u00a0 Sally Fitzgibbons \u2014 surfer Like all professional surfers, Sally Fitzgibbons spends more time in the water than most. This\u00a0also means she has seen the direct effects of pollution in our oceans. Alongside surfing, the Australian spends much of her time raising environmental awareness, using her platform to inspire the next generation to protect and preserve our waterways. Andrew Ference \u2014 ice-hockey player After retiring from North America's professional ice hockey league NHL\u00a0after 19 years, Andrew Ference turned his attention to another longtime passion: Environmentalism. He teamed up with fellow Canadian and environmentalist, David Suzuki, to create the NHL Players' Association Carbon Neutral Challenge , which encourages players to offset carbon emissions generated by their frequent travel and other negative environmental impacts caused\u00a0by\u00a0professional sports by purchasing carbon credits. These credits are then used to fund alternative energy initiatives such as solar, wind and biofuel. Thanks to Ference, the NHL is now one of the leaders in environmental conservation in the sporting world, with many arenas now using solar panels and LED lights to cut their carbon footprint. Kevin Anderson \u2014 tennis player From plastic wrappers on fresh rackets to fans sipping their cool beverages\u00a0through plastic straws in the stands: it's no secret that plastic is ubiquitous in the world of tennis. World No. 5 Kevin Anderson thinks players need to do more to promote sustainability in the sport. He has been using his influence as an athlete to push for a reduction in the use of plastic \u2014 in particular single-use plastics like net covers \u2014 and encouraging greater adoption of reusable water bottles. Off-court, Anderson also supports the Ocean Conservancy's Trash Free Sea Alliance. \u00a0 As the EU waves through the single-use plastics ban, broadly shuns fracking and pushes for decarbonization by 2050, plans for a wholesale contradiction involving INEOS and US ethane are underway in the city of Antwerp.

{"id": null, "body": "     As new pipelines expand the flow of dirty fossil fuels globally, environmental activists are joining with social justice and indigenous rights movements to cut off climate change-inducing oil and gas at the source. When climate activists took over the office of long-time United States Democratic congresswoman (also former and likely future Speaker of the House) Nancy Pelosi on November 12, they were joined by the youngest member of the newly elected Congress. \"I am proud of each and every single one of you for putting yourselves and your bodies and everything on the line to make sure we save our planet, our generation and our future,\" said New York representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Just two years earlier, Ocasio-Cortez was\u00a0a 27-year-old bartender who joined the protest at the Standing Rock Sioux tribe camp to\u00a0 stop the Dakota Access Pipeline . She came away inspired to help bring change via election to the US Congress. \"My journey here started at Standing Rock, and it started with everyday people doing what you all are doing,\" she told the protesters last week, before explaining the Democrats'\u00a0New Green Deal that would promote jobs while protecting the environment. Ocasio-Cortez isn't the only one to be politicized over a fossil fuel pipeline.\u00a0 Galvanizing a movement The #NoDAPL anti-pipeline movement at Standing Rock focused global resistance to change-inducing fossil fuels on the oil industry's attempts to expand their flow.\u00a0 From gas pipelines between Asia and\u00a0Europe, to the web of infrastructure transporting high-carbon Alberta tar sands oil across North America, to pipes crisscrossing the Niger\u00a0Delta and\u00a0traversing the southern highlands of Mexico, local communities,\u00a0environmentalists, social justice activists and indigenous rights movements \u2014 and sometimes armed militants \u2014 have been fiercely resisting pipelines. \"There's no question that the Dakota Access Pipeline has galvanized this movement,\" Charlie Kronick, a UK Greenpeace\u00a0campaigner and oil industry analyst, told DW.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"The combination of the trampling of the human rights of indigenous and local communities, the underplaying and ignoring of the local environmental impacts, combined with the fact that [for example] the tar sands\u00a0are not compatible with a future that deals with climate change in any meaningful way,\" has created a \"perfect storm,\" Kronick said. The Standing Rock Sioux protests galvanized a movement Though US President Donald Trump thwarted the Standing Rock protesters'\u00a0attempt to stop the fracking gas pipeline, pipeline protesters have also seen a number of victories. Construction of the controversial Keystone XL and Trans Mountain pipelines, which\u00a0ship\u00a0crude bitumen across the US and the planet, have both been halted by federal court cases since August. Read more :\u00a0 Protests threaten to halt controversial Canadian oil pipeline In the former case, decided on November 8, the\u00a0judge said there had been a\u00a0failure to take a \"hard look\" at the impact of the Keystone XL\u00a0on global climate change, after Trump overturned his predecessor's decision to stop construction.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  'Not here, not anywhere' Europeans are also resisting gas pipelines to funnel\u00a0Russian and Central Asian fossil fuels to the continent. The Nord Stream gas pipeline planned to run through the Baltic Sea has\u00a0come under fire over\u00a0its implications for local communities, the\u00a0climate\u00a0 \u00a0and marine life . And in Italy, the so-called #NoTAP movement has emerged to stop\u00a0planned construction of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline, the last stage of the Southern Gas Corridor reaching from Azerbaijan to Italy and part of the European Union's strategy to reduce reliance on Russian gas. NoTAP's slogan is simple: \"Not here, not anywhere.\" Local activists in Puglia, through which the pipeline will arrive after crossing the Adriatic, fear their fish stocks and idyllic coastline will be vulnerable to spills.\u00a0The pipeline also threatens 1,600 ancient\u00a0olive trees which stand in its path. Allegations of\u00a0mafia involvement, money laundering and corruption leading back to the Azerbaijani regime\u00a0are also feeding the resistance \u2014 NoTAP signs abound in Puglia. In March 2017, riot police clashed with protesters attempting to block the cutting\u00a0of centuries-old olive trees for the pipeline. Some locals later\u00a0received fines of up to \u20ac10,000 ($11,500) for protesting; others were banned from the area for three years. As at Standing Rock, where\u00a0protesters had been pepper-sprayed and reportedly attacked\u00a0by police dogs, the view that state police are acting as the security arm of private corporations has further\u00a0fired up protesters.\u00a0 \"You have a lot of human rights violations, and practices of criminalizing dissent,\" Anna Di Ronco of the Department of Sociology at the University of Essex, co-author of a 2018 article on the #NoTAP protests and their use of social media, told DW. The NoTAP protests, involving many olive oil producers who are among the poorest people in the country\u00a0and perceive no economic benefit from the pipeline, began as more of a social justice\u00a0than environment movement, Di Ronco said.\u00a0\u00a0 But in the wake of #NoDAPL, the anti-TAP movement\u00a0also began to cite environmental arguments about climate change, tapping into a broader movement.  Growing civil disobedience When pipelines do go in, protesters are increasingly resorting to sabotage. In October, 2016 nine climate activists, the so-called \"valve turners,\" stalled the flow of tar sands oil from Canada to the US by accessing emergency valves in four states \u2014 and stopping 2.8 million barrels of oil from flowing, roughly 15 percent of daily US consumption. They were quickly arrested.\u00a0\"I'm just more afraid of climate change than I am of prison,\" one activist said. In a stunning victory, the charges against them were dismissed in October. The symbolism of pipelines as the front line of the struggle against fossil fuels is a relatively recent phenomenon in the global North. But for\u00a0Nigeria, the scene of arguably the world's most militant anti-pipeline activism, the war has been ongoing for decades. In 1995,\u00a0renowned\u00a0writer and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged by the Nigerian government for his involvement in non-violent resistance to environmental damage and human rights abuses connected to oil extraction in\u00a0his native Ogoniland.\u00a0 The armed\u00a0Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)\u00a0are said to have started sabotaging and destroying crude oil pipeline run by the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron in the mid-2000s. Their action intensified after Royal Dutch Shell's 55-year-old pipeline spilled millions of liters of crude oil into the Niger River Delta in 2008 and 2009. MEND's militancy has been\u00a0carried on by the Niger Delta Avengers , who have dynamited oil facilities and apparently cut flow by up to 50 percent.  Youth movement For Ocean Hyland,\u200a a 22 year-old Tsleil-Waututh Nation activist and artist from Canada's British Columbia province,\u00a0the battle against the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion is the latest front in a generations-long struggle against the abuse of her people's\u00a0land. But now, climate change has given that fight global resonance. Read more :\u00a0 Indigenous women show the way for banks to divest from fossil fuels \"Industrialization poisoned our home, and we spent 40 years repairing that damage,\" Hyland said at a\u00a0 protest against Barclays bank's funding of the pipeline. Only two years ago,\u00a0her people were\u00a0able to safely eat clams harvested from the inlet again, she continued.\u00a0\"A tar sands pipeline will increase oil tanker traffic in the inlet seven-fold, and put our inlet and all of our work at risk.\" From publishing an op-ed in Teen Vogue \u00a0in\u00a0March, to travelling\u00a0to London in July for the protest against Barclays, Hyland is symbolic of the young people driving the anti-pipeline movement globally. Advocating for divestment from fossil fuel companies, the\u00a0#ProtectTheInlet movement is demanding a transition to green energy and alternatives to pipelines \u2014 including solar projects in the middle of the tar sands. Ocean Hyland was in London to bring forward her message about Barclays pipelines' threat to communities The fossil fuel industry is justifiably\u00a0concerned about all the anti-pipeline activism. \"Anti-energy groups are increasingly targeting pipeline projects, spreading misinformation about purported environmental hazards to incite citizens and elected officials, and using social media to quickly get the public on board with their agendas,\" Jim Sisco, president and founder of energy advisers\u00a0ENODO Global, told\u00a0oil and gas industry publication\u00a0 Rigzone . The industry \u2014 and the politicians that back these projects \u2014 argue that they bring economic benefits. But\u00a0protesters\u00a0in the communities they run through feel a very long way from the profits reaped from fossil fuel trading and power generation.\u00a0 Rising star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is determined to use her\u00a0political office to stop a hazard that her generation believes is very real. \"At Standing Rock, we experienced first-hand people coming together in their communities and trying to use the levers of representative democracy to try and say, 'We don't want this in our community, we don't want this in our backyard,'\" she told the protesters at the sit-in on November 12.\u00a0 And whether\u00a0the fossil fuel industry likes it or not, the fight may have only just begun. A protester's hands covered in crude oil during a 2011 protest against Royal Dutch Shell after pipeline spills in Nigeria, in 2008 and 2009. Shell allegedly ignored advice to replace the outdated Trans Niger Pipeline, which ruptured and inundated villages in Ogoniland with thousands of barrels of oil. Anti-pipeline movements have been around for decades, and are joining up across the globe. Militants from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) patrol the oil-rich creeks of the Niger Delta of Nigeria in September 2008. MEND militants were alleged to have sabotaged and destroyed crude oil pipelines run by the likes of Shell and Chevron, which they say bring little benefit to local communities and cause massive local environmental destruction. Police stand guard at the entrance of Peru's national oil company in Lima, August 2016, where activists placed a coffin filled with items painted in black to represent a contaminated environment. The state oil company Petroperu has admitted to numerous spills in the old and extensive pipeline system that transports oil from the Amazon to the Pacific coast. TransCanada's Tamazunchale Pipeline met with resistance in Mexico during its construction through the country's mountainous and fertile southern region. Several Mexican indigenous communities have joined forces to fight the pipeline. The wall painting here reads: \"No to the gas pipeline, we're an indigenous community and demand respect.\" Opponents of the Dakota Access oil pipeline march out of their main camp in North Dakota in February 2017. The anti-pipeline resistance movement that gathered on Standing Rock Sioux tribal lands became a social media phenomenon under the #NoDAPL hashtag, galvanizing global resistance against attempts to expand the flow of climate change-inducing fossil fuels. A Native American woman recovers after being pepper-sprayed by police after she and other protesters sought to build a new camp to block construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in late 2016. While the #NoDAPL movement did not succeed in preventing the pipeline from being built, it focused attention on the topic and drew together social justice and environmental movements. More than 10,000 people march in British Columbia in March 2018 to protest Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline, which is to transport tar sands oil to the west coast of Canada and on to Asian markets. After months of protests led by First Nations and environmental activists, the pipeline company halted construction in April. Lakota spiritual leader Chief Arvol Looking Horse demonstrates outside the White House in 2015 against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. US Republicans authorized the pipeline \u2014 but in November 2018, a court again blocked its construction. In March 2017, after Italy's State Council permitted construction of Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), demonstrators in Puglia southern Italy clashed with police to protest removal of 1,600 centuries-old olive trees. Several were injured. A 350.org petition claims TAP will \"destroy Europe's climate targets\" and has \"destructive, unjust impacts on the communities in its path.\" The TAPI (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) gas pipeline project was launched in Herat in western Afghanistan in February 2018, and will carry gas from Turkmenistan to the subcontinent.

{"id": null, "body": "     The world needs to drastically cut its carbon emissions by 2050 to head off the worst effects of climate change. A new report highlights how cities could make a huge difference with local green initiatives. As cities pledge to plant more trees , ban diesel vehicles and make the switch to renewable energy , it's becoming increasingly clear that urban areas \u2014 home to more than half of world's 7.5 billion people \u2014 will be central in efforts to tackle the climate crisis. That's the message of a new report released by the Coalition for Urban Transitions (CUT) on Thursday. In the climate fight, \"the battle for our planet will be won or lost in cities,\" it says. With urban areas responsible for around three-quarters of the world's total carbon emissions, it says a major shift in how cities handle their CO2 \u2014 or don't \u2014 could significantly influence global efforts to reach net-zero carbon emissions \u00a0by 2050 and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.

Those cuts would deliver more than half of the world's needed carbon reductions, and at the same time create \"places where people are healthier and more productive.\" Here's a look at some of the recommendations about what cities could do: Over three decades, Medellin went from the \"world's deadliest city\" to a zone of innovative public transport solutions Where this is already happening The CUT report gives numerous examples of cities and regions that have already been transformed by focusing on low-carbon, participatory development and efforts to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality. Nearly 30 years after ranking as the \"world's deadliest city,\" Medellin \u2014 the former poverty-stricken center of Colombia's drug trade \u2014 now boasts higher living standards thanks to solid municipal development plans for neglected neighborhoods and public transport upgrades. Cable cars that connect poorer areas of the city have ushered in an era of innovative public transport solutions for a network that now accommodates 256 million passengers a year.

The dramatic makeover was thanks to ambitious waste management projects funded by public and private partners and legislation changes at the national level. And in Germany, the transition to renewable energy over the last two decades \u2014 from 6% of electricity production in 2000 to 38% in 2018, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new jobs \u2014 has been achieved through a combination of national policies, partnerships between federal and city governments and citizen-owned energy initiatives. France hit record temperatures this summer, and the urban heat island effect means cities are particularly hot. While vegetation releases water into the atmosphere, cooling things down, concrete and asphalt trap heat. During a heat wave, Paris can be 10 degrees hotter than the surrounding countryside. Pollution also builds up in slow-moving summer air \u2014 another reason urban heat waves can kill. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina tore apart one of America's most iconic cultural heartlands.

In Chennai, things have become desperate: its main reservoir has dried up, residents are queuing for hours at pumps, water is being trucked in and hospitals are under pressure. As the planet heats up, more and more cities could run out of water. Arctic temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. This is taking its toll on cities in Russia's far north, as the permafrost beneath building foundations begins to melt.

Rising seas threaten coastal cities the world over, but Jakarta, with 13 rivers, suffers more floods than most. Limited access to water means residents pump it from underground aquifers, causing subsidence. By 2050, 95% of North Jakarta could be submerged.

Author: Ruby Russell Time is of the essence But cities can't afford to waste any time enacting these changes, with the CUT report warning of a \"short window of opportunity.\" Any urban plans launched today \u2014 infrastructure, transport, energy supplies, buildings \u2014 will likely still be in place decades from now. \"The policies and investments made in the next two decades will determine the quality of life on this planet for generations to come,\" said British economist Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, in the report. Speaking to the press, Christiana Figueres, a former UN climate official and current vice chair of the Global Covenant of Mayors , a coalition of more than 10,000 city leaders addressing climate change, stressed the importance of national support for these plans.\u00a0 \"Cities cannot do this alone,\" she said. \"All of these mayors have pledged and are working toward decarbonizing their urban areas, but there is a very clear limit as to what they can do without a coherent policy with national governments.\" The report's authors noted that even if support for climate policies falls short at the national level, commitment at the local level can still make a big difference. \"Cities aren't waiting for anybody to take action,\" said Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles, pointing out that cities can enact many necessary measures on their own. In the US, \"where the Trump administration is actively pulling us backward in the fight against climate change, mayors and cities are still doing the work that serves our residents and our futures.\" Other challenges Commenting ahead of the report's publication, Felix Creutzig of TU Berlin's Institute of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning also pointed to the difficulty of convincing fast-growing urban centers in developing countries like China, India and much of Africa that they should give up the easy, fossil-fueled path to development enjoyed by wealthier nations in North America and Europe. \"Importantly, the 'American way of life' still serves as a role model in many countries,\" Creutzig told DW in an email. \"There is a need to build visuals and imagery\u00a0that depict a status-rich low-carbon way of life that is inclusive and just.\" Read more: \u00a0 Greta Thunberg: The teenage eco-activist who took the world by storm Looking ahead to UN climate smmit\u00a0 One of the main issues up for discussion at next week's UN Climate Action Summit \u00a0in New York will be how the world can bring about a \"full transformation of economies in line with sustainable development goals.\" In its report, CUT says cities are in a prime position to contribute to this shift. \"[The UN summit] is the time for national governments to demonstrate leadership and seize the urban opportunity,\" says the report. With countries boosting their efforts to reduce emissions ahead of the COP26 climate change conference in late 2020, \"it is vital that cities are at the heart of their low carbon economic and development priorities.\" CUT warns that the next 15 months will be \"critical in tackling the climate crisis,\" with world leaders aiming to intensify their 2020 climate goals in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% over the next decade.

{"id": null, "body": "     The Romans built Hadrian's Wall to keep out barbarian raiders from the north 1,900 years ago. Today, global warming is putting the site in northern England and valuable artifacts at risk. Over a length of 118 kilometers (73 miles), Hadrian's Wall crosses northern England from east to west. It was one of the biggest structures built by the Romans and continues to be immensely popular among tourists today. These lucky walkers were even able to witness a double rainbow. The wall was named after Roman Emperor Hadrian. Construction began in 122 AD and ended six years later. It was supposed to prevent raids by barbarians from Caledonia, which had not yet been invaded. Over the years, original items of clothing, tools, weapons and other everyday objects have been found in the area around Hadrian's Wall, much of which consists of marshes and peat bogs. The moist ground is drying out because of global warming caused by climate change, putting the artifacts at risk. Many artifacts, such as this bronze vessel, have retained a fascinating amount of detail because of the peaty soil. However, global warming is causing serious problems. \"When [\u2026] oxygen gets in there, things that are really delicate, that are made of leather, textile, items of wood, crack, decay and are lost forever,\" archaeologist Andrew Birley told news agency, AFP. There is a race between archeologists and climate change as the latter threatens to damage structures that have not yet been explored and understood sufficiently by historians. \"Less than 1% of Hadrian's Wall has been explored archaeologically and a lot of that landscape is protected in this wet peat land environment and that's a landscape that's really under threat,\" said Andrew Birley. During the Roman Empire, thousands of soldiers lived at this site, many of them with their families, a long way from the capital. They left behind numerous relics of their everyday lives, allowing archaeologists today to reconstruct life in the north of the empire. According to Andrew Birley, the artifacts are \"fantastic because they've completely changed our perception of the Roman Empire, the Roman army, they've changed it from being a male preserve to lots of women and children running around.\" Maybe they also ran around Sycamore Gap, a dip on the wall in Northumberland National Park. History you can touch: Hadrian's Wall, which has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987, is one of the most popular attractions in Britain. Tourists particularly like the re-enactments of battles between the Roman conquerors and local populations. A tourist explores the fort of Vindolanda, a Roman settlement not far from the the city of Newcastle upon Tyne, which was named Pons Aelius by the Romans. Only a quarter of the site, which was hidden under a field until 50 years ago, has been excavated. The fort is one of 14 dotted along the wall. Will it be possible to walk along the wall like this man in future? Andrew Birley thinks that the anniversary marking the beginning of its construction offers a good opportunity to think about how the site can be preserved, so that the wall and the precious artifacts are still around in 1,900 years. Over a length of 118 kilometers (73 miles), Hadrian's Wall crosses northern England from east to west. It was one of the biggest structures built by the Romans and continues to be immensely popular among tourists today. These lucky walkers were even able to witness a double rainbow. The wall was named after Roman Emperor Hadrian. Construction began in 122 AD and ended six years later. It was supposed to prevent raids by barbarians from Caledonia, which had not yet been invaded. Over the years, original items of clothing, tools, weapons and other everyday objects have been found in the area around Hadrian's Wall, much of which consists of marshes and peat bogs. The moist ground is drying out because of global warming caused by climate change, putting the artifacts at risk. Many artifacts, such as this bronze vessel, have retained a fascinating amount of detail because of the peaty soil. However, global warming is causing serious problems. \"When [\u2026] oxygen gets in there, things that are really delicate, that are made of leather, textile, items of wood, crack, decay and are lost forever,\" archaeologist Andrew Birley told news agency, AFP. There is a race between archeologists and climate change as the latter threatens to damage structures that have not yet been explored and understood sufficiently by historians. \"Less than 1% of Hadrian's Wall has been explored archaeologically and a lot of that landscape is protected in this wet peat land environment and that's a landscape that's really under threat,\" said Andrew Birley. During the Roman Empire, thousands of soldiers lived at this site, many of them with their families, a long way from the capital. They left behind numerous relics of their everyday lives, allowing archaeologists today to reconstruct life in the north of the empire. According to Andrew Birley, the artifacts are \"fantastic because they've completely changed our perception of the Roman Empire, the Roman army, they've changed it from being a male preserve to lots of women and children running around.\" Maybe they also ran around Sycamore Gap, a dip on the wall in Northumberland National Park.

{"id": null, "body": "     Across the Alps, glaciers have lost half their volume since 1900. And there is no letting up: Melting has accelerated since 1980. Most Alpine glaciers will be gone by the end of this century, scientists say. \"It's almost time to say farewell to our glaciers,\" Austrian mountain farmer Siggi Ellmauer said, looking at the craggy summits across the Pyhrn valley. After a tour of the nature camp he's building for school kids, Ellmauer talks about how climate change is reshaping his world. \"As a child, I never would have thought they could vanish. Even 20 years ago there were still patches of ice up there on those north-facing slopes. I've watched, we've all watched the glaciers shrink here and across the country,\" he said. \"When will they all be completely gone?\" Ellmauer laments the decline of Austrian glaciers Most glaciers in Austria and across the Alps are going to disappear by 2100, scientists say. There is already enough heat-trapping pollution in the air to melt nearly all the ice, even if greenhouse gas emissions are cut to zero immediately, said climate physicist Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, who works as a scientific advisor for the NGO Climate Analytics. Some future climate impacts could be mitigated by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) - but not the demise of alpine glaciers, he added. A few shards of ice will linger in high shady crags, but the powerful rivers of ice that carved the valleys as recently as 150 years ago will be gone. The climate will probably be too warm for new glaciers to form for centuries to come, Schleussner added. No slowdown Extreme melting continued last year, said Andrea Fischer, who heads the team of scientists and volunteers at \u00d6sterreichischer Alpenverein, an alpine organization in Austria that compiles annual reports about glaciers. The latest findings were released this April. Between October 2015 and September 2016, Austria's glaciers receded by an average 14.2 meters (46.6 feet), with a record retreat of 65 meters (213 feet) measured at the Hornkees Glacier in the Zillertal Alps of western Austria. Fischer said 87 of the 90 monitored glaciers retreated, 10 of them by more than 30 meters (100 feet). However, glacier Landeck Kees grew by 1 meter - it's believed that was due to a combination of topography. If the glacier melts back to a place where the terrain is slightly steeper, it may bolt downhill a bit faster. As more meltwater lubricates the base, this accelerates the glaciers' movement. The Alpenverein's glacier records go back to 1870 - and the new figures confirm melting intensified sharply in the 21st century, just as global temperatures soar\u00a0to new record highs nearly every year. Glacier ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth, holding more water than all lakes, rivers, soils and plants combined. Reduced flows or seasonal changes in volume resulting from dwindling glaciers could be more noticeable in the smaller streams in the highest valleys. There, it's likely be have impact on river life, including bugs and fish, as well as riverside habitat like shrubs and trees that are, in turn, important for birds. Scientists are studying those effects, but haven't reached definitive conclusions yet. The lower end of glacier Pasterze has been shrinking in size - the glacier is falling apart Excessive melting and thinning Extensive melting was documented in the latest report, despite relatively good conditions: Spring snow formed a reflective layer, and the snow-free season was shorter compared to previous seasons, which helped prevent even worse melting, according to Fischer. In the previous year, three glaciers had retreated by more than 90 meters. Neureiter says the decline is plain to see Austria's glaciers are not only losing in length - that is, how far they extend down the valley - they are also becoming thinner, said Anton Neureiter, a glaciologist with Austria's central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) who monitors ice mass on 12 glaciers both north and south of the main crest of the Alps. Standing near the snout of Austria's largest glacier Pasterze, Neureiter prepares to drill into the ice until he hits the rock below. He's checking the same spot every year to find out how much the ice sheet has thinned. Neureiter says the most striking thing is actually that he doesn't even need his equipment to observe the glacial meltdown. Dying glaciers \"It's so tangible. You can see the changes from year to year, even month to month, every time you visit the glacier,\" he said before drilling into the ice. \"This glacier is dying. It's falling apart,\" he added, pointing to the dirty gray and brown piles of rotten ice at the edge. The Pasterze is the largest Austrian glacier near its highest peak, the Grossglockner. It's thinning by about 1 meter (3 feet) per year on average, and by about 9 meters (29.5 feet) near the glacier's snout. A recent update from World Glacier Monitoring Service says the Austrian decline is in line with recent global averages. Readings from 130 glaciers around the world showed an average thinning of 1.1 meters (3.6 feet) in 2015. Since 1980, the world's glaciers have thinned on average by almost 20 meters (65.6 feet). The world's glaciers outside the polar regions contain enough water to raise global sea level by 0.3 to 0.6 meters (1 to 2 feet), which would swamp some low-lying islands and worsen coastal flooding during storm surges and hurricanes. About 670 million people would be affected. As Alpine glaciers retreat because of climate change, golden eagles are being trained to soar above the mountains armed with cameras to document their vanishing beauty for a new nature film.

{"id": null, "body": "     The picturesque tropical islands are surrounded by water, yet shortages are a daily reality for many. Rising temperatures and low rainfall could make matters worse. Caribbean islands like Barbados may be surrounded by beautiful turquoise waters but many are struggling with water scarcity Noreen Nunez lives in a middle-class neighborhood that rises up a hillside in Trinidad's Tunapuna-Piarco region. Accessed by a long, winding road bordered by trees, the houses, built in the 1970s and 1980s, are mainly painted in pastel shades. Dotted among fruit trees in their sizeable\u00a0 backyard s are \u00a0huge water tanks, mounted on concrete slabs . \u00a0 The tanks are evidence that even this affluent community is not insulated from the water-stress experienced across the Caribbean. Residents fill the tanks from the main pipes to use during scheduled outages by the water authority. But the supply is often unreliable and further impacted by low pressure for those living further up the hill. Nunez says outages have become a regular occurrence, with water often shut off for all but a few hours during the night. \"Most of the time you have to buy food from outside or have food catered and buy bottles of water to drink,\" she said. \"You use disposable dishes.\" Water tanks, which have become vital to dealing with water shortages Antigua and Barbuda, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and St. Kitts and Nevis are all classed as water scarce , which the UN defines as countries with less than 1000 cubic meters per capita of renewable water resources a year. Barbados' situation, with only 350 cubic meters per capita, is especially grave, according to Keith roy \u00a0Halliday, general manager of the Barbados Water Authority. While most people outside of rural mountainous areas in the Caribbean are connected to the public water supply, they frequently face outdated infrastructure in need of repair, resulting in major losses of drinking water. Alan Poon King, head of Trinidad and Tobago's Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA), says the utility loses as much as 60 million gallons of water each day from leaking infrastructure \u2014 and that much again is wasted by problems like leaking taps on private properties. Climate change has increased drought which is exacerbating water problems on the islands The picture is similar in Jamaica, which Peter Clarke, managing director of the country's Water Resources Authority, says suffers from \"a serious loss of water that has been produced and is supposed to be delivered, but it is not reaching the end user because of the aging infrastructure \u2014 it's leaky, it's perforated.\" If these structural problems are left unaddressed, things are only likely to deteriorate as the planet heats up. \"There are many other problems that are facing the water sector in the Caribbean and climate change is exacerbating those existing, underlying conditions,\" said Adrian Cashman, who sits on the global technical advisory committee for the Global Water Partnership. Officials say drought conditions across the region over the past couple of years mean there just hasn't been enough rain to replenish aquifers at the usual rate. \"This past summer [in Jamaica] we went through a significant drought,\" said Clarke. \"It really was challenging for the water supply providers.\" In Trinidad and Tobago, Poon King said it was difficult to quantify the impacts of climate change, but that it was an ongoing challenge: \"We've seen reduced precipitation that could be anywhere in the range of 10-20% in the dry season.\" Last year Puerto Rico experienced water rationing following a drought Halliday said climate change has already \"significantly impacted\" Barbados' water supply, too. All of Barbados' internal renewable water resources come from rainfall, he explained, and in 2019 the country saw its lowest recorded levels since 1947. The Caribbean region enjoys relatively high standards of living, with most countries defined by the UN as \"upper-middle income.\" This excludes them from much international development funding. At the same time, high levels of public debt combined with their vulnerability to climate change makes it difficult to secure investment in infrastructure.\u00a0 However, one of the region's first major water projects financed by the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which was set up to help developing countries cope with the changing climate, is currently underway in Grenada. Project head Hans-Werner Theisen says about half of the $42.9\u00a0million (35.4\u00a0million euros) the GCF has allocated to the project will be spent improving infrastructure like water tanks, reservoirs and pipes. There will also be financial incentives to cut water waste from sectors like agriculture and tourism, which are among the biggest consumers of water. Encouraging the public to use water more carefully is key to the project in Grenada, too. \"What I think is very important is that everyone, every citizen, can contribute to water-saving measures, so we have to be water-wise in day-to-day living,\" Theisen said. Elsewhere, Barbados has passed laws prohibiting the use of potable water for washing cars, gardening, filling swimming pools and similar activities. As in Jamaica, people are encouraged to use wastewater for such activities. Barbados and Jamaica encourage residents to be very careful with their water use Despite day-to-day water outages, a 2017 UN Water report \u00a0showed most people in the Caribbean have access to a safe \u2014 if irregular \u2014 water supply. But in Trinidad, Nunez is infuriated living on an island with 360-views of the turquoise waters and nothing coming out of the tap. \"Water and air are things that humans need to live,\" she added. \"I can't understand how on an island surrounded by water, they can't find some way of using \u2014 desalinating \u2014 the water.\" According to 2019 figures , the region gets some 12% of its water supply from desalination. Poon King said in Trinidad and Tobago that figure is 20% but expanding this is problematic due to high energy costs. For Nunez, water shortages are out of step with her country's development status. Trinidad and Tobago have profited from its oil reserves. Yet despite its high income, it struggles to adequately supply this most basic of necessities. \"There are glass buildings and universities and huge international airports and everything like this, but there is no water,\" she said. \"We've got the latest architectural structures and homes and houses, but it seems like indoor sanitary ware and kitchens are just for show.\" In some parts of the world access to freshwater is taken for granted, but it's actually a luxury. Freshwater only makes up 2.5% of the world's total volume, and more than half of that is ice. Agriculture uses 70% of what's actually usable. By 2050, two-thirds of the world's population is expected to suffer from water scarcity, which will affect all aspects of people's lives. Competition for land is growing across the globe. As the world's population continues to grow, the available land doesn't and is increasingly degrading. Extreme weather events due to climate change add to the equation. Countries with a large population or scarce land areas for agriculture, such as China and Saudi Arabia, are already seeking land in Africa. Land is seen as the new gold. And speaking of oil, fossil fuels should surely have a place at the table of the world's scarce resources if anything because they can't be replenished. Continuing today's rate of consumption will eventually lead to their depletion. This could prove a huge challenge for countries, like Iraq and Libya, which have traditionally had large oil and natural gas reserves. The same goes for coal. Even if countries like Germany are reluctant to move away from this polluting source of energy, the reserves are emptying. In Poland, lignite (or brown coal) reserves from operating mines are expected to run out by 2030. Hard coal might last a little longer, but not much, experts say. Therefore, the country might be forced to break up with coal soon \u2013 even if it hurts. If we think of a desert, sand seems infinite, but its natural production is actually a rather slow process. Sand is a renewable resource, but it's being used at such a fast rate for things like construction that nature doesn't have time to reproduce it. In developing regions like East Africa, where the population is expected to double by roughly 2050, sand could become a scarce resource. Careless behavior with regard to all living beings on this planet is pushing several species to the brink of extinction. Animals are widely seen as resource for humans, and as such pangolins, rhinos, vaquitas or seahorses could be included in the list of scarce natural resources. If they continue to be exploited resources unsustainably, human life will be at risk. It seems like everything is falling apart and as if nothing more can be done to prevent a bleak future. Yet, one thing that's still available is time, a scarce but extremely valuable resource. Some say the climate emergency could still be reversed if action is taken over the next 12 years. And for once, we are allowed to exploit a resource to the fullest. There is no time to lose.

{"id": null, "body": "     Judges in Strasbourg have green-lit a landmark climate case that could hold governments accountable for moving too slowly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Court of Human Rights has told the governments of 33 industrialized countries to promptly respond to a climate lawsuit lodged by six youth campaigners in September, giving it priority status because of the \"importance and urgency of the issues raised.\" The young people, supported by the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), allege the countries \u2014 which include Germany, the UK, Russia and Portugal \u2014 have failed to enact the emission cuts needed to protect their futures.\u00a0 The case focuses on countries whose policies lawyers argue are too weak to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0 Paris Agreement \u00a0goal. They cite the country ratings of the Climate Action Tracker .\u00a0 The plaintiffs range from age\u00a08 to 21 and come from Lisbon and Leiria in Portugal. The case states climate change poses a rising threat to the six young people's lives and their physical and mental well-being. It invokes\u00a0 human rights \u00a0arguments \u2014 including the right to life, a home and to family \u2014 as well as claiming discrimination.\u00a0 \"Our generation is living in an age of great danger and uncertainty, so our voice must be heard,\"\u00a0said Andre Oliveira, 12, whose father is translating for him. Andre, 12, and his sister Sofia, 15, are two of the six young people filing the climate case in Strasbourg\u00a0 The climate case is the first of its kind to be filed at the European Court of Human Rights \"It's clearly not the case that young people are the only people vulnerable to the effects of climate change,\"\u00a0said Gerry Liston, legal officer at GLAN. \"But because they stand to endure the worst impacts , we're saying the effects of failing to adequately address greenhouse gas emissions amounts to unlawful discrimination on the grounds of age.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's not about finger-pointing, but all about giving all these 33 governments a chance to act better and faster,\"\u00a0said Andre. While there are numerous recent and ongoing climate cases, many also involving young plaintiffs, it is the first of its kind to be brought to Strasbourg. The international court, set up in 1959, deals with alleged violations of civil and political rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.\u00a0 The pressing need for significant and wide-scale action among many large emitters warranted going directly to Strasbourg, rather than through domestic courts which\u00a0is more common, explains Liston. According to GLAN, if successful, the 33 countries would be legally bound to tackle overseas contributions to climate change, including that of multinational companies, as well as ramping up emissions cuts. Many of the young people cited experiencing the deadly Portuguese wildfires\u00a0of 2017 as motivation Catarina, 20, says governments need to act to make the planet habitable for future generations The plaintiffs belong to three families and became involved in the case after hearing about GLAN's climate work through a local contact. Many cited seeing climate change hit their doorsteps as encouraging them to act, particularly the deadly Portuguese wildfires in 2017.\u00a0 \"I directly experienced the terror of the fires,\"\u00a0said Catarina Mota, 20, one of the four that live in Leiria, one of the areas hardest hit. Rising sea levels, the constant threat of forest fires \u00a0and increasingly abnormal temperatures are now part of her everyday reality. \"These changes make me feel apprehensive,\"\u00a0she said, adding sometimes the heat makes it hard to breathe or sleep. In July this year the hottest temperatures \u00a0 in 90 years were registered in the country.\u00a0 \"What motivated me to be involved in this case was the desire for a world where one can at least survive,\"\u00a0said Catarina. \"Because if nothing is done by our governments this will not happen.\" Climate action , such as this case, is necessary \"in order to have a future and a healthy life without fear\"\u00a0said plaintiff Claudia Agostinho, 21. \"Our generation and all future generations deserve this.\" The case focuses on 33 high emitters of greenhouse gases The Strasbourg case is one of a growing wave of climate litigation around the world. According to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and Environment \u00a0, while the majority happen in the US, over the last year climate cases were filed across six continents, 80% of them against governments.\u00a0\u00a0 It also noted a recent increase in litigation by activists and advocacy groups, and the use of human rights arguments.\u00a0 While there are ongoing cases in many countries \u2014 including South Korea, Peru, and Canada \u2014 regarding states' human rights obligations to mitigate climate change, the most recent high-profile example is the Dutch Urgenda case \u00a0. In 2019, the country's Supreme Court became the first highest level domestic court to establish a state's duty to significantly and immediately reduce emissions in line with human rights obligations. This summer activists were also successful \u00a0in taking the Irish government to court over climate action failures. Greta Thunberg is among 16 youth activists who also have an ongoing legal complaint to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.\u00a0\u00a0 Greta Thunberg (center) is among a group of 16 children that have filed a legal complaint at the UN Liston says the case highlights there are people who will suffer the severe impact of climate change in their lifetime \"I think one case inspires the other,\"\u00a0said Caroline Schroeder, from Germanwatch, an NGO supporting nine\u00a0young people with a constitutional climate complaint \u00a0in Germany. She sees the Strasbourg case and growing trend of climate litigation as born of the same mounting frustration driving the Fridays for Future movement \u2014\u00a0namely, that \"politics is not doing enough.\"\u00a0 \"I wish we wouldn't have to bring the cases,\"\u00a0said Roda Verheyen, a climate lawyer working on the People's Climate Case filed against the EU institutions. \"But it is essentially still the case that the level of protection afforded to our children by the legislators is too low. And that's why the courts will keep seeing these cases.\"\u00a0 Verheyen points out that in emphasizing a general duty to protect rather than challenging a specific law, the Strasbourg case is less concrete than others she has worked on. Yet a win there could have wide-reaching implications for member states, she adds, and even a loss could potentially \"reinforce the strength of the litigation both in national cases and on the EU level.\" It's ultimate strength, Liston argues, is in bringing home the time perspective and imminence of the threat. \"This case shows that there are people who stand to suffer horrendous effects of climate change within their lifetime,\"\u00a0said Liston.\u00a0 The youngest plaintiff, now 8, will be 28, in 2040, the year in which the UN panel of scientists\u00a0expect many of the most severe consequences of climate change to unfold.\u00a0 Andre, 12, said he hopes the case will bring \"acknowledgement of the voice of a generation that lives with high anxiety and increasing fear of incoming catastrophes, but also a generation that has all the hope that things will change.\"\u00a0 This article was updated on 30.11.2020 to include the decision from the European Court of Human Rights.

{"id": null, "body": "     As the Earth warms, climate change-related disasters are on the rise. More people are being killed as a result of heatwaves, droughts and storms. In 2018, Japan, the Philippines and Germany were hit particularly hard. To what extent have extreme weather events inflicted casualties and financial losses around the world? And which countries are worst-affected? The answers to these questions have been provided by the Global Climate Risk Index. For 14 years, the environmental and development organization, Germanwatch, has presented this report at the annual United Nations climate conference (COP). For\u00a02018, the index revealed Japan, the Philippines and Germany were hardest hit by weather extremes. At the top of the ranking is Japan where 1,282 people lost their lives as a result of extreme rainfall, heatwaves and typhoons last year.\u00a0The total damage was equivalent to \u20ac32 billion ($35 billion) and led to the loss of 0.6% of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) The figures are sourced from the database of reinsurance company Munich Re. Covering 30,000 natural disasters, their NatCaTSERVICE database is one of the largest of its kind in the world, making it possible to compare the impact of extreme weather events in different countries. From the number of deaths per million inhabitants and the amount of damage per GDP, experts determine the ranking of each country. Read more:\u00a0 Climate Risk Index: 2017 broke records for extreme weather In 2018, Japan was hit by three extremely severe weather events. In July, unusually heavy rainfall\u00a0triggered\u00a0 floods and mudslides, resulting in the deaths of over 200 people. Over 5,000 houses were damaged and 2.3 million people had to be evacuated. Overall, the rainfall caused \u20ac6 billion worth of damage. Just a few weeks later, a severe heatwave \u00a0led to a new national temperature record of 41.1 degrees Celsius (106.9 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2014 recorded in the central city of Kumagaya. At least 138 people died as a result\u00a0and more than 70,000 had to be hospitalized suffering from heat shock and heat exhaustion. In September, Typhoon Jebi became the strongest typhoon to strike Japan in 25 years , causing losses of around \u20ac11 billion. Typhoon Jebi was the strongest storm to hit Japan since 1993 and is the second-costliest typhoon on record Heavy rains batter the Philippines during Typhoon Mangkut. The category five storm was the third-strongest tropical cyclone worldwide in 2018. The Philippines takes second place The Philippines was also hit hard by extreme weather in 2018. In September, the powerful Typhoon Mangkhut raged through the northern part of the country . In fact, it was the strongest\u00a0storm recorded in 2018, with wind speeds reaching up to 270 kilometers per hour (167 miles per hour). More than 250,000 people were affected, with casualties mainly caused by landslides following the heavy rain. According to the NatCaTSERVICE database, there were a total of 455 fatalities in the Philippines as a result of extreme weather last year, with total damages amounting to $4.5 billion \u2014 corresponding to a 0.5% percent loss of GDP. Read more:\u00a0 Philippines: Hundreds of thousands evacuated as Typhoon Kammuri hits Germany strongly affected for the first time The latest risk index ranks\u00a0Germany third among the countries most heavily impacted by extreme weather events. In 2018, the country experienced severe heat and drought . Between April and July, the average temperature was 16.6 degrees Celsius \u2014 2.9 degrees higher than before industrialization (approx. 1870). It was the hottest average temperature ever measured in Germany for this period. According to the Munich Re database, the heatwave was responsible for 1,246 deaths in 2018. In addition to this, Germany also experienced high crop losses. The German Farmers' Association (DBV) estimates harvest losses in some regions ranged from 50% to 70%. Approximately 8,000 farmers applied for state emergency aid, with the federal government and states providing \u20ac340 million in relief funds. In addition, Germany suffered severe storm damage in January and September. According to the Risk Index, Germany's total weather-related losses amounted to \u20ac4.5 billion in 2018. This corresponds to a 0.1% drop in GDP. A recent report from the German government paints an alarming picture of the severity of climate change in the country. It claims the average air temperature in Germany increased by 1.5 degrees between 1881 and 2018 and by 0.3 degrees in the last five years alone. \"It's unthinkable to imagine what it would mean if [warming] continues at this rate,\" Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said during the presentation of the report in late November.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0 Will extreme weather become even deadlier? Developing countries hardest hit in the long-term \"The Climate Risk Index shows that the massive impacts of climate change are increasing worldwide,\" says Maik Winges, co-author of the report. \"Industrialized nations such as Germany or Japan are being increasingly affected. By comparison, the poorest countries in the world are exposed to even greater risks , especially because they have so far received little help for the damage and loss they have suffered by the main culprits of climate change.\" More than 495,000 people worldwide were killed by extreme weather events over the past 20 years, according to the Munich Re database. The total economic damage during this period amounted to \u20ac3200 billion. In the long-term index complied over the past 20 years, seven out of the ten most affected countries are classed as developing counties. Puerto Rico was hit particularly hard by Hurricane Maria in 2017 . Around 3,000 people died as a result of the storm out of a population of approximately 3.2 million. The authors of the report cite Puerto Rico as just one example of the growing number of countries in which a single devastating hurricane can cause massive damage that takes years to rebuild. Another trend is also emerging: \"In countries such as Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan, extreme weather conditions are recurring in such short intervals that they have little opportunity to recover from these disasters,\"\u00a0co-author Vera K\u00fcnzel said from the climate conference in Madrid. For this reason, she says it is important that poor nations receive adequate support from countries driving climate change, not just when it comes to the issue of adaptation, but also in unavoidable damages and losses. \"This climate summit must find answers to the question of how the amount of support required in poor countries should be determined on a regular basis, as well as how this necessary financial aid can then be provided,\" stressed K\u00fcnzel. The summer of 2019 saw heat records in Europe broken across the continent. In July, Germany recorded its highest temperature ever at 42.6 C (108 F). France broke its heat record twice in 2019, the highest temperature measuring 46.C (114.8 F) in July. Climate change increases the frequency of heat waves. In November 2019, the Italian archipelago city of Venice experienced multiple flooding events and the high water mark of 1.5 meters was reached three times in one week for the first time in recorded history. Projected sea level rise due to climate change could make these events more likely in the future. The same heat wave that brought record temperatures to France sparked the worst wildfires to hit Spain in 20 years. On the Spanish island of Gran Canaria, wildfires in August decimated a national park on the popular tourist island. Hotter temperatures and drier air due to climate change increase the risk of fires. A combination of drought, storms and extreme heat is depleting Germany's forests. According to BDF, a forest advocacy group, in Germany, more than 1 million established trees have died since 2018. \"These are no longer single unusual weather events. That is climate change,\" said a BDF representative. A glacier on the Italian side of Mont Blanc experienced accelerated melting in 2019. And enthusiasts held a \"funeral\" for the Pizol glacier in the Swiss Alps, which has almost completely disappeared. Scientists say climate change accelerates glacial melting in the Alps. Two consecutive years of drought in Germany have hit farmers hard. In 2018, record drought caused major crop failures, and heat waves in 2019 also damaged crops. \"Climate change means more frequent droughts and extreme weather events in Germany,\"said German Weather Service Vice President Paul Becker. \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Germany among top three countries suffering most from extreme weather events", "article_name": "germany-among-top-three-countries-suffering-most-from-extreme-weather-events", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/germany-among-top-three-countries-suffering-most-from-extreme-weather-events/a-51529140", "date_published": "2019-12-04 00:00:00", "article_length": 8589, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:38.056767"}
{"id": null, "body": "     As a prominent Fridays for Future activist, Vanessa Nakate tells DW how climate activism looks different in her native Uganda and why she's recently been tweeting in German. From Uganda and in her early 20s, Vanessa Nakate started protesting against climate inaction outside the Ugandan government gates in 2019. She's on a mission to raise awareness about the issue within Africa and internationally because she has seen the impacts of climate change already on her own community. DW: When you started Fridays for Future activism in Uganda, you were very much alone right at the beginning. At what point did you think, 'OK, I should continue this or I'm going to give up'? Vanessa Nakate: \u00a0 I just felt like I had to continue striking, especially because I was still doing it by myself. But then as time went on, more and more people started to get involved in different parts of the country doing the climate strikes. And also in the entire African continent, more activists started coming up and doing the climate strikes and demanding action. And to me, that is enough of a motivation to keep me doing activism, knowing that I am not doing it alone, and that there are millions of young people from different parts of the world striking and demanding climate action. How does climate activism in your country differ from what it looks like in Europe? We're used to seeing big Fridays For Future strikes here, but what does it look like in Uganda? Well, of course there is a big difference between the activism in Uganda and in Europe. This is mainly because of two things. One is awareness. Many people are not yet aware of\u00a0the dangers. They don't have the facts. They don't have the clear science about what is happening when it comes to the climate crisis. And then the other thing is freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is not the same as we see it is in Europe and it's also harder for students here to walk out of school and do the climate strikes. If I want to do climate strikes with students, I have to go in the schools because many of them, they have a fear of walking out of school. Just walking out would subject you to either suspension or expulsion. Also getting permits for marches every Friday is very hard, especially if you don't have a strong organization that is behind you, that is supporting you. So activism in my country \u2014 or probably in any other African country \u2014\u00a0is different because of such restrictions. With that in mind, how do you get people motivated to go on strikes? By sharing on social media. That is \u2014 mainly on Twitter and Facebook \u2014 I would share my strikes every Friday and many people would ask questions about what I was doing and why I was doing that. The other way\u00a0is going into schools and requesting principals, director of schools to talk to students on Friday so that I get to discuss with them the challenges that our planet faces and their role in securing a better future. One other way,\u00a0we've been doing community reach-outs where we go to local communities and do cleanups, because most of these people, they don't have access maybe to a television. They don't watch the news. They don't know the challenges that the world is facing. So through these local reach-outs or doing cleanups, we get to speak to them, we get to explain to them how they can protect the planet, what they can do for our home, because all of us have a responsibility to play. The Global Strike 4 Climate in Uganda's capital Kampala in 2019 Climate change is obviously a difficult thing to explain to anybody in the world. But for you, what are the main issues locally that you are dealing with? I have clearly seen the danger that climate change places on people's lives and the danger is mainly an issue of food scarcity and water scarcity for people. A large percentage of the people in Uganda are heavily dependent on agriculture as a source of survival, and that is mainly the people in the rural communities. It also affects those in the urban centers because they get food from the rural communities. It also brings about other problems of seeing more street children on the streets of Kampala. This is because many of them, they're trying to run away from their lands. They're trying to find a better way of survival. Also, availability of access to clean water for the people, because when it floods, that means the water will still be contaminated. It's submerged even toilets, not just the farms, it also submerged drainage. That means any water source that the community was relying on was also contaminated by the dirt from the toilets. So you find that, even in the flood there is a water scarcity. You, as well as\u00a0I guess your colleagues one could call them\u00a0from Europe, have a whole set of different agendas regarding what issues are important within Europe, as opposed to what is important across Africa or Asia. Has it ever been difficult working with them? No. I believe in a way, yes, the demands are different, the urgency is different \u2014 when it comes to Europe, it isn't as urgent as it is in Africa with the climate crisis. So in Europe, you find that most of the activists, they are mainly targeting the politicians and the leaders in making decisions that will ensure that different parts of the world are protected, that will ensure that the Earth is protected. Vanessa Nakate with fellow Fridays For Future activists Shari Crespi of Spain (left) and Greta Thunberg (center) at a press conference during the COP25 summit in Madrid in 2019 I personally may not have reach to the leaders who determine the existence of the fossil fuel industry, who determine whether we are going to transition to a more sustainable future. Most of those leaders, they have so much influence as well in some of the countries on the African continent. So I feel like if they're able to reach out to those leaders in the European Parliament and put pressure on them to take the decisions that would save our planet, that also helps me out, that also helps the people of my country. As you point out, places across Africa, whether it's the Sahel, whether it's the coastal areas, they have much more to lose than what we see in Europe. But for you, how does this make you feel when you can see that Africans are actually in a more dangerous position than the Europeans are, but that Africans have so little influence on that? As a climate activist, of course, I understand that we have tried so much to ask for representation of every activist on the world stage, in discussions. But it is one thing to see that representation, but it's another thing for that representation to carry the same weight. The weight of influence \u2014 it is not the same. The question is: Will they listen to what I will say? Will they find it important if I say it? What if I say the same thing today and no one pays attention to it and another activist from Europe says the same thing and it's given much attention? What's your message to people across Africa about climate? No pressure. For the people of Africa, no one is going to fight for you when it comes to the climate crisis. If Africa experiences issues with the climate crisis, many times, we first look out for international media to talk about it. But now we need African media. We can only save our continent if we work together. And unfortunately, it's not something that we are seeing right now. Recently, you've actually been tweeting in German to try and get the message across. What made you do this? Well, I did that because I was really angry and disturbed by the fact that Germany chose to push coal to 2038 . I feel like that helps them and that doesn't help communities that are already being affected by the climate crisis. I feel like 2038 is too late. It's unnecessary and very dangerous for communities that are already facing devastating impacts of climate change. So tweeting in German was a message to Germany, to the entire world. It was a message saying: 'I am watching you, as an activist. We are watching you and the decisions that you are making, they are not good for us. They are not good for our future. You have to reconsider and understand that we have no time left.'

{"id": null, "body": "     Bangladesh is on the front line of climate change, as its low-lying delta farmlands face surging floods. But floating gardens \u2013 a traditional form of hydroponics \u2013 is offering a lifeline to some farming families. Where the Ganges and Bramhaputra rivers converge at the Bay of Bengal, they form a vast fertile delta. Sediment brought down from the Himalayas means this has long been a region of agricultural plenty. But as climate change pushes up the sea level and storms become more frequent and more severe, its inhabitants and way of life are among the most threatened on the planet. As saltwater seeps into once-fertile land, farmers are giving up agriculture and looking for new ways to make a living.

But the impact of shrimp farming on the delta coast is hastening its destruction. Some families, though, are turning to a more traditional, and less harmful strategy to make the most of their changing environment. Aquatic plants and straw are woven together to create a floating platform on which crops are planted. Bangla Delta farmers have been doing this for hundreds of years.

This farmer in Pirojpun shows the delicately wrapped seedlings she's preparing to plant on her floating garden. Leafy vegetables, okra, gourd, eggplant, pumpkin and onions all thrive on the raft gardens. Out on the water, they are less vulnerable to pests and don't require chemical fertilizers.

Then, it was the worst the country had suffered for years. Hari Podo, a farmer from Gopalganj district, and his family had no place to escape the rising waters, he recalls. So, they turned to a practice honed by his ancestors. Podo collected water hyacinth, a floating plant common in the canals, and built a raft a few meters wide and about 10 meters long. With his family and animals, he stepped aboard. \"We lived on the hyacinth raft,\" Podo told DW. \"Humans to one side and domestic animals to the other. We slept and cooked food on the floating plants. We lived there for about two months, on water.\" Back then, reviving traditional floating gardens saved Podo's family. Now, as flooding becomes an ever-greater threat, it could save many more livelihoods. Hari Podo navigates between floating gardens, much like the one he and his family took refuge on 30 years ago Between the devil\u2026 \"Seasons have changed,\" Podo said. \"Nowadays rain is heavier than before.\" Bangladesh is trapped between the melting ice caps of the Himalayas, increasingly violent monsoons from the north, and the rising tides of Bay of Bengal to the south. \"People have started to adapt,\" Zahid Shashoto of Uttaran, a development NGO based in Satkhira, told DW. \"Maybe farmers don't know the problem, but they are looking for solutions as they have done for centuries.\" In the south, the rising sea level combined with natural subsidence is letting salt water into the once-fertile Ganges-Bramhaputra delta soil; into farmer's fields and wells. Between 2000 and 2009, salt-water intrusion crept 15 kilometers north of the southern coast. Today, during dry season, it reaches 160 kilometers inland and threatens 40 percent of farmland in southern Bangladesh. With climate change putting this rich and fertile environment under pressure, farmers are being forced to adapt \"Salty waters harm agriculture,\" said Mahmud Shamsuddoha head of the Center for Participatory Research and Development in Dhaka. \"The more you go the south, the more you see that agriculture is not profitable anymore.\" Shamsuddoha told DW that over the last decade, agriculture's share in GDP has fallen from 50 percent to around 20 percent. From agriculture to aquaculture Some farmers are giving up and looking for work in urban areas. Others are turning to shrimp farming. Joggadish Mallick lives in the tiny village of Parmagur Khali in the Satkhira district. At 59, he's seen his home change dramatically over his decades. \"Farmers are struggling,\" he said, leading the way to his shrimp ponds with bare feet stepping nimbly onto narrow, slippery mud dykes. \"Most of them are leaving the village and are migrating to cities. Some work in garment industries in Dhaka, others pull a van in Khulna.\" For those left behind, shrimp farming is a better source of income than the back-breaking work of farming unproductive land. \"Today we are not in deep poverty. By farming shrimps we are better-off,\" Mallick told DW. Joggadish Mallick says shrimp farming has kept his family out of poverty \u2014 but at a cost to the environment Shrimps are now the country's second-biggest export \u2014 after clothing \u2014 mostly going to the European Union. But aquaculture has a high social and environmental cost. \"The beauty of our area is long gone, there are hardly any trees here,\" Mallick said. \"There were a lot of people, we had a good life. Now, due to saltwater intrusion and shrimp farm ponds, such beautiful environment is disappearing.\" And with the coast eroding fast under onslaught of unusually forceful cyclones, even shrimp farming's days could be numbered. Mallick believes it is only a matter of time before his and the surrounding villages are deserted. Building on the swamp In districts like Gopalganj, Jessore and Kuhlna, saltwater intrusion isn't yet a problem. But floods are. With farmers' futures no longer certain, some are adapting to the new conditions. Giassudin Saddar grows bananas, guava, coconuts, mangoes and okra. His patch of land is surrounded tall, leafy trees and a maze of canals. \"We love our rivers and our canals, we are used to this life,\" Saddar said proudly. Boats moor at Nazir Bazar's floating market, where farmers sell produce grown on top of the rising waters His village, Nazir Bazar in the district of Piorjpun, rises from land that was once marshy forest. Villagers piled soil onto the swampy ground and dug canals to keep it drained, creating a solid base for their homes and gardens. Kids dive from the shady banks of the canals into their greenish waters. They use boats to get to school, just as their parents make the journey to market. Unlike Mallick, the shrimp farmer, Saddar is optimistic about the future. \"Whatever we face \u2014 rivers, canals, rain, floods \u2014 we have learned to live with a changing environment,\" he told DW. Living rafts For others, the answer is a traditional form of hydroponics unique to this part of the world. For hundreds of years, villagers have been using paddy straw and aquatic plants to create islands of organic material up to around 20 meters (65 feet) in length. The technique was dying out. But now farmers see it as a way to cope with the changing weather and increasingly threatening floods. Farmers in the Bangla Delta have used hydroponics for centuries. Now, this unique technology is needed more than ever Men and women work side-by-side to build\u00a0their living rafts, and their produce is organic. Growing on the water, the crops are less vulnerable by pests\u00a0and don't require fertilizers. Each floating platforms last around three months. After that, it's brought ashore and used to fertilize crops grown on land. In this way, water hyacinth, an invasive species that thrives even when salt contaminates the water, and is generally seen as a pest, has become something of a hero plant, forming the perfect base for floating gardens.\u00a0 Shamsuddoha points out that the rafts are only a solution for particular environments and says he fears that as the sea level keeps rising, the increasing salinization could prove toxic even for hardy plants like the water hyacinth. But for now, for some families at least, floating agriculture has proved a lifeline that\u00a0a recent report from the Deakin University in Australia says, \"could enormously support a farming community in achieving sustainable development.\" The Indonesian capital Jakarta is sinking. At the same time, sea levels are rising. Now the megacity is fighting back against the rising tide \u2014 and for its very survival.

We decode the meaning behind some of the key terms being thrown around in the international climate debate.  2 degrees Celsius Keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is a target for tackling climate change adopted by the UNFCCC at COP16 in 2010. As far back as the 1970s, scientists predicted that a global temperature rise of 2 degrees C would set in motion devastating and irreversible consequences. More recently, scientists have warned that around this temperature, ice sheets will begin to melt at an uncontrollable rate, resulting in massive sea level rise.  400 ppm In March 2013, the global concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere stayed over 400 parts per million for a month for the first time in recorded history - and perhaps for the first time in 25 million years. Some scientists had considered this to be a milestone - albeit a negative one - for climate change. CO2 concentration of 400 ppm represents a rise of 85 ppm since measurements began in 1958. And scientists add that the rate of change is increasing to an alarming 2.75 ppm per year.  Adaptation Many countries, particularly in the Global South, are already suffering from rising sea levels, droughts, floods and extreme weather events as a result of climate change. In order to cope, they need to build new infrastructure, protect homes and farmland, and switch to crops that can cope with the changing climatic conditions. A portion of the pledged climate finance (see below) is earmarked to help developing countries cover the costs of adapting to a warmer planet. Nations in the Global South are already suffering the effects of climate change, such as increased drought and floods  Carbon bubble The carbon bubble refers to the idea that energy companies are vastly overvalued because share prices assume that business will carry on as usual. If governments were to enact the legislation needed to limit global emissions, the theory goes, their current business models would be blown apart, and many of their assets would be greatly devalued. If only 565 billion tons of CO2 were to be emitted instead of the possible 2,795 billion tons (see \"carbon budget\" below), the stock value of companies involved in coal, oil and natural gas would drop by an estimated $20 trillion dollars, according to some estimates.  Carbon budget Scientists say that in order to stand a chance of keeping within the 2-degree Celsius limit, we may emit more than 565 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2050. According to a 2010 report form the Carbon Tracker Initiative, potential emissions from all known reserves of coal, oil and natural gas amount to 2,795 billion tons - five times the \"allowable\" carbon budget. This would mean that 80 percent of unburned carbon should stay in the ground.  Carbon price One approach to reducing greenhouse emissions is to make companies pay for every ton of CO2 they release into the atmosphere. The idea is to give industry an incentive to reduce their fossil fuel use, and make green alternatives more competitive. Cap-and-trade schemes like the European Union Emissions Trading System put a limit on emissions and issue allowances that companies can trade so they can pay for the right to emit more - or make a profit my emitting less and selling surplus allowances. Carbon pricing is intended to make renewable energy more competitive than carbon-intensive fossil fuel  Climate finance At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, richer countries committed to raising $100 billion per year by 2020 to support climate action in developing countries. This may be public or private money, and can take the form of loans. Much of it is channeled through the Green Climate Fund. Climate finance is seen as a key negotiating tool to get developing countries to commit to stronger action on emissions reduction.  COP21 The United Nations Climate Change Conference due to take place in Paris in December 2015 goes by the nickname COP21, shorthand for the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties to the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The objective of the conference is to achieve an agreement to limit climate change and deal with its growing impacts.  Copenhagen Summit The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP15, has become a byword for failure and everything the Paris conference is trying to avoid. The summit aimed to produce a legally binding global agreement to fight climate change. But the Copenhagen Accord drafted at the end of the summit did not contain legally binding commitments to reduce carbon emissions and failed to be unanimously passed by all parties. Protests in Copenhagen calling for a meaningful agreement were not heeded, and COP15 is remembered as a failure  Decarbonization The most efficient way to stop global warming is eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, the majority of which come from fossil fuels. However, such \"decarbonization\" of the economy is a huge challenge, with most of the world's energy and industry dependent on fossil fuels. Environmentalists are calling for the Paris agreement to include a long-term goal to completely end the use of fossil fuels - preferably by halfway through the 21st century.  Divestment Divestment is the opposite of investment. In the context of climate change, this means pulling money out of companies involved in extracting or burning fossil fuels. Universities, charities, churches and pension funds have joined a global movement to divest from fossil fuel companies. The aim is to use consumer pressure to detract from such companies financially, though some argue that the real impact is in delegitimizing the business as a whole.  Emissions gap Carbon reduction measures pledged by each country to date, if fulfilled (see \"INDCs,\" below), are estimated to bring global temperatures to about 2.7 degrees Celsius. The overage of emissions, compared to the 2-degree target (see above), is referred to as the emissions gap. Environmentalists want a carbon-free economy by 2050 - but some say dependency on fossil fuels makes this impossible  Feedback loop Rising temperatures have environmental impacts that in turn accelerate climate change. That's one reason scientists say we are heading for a tipping point, where impacts will intensify at an ever-faster rate. The most striking example is perhaps the melting of the Arctic ice sheets. The ice reflects back the sun's rays - an effect that diminishes as the ice sheets shrink, making the oceans heat up faster - in turn accelerating ice melt.  INDCs Ahead of the COP21 Climate Conference in Paris, each individual member state was called on to submit its individual pledge to reduce carbon emissions. These \"intended nationally determined contributions\" (INDCs) have been criticized for lacking consistency and transparency, in addition to being non-binding.  Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol was the first global agreement that set targets to tackle climate change by reducing carbon emissions. It was agreed in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, but did not come into force until 2005. Under this agreement, only industrialized countries were bound to reduce their emissions. Yet key industrialized nations, like the US, refused to enact the treaty.  Loss and damage Some impacts of climate change cannot be adapted to and have, or will have, a major impact on the economies of in poorer countries in particular. These countries are calling for extra compensation from industrialized nations that have been responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions to date. Ocean acidification: CO2 and global warming are having a devastating impact on marine life  Mitigation Mitigation refers to measures to prevent global warming through reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Ocean acidification Much of the carbon released into the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans. This causes a chemical reaction that produces carbonic acid, raising the water's pH and lowering levels of carbonate that many marine animals need for their skeletons and shells. The process also damages coral reefs. The UN climate summit in Paris has some tough nuts to crack: With global temperatures and CO2 emissions breaking records, greenhouse gas cuts pledged so far will not keep global warming to the agreed-upon limit.

It could leave important gaps in our understanding. Every year 150 climate\u00a0scientists fly far into the wilderness and bore deep into Greenland's largest glacier. Their work is complicated and important. The EastGRIP project is trying to understand how ice streams underneath the glacier are pushing vast amounts of ice into the ocean, and how this contributes to rising sea levels. But this year the drills will be silent. The ice streams will go unmeasured.\u00a0 The reason is the coronavirus. The fallout from measures to contain the outbreak have made the research impossible. Greenland\u00a0is closed to foreigners. Its government is worried any outbreak could be particularly dangerous to its indigenous population and rapidly overwhelm its health services.\u00a0 Even if the country were open, it just isn't practical to bring an international team of scientists together, 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers)\u00a0away from the nearest airport, in case one of them is sick.

Professor Dorthe Dahl-Jensen (r.) with former Danish Research Minister Tommy Ahler \"How does this ice actually flow? That really is what we have been waiting for for five years, what was going to happen this year. All of that has now been put back. We will have to live without the results.\"\u00a0 Damaged equipment When the team returns next year, it's data and understanding they will have lost.

For now, both say they are happier remaining at home and keeping themselves, their teams and everyone else they would otherwise encounter safe.\u00a0 But for younger scientists, those working on research with short-term funding, and those working towards academic qualifications on a timescale, the lack of results is a much bigger problem. The next generation of climate scientists will be affected .\u00a0 \"There are junior colleagues, and this will have a significant impact on their career if they cannot get the data for the project that they need to do their work,\"\u00a0says\u00a0Mankoff. \"My attitude will not be shared by everybody else, and I doubt it is.\" Most productive time of the year Someone who can relate is\u00a0Dr Joran Moen, director of the University Center\u00a0in Svalbard (UCIS) in Norway, the world's northernmost higher education institution. The school was shutdown and fieldwork cancelled, following orders from the Norwegian government. Around 70 students in Svalbard alone will be unable to complete fieldwork contributing to masters degrees or PhDs.\u00a0 \"The transition from March to June is a very important time for operations and for monitoring climate change in the area,\"\u00a0he says. \"We are in a part of the Arctic with a very dramatic change due to the temperature rapidly changing. It's a very good place to be to see how mankind can influence the climate and the effects of it.\" \"As for data gaps, the entire international community on Svalbard will have that problem, and of course that will also impact on our research. For students to be missing something like this in their research is a problem.\"\u00a0 Transport planes that normally resupply the EastGRIP camp have been grounded Waiting game Moen and the UCIS have made provisions for as much education as possible to continue. Classes have moved online and small, risk-free research trips are still being planned. Dahl-Jensen and Mankoff are waiting to see when they can reach their equipment, and planning how much extra work they may have to do in the snow.

{"id": null, "body": "     German politicians reacted to the newly released IPCC report by urging drastic emissions reductions at home and more engagement on climate action abroad. Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said the IPCC report confirmed that extreme weather events will continue to occur in Germany Germany's Development Minister Gerd Mueller said a major global effort was required to combat climate change, urging poorer countries to also invest more in climate protection policies. Mueller told the German Funke media group that only 8 out of 191 countries in the world were adhering to the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, in which\u00a0nations set a goal of capping global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius\u00a0(3.6 Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than\u00a01.5 degrees Celsius, by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The German development minister's remarks come as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a new assessment on the impact of global warming. In the report, scientists have warned that without \"immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions\" to greenhouse gas emissions the Paris goals will not be reached. \"We need a global green deal, with huge private investments to expand renewable energies as well as technology transfers and an investment offensive by industrialized countries in emerging and developing countries,\" Mueller said. Mueller urged the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the development banks and above all the EU to step up.\u00a0 \"Hundreds of new coal-fired power plants are being built or planned around the world,\" the German minister said. \"If all of these 'climate killers' go online, we will never achieve the Paris goals.\"\u00a0 German Green party\u00a0 chancellor candidate in the 2021 elections, Annalena Baerbock, also called for increased international engagement against global warming ahead of the\u00a0COP 26 climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland in November.\u00a0 \"The climate conference in Glasgow must become a climate turning point,\" Baerbock told newspaper Die Welt on Monday \"Only then will we have the chance to move from the current over-three-degree path to the 1.5-degree path of Paris,\" she warned. The Green party chairwoman stressed that Germany needed to employ a rapid expansion of renewable energies, while also leading a \"passionate climate foreign policy.\"\u00a0 \"That's why we will work to ensure that the major emitters in particular submit higher national climate contributions at the World Climate Conference in November,\" Baerbock said. German Federal Environment Minister Svenja Schulze reacted to the IPCC report, saying \"it makes it unequivocally clear that we must prepare for more and more extreme weather events in Germany .\" \"They are not going away because we can't reverse the climate change that has already taken place. We can, however, slow it down,\" she added. Schulze also urged for greater action at home, saying Germany should adopt an amendment in its constitution, so that the federal government can be more involved in protecting against the consequences of climate change.\u00a0 \"I plead for funding together with the federal government, because we need to prepare permanently for more frequent extreme weather events,\" she added. jcg/wmr (dpa, AFP, Reuters) \n As Germany mourns after deadly floods devastated swaths of the country, the cleanup operation goes on.

{"id": null, "body": "     Most people should have realized by now that we're facing a climate crisis. Curbing greenhouse gas emissions is just one side of the problem. Adopting safety precautions is the other, says David Ehl. Faced with disasters like the recent flooding, Germany \u2014 and the world \u2014 needs to adapt The extent of destruction and death wrought by Germany's recent floods is slowly becoming apparent. Dozens of people have died, with many still reported missing. The disaster has\u00a0devastated entire towns, washing away residential houses, cars and trees. David Ehl Natural disasters are nothing new. They occurred long before the advent of the industrial age, when humans began burning fossil fuels on a large scale. Over time, however, atmospheric CO2 concentrations have doubled, raising Earth's temperature by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit). A greater frequency and intensity of natural disasters has been the consequence. As vast swaths of western Germany are dealing with one of the worst floods in years, parts of North America are grappling with scorching hot temperatures\u00a0that have left scores dead \u00a0and sparked forest fires that have proven very difficult to contain. The Northern Hemisphere, in short, is facing\u00a0a climate crisis. Fortunately, there is finally talk of mitigating climate change \u2014 that is, taking measures to counteract its gravest consequences. The European Commission has just unveiled its \"Fit for 55\" plan , a package of revisions and regulations targeted at drastically cutting greenhouse gas emissions. One key policy stipulates that by 2035 sales of vehicles with internal combustion engine cars will be banned. But Armin Laschet, who leads Germany's center-right CDU\u00a0and is vying to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel in September , has said lawmakers should not set specific phaseout dates. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, meanwhile, has lambasted the EU proposal, writing: \"Unless the EU tear up their new #Fitfor55 package, the world will not stand a chance of staying below 1.5\u00b0C of global heating.\" At 32, I'm closer to Thunberg than Laschet, age-wise. The floods and heat waves we are witnessing today are frightening. Are they merely a taste of what's to come once I reach Laschet's age? And what will coming generations be up against? What we need, therefore, are mitigating measures against climate change, alongside steps to adapt to a warming planet. Germany's Federal Statistical Office recorded an 11% increase in deaths during a weeklong heat wave this summer. It is almost unimaginable what would happen if temperatures were to rise to 46, 47 or even 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit), as they have done this summer in the Canadian town of\u00a0Lytton . Lytton, incidentally, lies near 50 degrees north latitude, just like the German towns of Boppard and Coburg, in central Germany. This means we should be taking safety precautions. Reconfiguring our cities could help, for instance by ensuring air can properly circulate in urban conglomerations. Preserving or cultivating green spaces can help lower temperatures. Concrete structures and asphalt surfaces, after all, lock in the heat. There are numerous tried-and-tested tools for dealing with heavy, incessant rainfall and flooding. These go beyond high-capacity sewage pipes and non-return valves. Indeed, dikes, weirs and retention basins further reduce the risk of catastrophic flooding. Regional flood plains act as an additional safety precaution. Cities should consider designing and designating similar flood prevention zones. Rotterdam, for example, boasts a main square with three large basins that can capture rainwater. When the weather is pleasant, meanwhile, locals can hang out on the steps, or go skateboarding. Miami Beach, meanwhile, is taking urgent action to avoid flooding as seawater levels rise\u00a0and hurricanes intensify. Authorities there are working to elevate the city\u00a0and install a network of underground pipelines, basins and powerful water pumps. Countless safety measures like these have been dreamed up already. While they will not work as a panacea and shield us from all destruction wrought by extreme weather events, they can surely minimize the damage. Above all, we need to cut CO2 emissions \u2014\u00a0and develop a greater awareness for how we can protect ourselves against the devastating impacts of climate change. This article has been adapted from German The Canadian town of Lytton saw record-breaking heat on July 2 when temperatures hit nearly 50 degrees Celcius. A few days later, the village was all but destroyed in a wildfire. Experts warn that heat domes like those in North America are becoming more likely due to global warming, which has slowed down the jet stream. This is why such extreme conditions tend to sometimes last for weeks. It\u2019s been the hottest July since 1914 in Lapland with 33.6 C recorded in northern Finland. Parts of Scandinavia have also been experiencing temperatures that are 10-15 degrees above average. Meteorologists say that the record heat in northern Europe is linked to the heat dome above North America. India has also been unusually hot this year. At the beginning of July, the capital New Delhi saw temperatures hit 43C, the hottest ever in nine years. The start of the monsoon season has also been delayed by about a week this year. India has seen at least 6,500 heat-related deaths since 2010. Siberia has also seen sweltering heat this year, with temperatures of over 30C in May, making this region north of the Arctic Circle warmer than many parts of Europe. Drought and high temperatures are also leading to large-scale fires in densely forested Northern Russia. And its permafrost is melting, releasing more and more Co2 and methane into the atmosphere. Winter in the Southern Hemisphere is also unusually warm this year. Hastings, New Zealand saw temperatures rise to 22C last month. It was the warmest June in 110 years, according to the National Meteorological Agency (NIWA). Average temperatures increased by about 2C. Warmer winters pose a problem for agriculture and, of course, ski resorts. At a sizzling 51.4C, Mexico recorded its hottest-ever temperature in June. Mexico is going through its worst drought in 30 years. Baja California is particularly affected and the Colorado River there has partially dried up. Water levels in the reservoirs near Mexico City are also falling. The Arabian Peninsula and North Africa have also been particularly hot this year. The Sahara Desert saw the mercury rise to 50C last month. Meanwhile, in western Libya, it was 10 degrees warmer than usual at the end of June, according to the National Center for Meterology. In the oasis city of Ghadames, the heat rose to 46C, with the capital Tripoli not far behind at 43C.

{"id": null, "body": "     As the US faces wildfires and storms, climate change remains one of the most divisive topics among voters. Yet despite the high stakes, so far, it has played a minor role in the upcoming election. US President Donald Trump has undone many major pieces of climate policy during his term, walking out on the 2015 Paris Agreement \u00a0to limit global warming and eliminating numerous Obama-era environmental regulations.\u00a0\u00a0 Trump's Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, has promised as part of his presidential campaign to invest $1.7 trillion (\u20ac1.4 trillion)\u00a0in a \"clean energy revolution and environmental justice\" over the next decade. It falls some $14 trillion short of what the progressive US senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, pledged on climate action during the Democratic primaries.\u00a0 However, climate change doesn't even make the top 10 concerns among registered voters, even as the US faces extreme weather from wildfires \u00a0to\u00a0 storms , which scientists say are becoming more prevalent\u00a0thanks to global warming. The issue\u00a0ranks 11th behind the economy, health care, Supreme Court appointments and the pandemic, according to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center \u00a0published in August.\u00a0\u00a0 While climate change doesn't top the voters' agenda, it's still one of the most divisive issues among Trump and Biden supporters. Some 68% of Democratic voters see climate change as high priority compared to 11% or Republicans, found the Pew survey.\u00a0 Following a storm in Iowa last month, estimates suggested that almost a third of the state's crop-growing land was affected Wildfires are becoming more frequent in California, where the ground and vegetation has suffered from long, dry summers But what are the Biden \u00a0and Trump campaigns promising to do on climate change and the environment \u2014 and how does it tally with what voters want? Biden, Barack Obama's former vice president,\u00a0plans to recommit to the Paris Accord\u00a0and ensure that the US achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions by 2050. Biden has also promised a halt to fossil fuel subsidies, going further than the Democratic National Committee, the governing body of the Democrats, which dropped that demand from its platform earlier this month.\u00a0 Prior to Kamala Harris' announcement as Biden's running mate , the California senator had been vocal in her support for bold climate action. Harris co-sponsored the New Green Deal, calling on Congress to implement a 10-year government-driven mobilization to decarbonize the economy, while also backing job retraining and social and environmental justice.\u00a0 But some Democratic voters are disappointed with the Biden/Harris ticket, believing Sanders, who dropped out of the Democratic race for president in April , would have been the better candidate.\u00a0 \"I have two kids, so I have to be mindful and hopeful, but I lost a lot of hope since Bernie Sanders didn't get the bid,\" said Karen Antunes, as she wrapped up a picnic with her kids and little dog in Peninsula Park in Portland Oregon.\u00a0 That won't stop her voting Democrat though. \"We have to. The Trump thing has got to end,\" added Antunes. \"But I'm not excited.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Most progressive voters like Antunes might prefer to unite behind Biden against\u00a0Trump's reelection \u00a0even if they don't feel his commitment to climate change action goes far enough. \u00a0\"I don't think the differences between Biden and Sanders on the environment \u2014 or any other issues \u2014 will matter much to Democratic voters compared to the difference between Biden and Trump,\" said Stephen Ansolabehere, director of the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard University. Over the last few years, Trump has dismissed climate change as a \"hoax,\" not human-caused, and called environmental activists \"perennial prophets of doom.\"\u00a0 The US president's 63 bullet-point election agenda, which is divided into categories like \"Jobs,\" \"Eradicate COVID-19\" and \"End our reliance on China,\" makes no direct mention of climate change or the environment.\u00a0\u00a0 Instead, tucked away under the heading \"Innovate for the future\" toward\u00a0the bottom of the list, there are two promises: \"Continue to Lead the World in Access to the Cleanest Drinking Water and Cleanest Air\" and \"Partner with Other Nations to Clean Up our Planet's Oceans.\"\u00a0 The plan outlines no path to clean water or air. In this image from 2015, a resident of Flint holds up a sample of dirty water Los Angeles has a history of bad smog The lack of climate change mentions in Trump's agenda might please many Republican voters since they are \"obviously less supportive of regulations,\" said Daron Shaw, a professor specializing in voting behavior at the University of Texas at Austin and co-director of the Fox News Poll. \"Democrats are much more willing to take stronger measures,\"\u00a0said Shaw, adding that few Republicans support policies such as a significant carbon or fossil fuel tax. \"But if you ask Republicans about recycling, if you ask about fuel efficiency standards, they're very supportive of those sorts of smallish behaviors.\" Some younger Republicans are starting to become critical of their party's inattention to climate change. During the recent Republican National Convention, a small group turned to Twitter during the online event, to ask \"#WhatAboutClimate\"?\u00a0 Another Pew study from June 2020 found that millennial and Gen Z Republicans, currently aged 18 to 39, are more likely than older GOP voters to think humans have a significant impact on the climate and that the federal government is doing too little to tackle the problem. That doesn't mean they're ready to switch allegiance to the Democrats, though.\u00a0 \"Being a Republican is very much rooted in my upbringing,\" said Kiera O'Brien, who founded the group Young Conservatives for Carbon Dividends (YCCD). \"Conservatism at home in Ketchikan, Alaska , has a focus on community and nature.\"\u00a0 O'Brien dislikes the Democrat's \"regulatory approach to climate\" and is instead lobbying for free market solutions to climate change through YCCD. Environmental policies can be a complicated issue when it comes to federal elections and hard to address for presidential candidates. Many regions in the US have unique challenges: from wildfires in California and\u00a0storms wiping out harvests in Iowa\u00a0to water pollution in Flint, Michigan .\u00a0 Harvard's Ansolabehere also pointed out that opposition to climate policies in the past were typically connected to the fear of losing jobs and that prohibiting coal or retooling the auto industry will \"adversely affect employment\" in places like Kentucky and Michigan.\u00a0 Daron Shaw added that Republicans typically \"try to frame environmental issues as a matter of high taxation and job killing proposals with the hope that they can peel off Democrats.\" Biden might be trying to assuage fears that tackling climate change means job losses by framing his plan as an opportunity for employment in new industries and a reinvigorated green manufacturing sector. But when it comes to the swing states of Pennsylvania, Virginia and Ohio, Trump's climate record and support for jobs in the fossil fuel sector might give him the upper hand. His backing for ethane cracker plants, which take natural gas \u00a0and converts it into the basis for making plastics, has received a lot of support, said Ansolabehere, especially from local unions.\u00a0 The protesters' symbol was a clock to signal to those meeting at the United Nations climate change conference (COP24) that time is running out if the world is to limit global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Negotiations at the COP have been tough, with disagreements on financing for developing countries and on how states should report their emissions cuts. Some marchers made giant puppets, including of Brazil's president elect, Jair Messias Bolsonaro, to protest the leader's climate policies. Bolsonaro has threatened to follow US President Donald Trump and withdraw his country from the Paris climate agreement. Bolsonaro has also talked about loosening protections for the Amazon rainforest \u2014 the Earth's green lungs. About seven million people worldwide die prematurely due to air pollution every year. Poland's air quality is particularly bad because of the country's dependence on coal for electricity and heating. Some protesters decorated pollution masks to make a statement about Poland's coal policy. During the COP, the country's president said there was no intention to phase out coal. Some groups, like the International Atomic Energy Agency, are promoting nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. It would provide a stable and greenhouse gas-emission-free energy source, says the IAEA. A number of protesters turned up to advocate against nuclear, because there is no good way to deal with the radioactive waste it produces and because it is potentially unsafe, they say. Sustaina Claus arrived at the climate march with his Christmas elves to preach the message of sustainability. The environmental activist says we need to stop overconsumption if we are to stop climate change and protect the planet's resources. Instead of buying mountains of gifts for your loved ones at Christmas, \"you should give the gift of you.\" NGOs said a number of environmental campaigners were refused entry at the Polish border or deported from the country, having been deemed a \"threat\" to national security. Climate Action Network, an umbrella group of climate groups, called the actions worrying. A spokeswoman for Poland's border guards said she could not say whether the refusals were connected to the COP, according to Reuters. Climate activist Lander Wantens cycled over 1,000 kilometers from Belgium to Katowice for the protest and to deliver a message to delegates to do more to combat climate change. He hopes that if the negotiators see \"four guys from Belgium are crazy enough to bike to the climate summit in Poland in winter, maybe that's a signal that they have to work on an ambitious climate agreement.\" Author: Jennifer Collins, Louise Osborne \n A small island in Chesapeake Bay is drowning due to erosion and rising sea levels, but most of its residents don't believe in climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     NASA scientist Peter Kalmus says small changes can make a big difference when it comes to protecting the environment. He's even written a book to inspire others. Peter Kalmus sits outside California's Pasadena City Hall in his electric car. His sons, aged 10 and 12, are on steps of the grand building, waving signs with the slogans: \"School strike for climate\" and \"Adults, act like it!\" Kalmus' Tesla is just the kind of luxury you'd expect a climate scientist at NASA's jet propulsion laboratory to have. But he doesn't exactly live a lavish lifestyle. Actually, he says, he usually cycles. He hasn't been on a plane\u00a0since 2012, and he eats a vegetarian diet. As someone who works in climate science, Kalmus feels there's no excuse not to reduce his carbon footprint. \"This is an urgent crisis,\" he says. \"Those of us who understand that should act like it's an urgent crisis.\" Read more:  'Lowering our personal carbon footprint is a question of credibility' Which is why he wrote Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution ,\u00a0a book with the message that we all have our bit to do, and lifestyle changes protect the climate don't have to be radical. Small changes add up Kalmus grows his own fruit and veg, keeps bees and used to run a car on waste vegetable oil. Other than that, his life is pretty much like that of any US American. But he has had to persuade those around him to get on board. Peter Kalmus says small changes can add to something much bigger \"I've had to shift expectations both with my extended family and also with my work,\" he explains. \"We hike more, we take more vacations locally. In California, there are lots of options for being out in nature as opposed to flying to a far-flung destination.\" Read more: Six things you can do to avert climate catastrophe By normalizing a lower-carbon lifestyle, Kalmus hopes to inspire others, even if the individual changes they make are small. \"I realized that if you try to make other people change, it doesn't usually work that well. You can't force anyone else to change. If they see you changing and smiling about it, they'll think 'that's not so bad' and they'll start to change, too.\" And small changes can add up to something much bigger, Kalmus believes. \"As more and more people start to change in their own lives it's going to have an effect on all the people around them and that's going to pave the way for collective action by shifting the culture,\" he says. Read more:\u00a0 You won't stop climate change on your own \u2014 demand action! More urgent than you think One of the challenges to getting people to shift their behavior is that climate change can seem a remote concern, so long as our lives tick by unaffected. \"Sometimes, when it's a beautiful day, it can feel like it's far away and that it's a problem just for the future,\" Kalmus says. \"But it's here now. If you don't think it's urgent, it's more urgent than you think.\" On the flip side, the urgency \u2014 and scale of the crisis \u2014 means many of us feel our individual actions won't make much difference. That's another notion Kalmus wants to challenge. Read more:\u00a0 More dire data, less climate change concern? \"There are a million things we can do,\" he says. \"When I see other people acting, that's what gives me hope. I think we're in the middle of a huge social shift, possibly a tipping point on social action on climate change.\" Hope in a new generation Last year, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg started skipping school on Fridays to strike for climate justice outside the Swedish parliament. Now, young people around the world are following her lead and making Friday a day of regular student protest. It's the kind of movement that gives Kalmus hope. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has inspired young people around the world to stand up for their future \"I don't think the social environment was ready for the school strikes,\" he says. \"There's a major shift. Things could change very rapidly from here, I think. The thing that's driving this increasing awareness is that climate change is getting worse, and that disasters are getting worse.\" Read more: \u00a0 Germany's new green youth\u00a0 Anyone deeply involved in the science of climate change will admit the future can look pretty bleak. \"It still affects me sometimes,\" Kalmus\u00a0says. \"But for me, the key thing to do is to act, and to basically do all we can and that transforms something that could lead you into despair or depression into something incredibly meaningful.\" Right now, that meaningful action is coming from his own children, as they join together with other young people across the globe to stand up for the future of their planet. You just bought a fancy lamp? Make it cooler with efficient lightbulbs. This is one of the small actions that make a difference in the long-term - and let's be honest, it's not a big effort. Some LED bulbs consume up to 90 percent less than traditional ones. In cold or rainy countries, the task might be challenging - but these challenges are nothing compared to the worst consequences of climate change. Recycling has become normal behavior for thousands of people around the world. It definitely contributes to making a better world - but unfortunately, it is not enough. Worried about your clothes shrinking in hot water? Here another reason to keep washing with cold water: Since it avoids turning on the water heater, cold-water washing also produces less greenhouse gas emissions. Until you are ready to get rid of your car completely, you could move to a hybrid electric car. But beware: The electricity that powers it is probably still coming from dirty fossil fuels. Beef production is the largest driver of tropical deforestation worldwide, with soy production closely following - mainly to feed animals. The carbon footprint of a meat-based diet is almost double that of a vegetarian one. Even reducing the amount of meat you eat makes a difference. Renewable energies are the new trend - but we are still largely dependent on fossil fuels such as coal. In countries like Germany, you can choose your energy provider - among some that draw from renewable sources. Air travel is a major challenge when it comes to tackling climate change. Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study.

{"id": null, "body": "     As part of its climate change reforms, the German government is set to alter road tax to increase costs for more pollutant cars. But environmental groups and Greens said the financial penalty was not high enough. Germany's motor vehicle tax for new high-emissions vehicles is set to rise starting 2021, the Cabinet agreed on Friday. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz pushed forth the changes, saying they would likely result in a slight increase in revenue for the state in the short term. Scholz noted that the goal was to have less high-emitting vehicles in the future and that if this was reached then \"the state will have a considerable loss of revenue.\" But the finance minister added that this would nevertheless be \"a wonderful thing.\" The motor vehicle tax increase had been agreed to last September, as part of the government's climate package between the governing CDU/CSU and SPD coalition agreement. It had not been debated until now, when it was picked up in cabinet meeting in connection with the government's coronavirus-related economic stimulus package. Read more: Will Germany use autobahn speed limits to cut carbon emissions? \u00a0 German road tax was already calculated based on a combination of engine size and emissions, but the new pricing system is designed to increase the costs for high-emissions vehicles while keeping levels for more frugal vehicles either the same or slightly reduced. The new law starts adding surcharges once cars exceed average emissions of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer (even the smallest and most frugal combustion engine cars cannot currently match this target), by adding a surcharge of \u20ac2\u00a0for each additional gram. The per-gram surcharge then increases in stages, culminating with a charge of no more than \u20ac4 per gram from 196 grams per kilometer (the emissions you'd expect from a far larger or faster car like a Ford Mustang or a BMW 7 Series).\u00a0 It would mainly affect large vehicle types such as SUVs and pick-up trucks, while smaller vehicles would be largely unaffected.\u00a0 Passenger cars with less than 95 grams of CO2 emissions will see an annual tax bonus of 30 euros for a maximum of five years. New electric cars were already exempt from the vehicle tax through the end of 2025 and this exemption has been extended until the end of 2030. Following the Cabinet decision, the law will now be considered in the Bundestag, where it could also undergo changes. Ultimately, though, given the grand coalition's large majority, the passage of this proposal or something very similar appears secure.

But the automobile associations responded favorably to the law. The German Association of the Automotive Industry said it welcomed the reform as \"a fair compromise that has demanded concessions from all parties involved and steers the motor vehicle tax in the right direction.\" The automobile association ADAC\u00a0also approved of the law, calling it a \"reasonable compromise between incentives for more climate protection and affordable mobility.\" jcg/msh (AFP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

{"id": null, "body": "     Did you know it's possible to take legal action to fight global warming? European citizens have been doing just that. And now, youths in the US won the right to sue their government over failed climate action as well. Last week, a group of American youths officially won the right to sue the United States government for failing to curb climate change. The US is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, after China. The 21 plaintiffs, who are between 9 and 20 years old, and come from all over the US, filed the climate change lawsuit together with climate scientist Dr. James Hansen in 2015. In the lawsuit, they accuse the federal government of\u00a0violating the younger generations' constitutional rights to life and liberty by declining to take action against global warming. They argue that the government is failing\u00a0to protect essential public trust resources like air and water, which\u00a0are vital to survival.\u00a0 The\u00a0 November 11\u00a0 ruling \u00a0in Oregon district court\u00a0upheld their main argument, that\u00a0\"the government has known for more than 50 years that the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels was destabilizing the climate system in a way that would significantly endanger plaintiffs, with the damage persisting for millennia.\"\u00a0 Yet, the court case\u00a0argues,\u00a0the government has failed to take action, making it responsible for some of the harm caused by climate change. Young generation most affected One of the plaintiffs, 19-year-old student Tia Hatton, told DW that the group is suing the government because \"the government has known about climate change and the effects of carbon dioxide pollution on the stable climate system, but failed to take action.\" \"We are all very worried about our future, health and safety from the climate change impacts that we're seeing already, and that will worsen as time goes on,\" Hatton said. \"We are going to be affected the most by it,\"\u00a0Hatton believes. All the kids and teenagers in the plaintiff group have been personally impacted by climate change. Some of them live on farms being affected by drought, while others have lost their homes due to floods. Others, like Hatton, are affected by dry conditions caused by forest fires , which have aggravated her asthma. \"Our role as plaintiffs is to show them the personal harm climate change is causing. We represent the children - not just of this nation, but of the entire world.\" Holding leaders accountable \"Right now is the time to act. We have science in front of us. We can no longer put profit above the safety and health of our children,\" Hatton says The lawsuit has been called a landmark,\u00a0and has been the target of\u00a0strong opposition from lobbying groups, such as the largest fossil fuel trade association -\u00a0the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (API) -\u00a0which spends million of dollars each year on lobbying to promote the interests of oil, gas and coal companies.\u00a0 Further opposition has come from the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, and the US government, which all submitted motions for the case to be thrown out. But their motion was rejected, and the lawsuit was ruled valid by\u00a0US district Judge Ann Aiken. She wrote in her ruling:\u00a0\"This lawsuit may be groundbreaking, but the fact does not alter the legal standards governing the motions to dismiss. (...) Federal courts too often have been cautious and overly deferential in the arena of environment law, and the world has suffered for it.\" The case will\u00a0now officially go\u00a0to trial. And that's exactly what the group of young plaintiffs sought to achieve. \"When we are in the courtroom, we're sitting right next to the government and the fossil fuel lawyers. And you just want them to look you in the eye and acknowledge that you have a right to a healthy and stable future,\"\u00a0Hattan said. European\u00a0cases set precedent This is not the first climate action case against a government. In 2015, a Dutch court ordered the government to cut greenhouse gas emissions nationwide by 25 percent by the year of 2020 after the organization Urgenda took the government to court on behalf of 900 Dutch citizens. \"The state must do more to avert the imminent danger caused by climate change, also in view of its duty of care to protect and improve the living environment,\" the verdict\u00a0read . It was the first time citizens sued their government over climate change and won. This laid\u00a0the foundations for similar cases around the world. It inspired Belgian activist Ignace Schops and a group of artists, filmmakers and rock stars to do the same, and sue the Belgian government to increase\u00a0its climate change game, and make deeper greenhouse gas emission cuts. After all, Dutch and Belgian governments signed the Paris Agreement that emerged from the COP21 climate summit in 2015,\u00a0aiming to keep global warming below maximum 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). In the case of\u00a0Belgium, the country would need to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020, and around 90 percent by 2050. Schops is seeking to hold the government accountable, calling for a 40 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020. In his opinion, a court case is the perfect way to achieve this goal.\u00a0 \"When you look at big changes in the world, like the ban on smoking and asbestos, the big changes happened when a court case came in,\"\u00a0Schops told DW. \"So we started a court case out of love for the planet.\" A hearing is expected within the next few months. How-to for you If you want to do the same in your country, here's Schops' advice: find a creative group of well-known people who can raise awareness around\u00a0the cause; set up a petition to gather citizen support; and start a crowd-funding campaign to pay for legal fees. Now\u00a0you're good to go - which country will bring the next legal challenge? We wish this were more funny but it's just sad. Even if we somehow manage to stay within the now-ambitious global warming limit of 2\u00b0C on global mean temperature compared to the pre-industrial age, sea levels will still rise by more than a meter and sink Amsterdam. Continuing to emit carbon at our current rate means we will have a 4\u00b0C increase by 2100, leaving New York under water. Sure, we all want to snorkel Australia's Great Barrier Reef and take selfies with Nemo. But better be quick - climate change is destroying coral reefs: Rising water temperatures can cause bleaching of coral and, at 2\u00b0C of warming, coral can simply dissolve. Increased oceanic CO2 uptake makes the water more acidic, preventing new coral from normal growth. With warming in the area at \"three times the global average,\" according to the OECD, Europe's Alps have already seen major declines in annual snow levels. Ski areas in lower regions are already having difficulty or going bankrupt. Some resorts are even covering glaciers with reflective material during warmer months, with glaciers melting and plant growth migrating to higher elevations. Venice is just one of many low-lying cities that could drown in the rising seas, or become uninhabitable as flooding and storms affect them more strongly. But it is not only the Italian island-city expecting this fate. Cities all over the world - Miami, New York, Santo Domingo, Baranquilla, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Palembang, Tokyo, Mumbai, Alexandria, Amsterdam - are equally at risk. Melting ice is giving ships a shortcut between Europe and Asia on the historically impassable Northwest Passage. In 2007, the European Space Agency announced that the whole passage was \"fully navigable\" and while it's not clear enough to be used as a shipping lane, cruise ships are capitalizing on what used to be an adventure reserved for the toughest explorers. Always wanted to go on a safari? Well, better be quick. Overpopulation and climate change are both affecting animals as they struggle to adjust to more frequent and more intense droughts, heat waves, storms and rising oceans. World Wildlife Fund (WWF) put the African Elephant on its \"Impacted Species and Places\" list, along with sea turtles, tigers, dolphins and whales. Climate change is helping propel the Golden State to severe droughts, with the last three years being the hottest and driest on record - harming the almond yields. So, if you plan to wander underneath Californian almond trees - or through Brazilian coffee plantations or Vietnamese rice fields - the time to do that may be limited. The World Heritage Sites lists many natural beauties, but with 3\u00b0C of warming, 136 of the 700 sites will be affected by climate change. One of them is the Glacier National Park, a crucial site for research on climate change, proving its effect: of 150 glaciers that are estimated to have existed here in mid-19th century, only 24 remained in 2010. The park is predicted to be glacier free by 2030. Fear not, if wanderlust hasn't got hold of you yet, why not stay right where you are? Climate change may well be coming to your door. If you're lucky, you won't even have to leave your sofa to witness it. Climate Central estimates that 150+ million people are living in areas that will either be submerged or experience chronic flooding by 2100. It may also happen a lot faster.

The Climate Change Performance Index published today shows which industrial countries are in the lead, and which are the biggest losers. A ranking of the world's most emission-intensive economies indicates who is working hardest to protect the climate. But the biggest takeaway from the new study is that there are no gold medals to be given out for in the race to cut emissions; not as long as the competitors universally fail to match the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global heating well below 2 degrees. Scientists agree that by the end of this century, our planet will be at least three degrees hotter than it was before the industrial revolution -- unless we can drastically, and rapidly, cut manmade CO2 output .

Together, these nations are responsible for over 90% of global greenhouse gas emissions. They were ranked on four areas: Greenhouse gas emissions, share of energy generated by renewables, energy consumption per capita, and current and climate policy. With no country deemed worthy of gold, silver or bronze, Sweden took fourth place. The Nordic country scored well on policy, with its target of a 100% renewable energy supply by 2040, and the world's highest carbon tax at 114 euros per metric ton. By comparison, Germany is planning to introduce a tax of 10 euros on a ton of carbon \u00a0in 2021. Behind Sweden, Denmark and Morocco came in fifth and sixth. Germany lagged behind in 23rd place. Europe's biggest climate loser, meanwhile, was Poland, in 50th place. China climbed the rankings compared to last year, but is still in the bottom half of the table, in 30th place. If there was a second division for climate action, the United States would be relegated before its feet touched the ground. Already way down the league in 2018, this year it hit the very bottom of the table. \"Climate policy there is going backward,\" H\u00f6hne said. Under President Donald Trump, many environmental regulations have been scrapped and the country is set to pull out of the Paris Agreement next year. The US also uses more than twice as much energy per person as the EU, and 10 times more than India. \"That is not a good situation,\" H\u00f6hne said. A soft turn in the right direction Overall emissions were falling in more than half the states ranked, \"particularly the smaller-industrial and developing countries,\" Ursula Hagen, another of the report's authors, told DW. \"That's a positive aspect and gives up hope of a turnaround.\" \"We see subtle moves in the right direction,\"H\u00f6hne said. But the world's biggest industrial nations, the G20, \"are unfortunately still performing really poorly. More than half the G20 are in the bottom half of the index.\" Read more :\u00a0 COP25: 200 countries pledge 'green revolution' Just behind its Nordic neighbor, runner up Denmark is a small country that scored big on climate policy. It aims to cut 70% of its CO2 emissions by 2030, by which time it plans to have phased out coal. Morocco also impressed the researchers. As early as 2015, it became one of the few countries worldwide to begin cutting subsidies to fossil energy providers, the study says. It also gained points for low energy use and development of renewable energy, which is earmarked to supply 52% of demand by 2030. From India to Brazil This year, India ranked in the top 10 for the first time, getting high marks for comparatively low per capita energy use and -- unlike the US and Europe -- low greenhouse gas emissions. India has also invested heavily in renewables, which should provide 40% of its energy by 2030. \"I find that extremely impressive for a country at that level of development,\u201d H\u00f6hne said.\" India was praised for its plans to expand its network of renwables Brazil was criticized for deforestation rates in the Amazon rainforest Points were taken off, however, for India's plans to build new coal-fired power plants to meet some of the rest of its growing energy demand. \"As far as I'm concerned, the international community is responsible for helping India to prevent this and shift to alternative energy sources instead,\" H\u00f6hne added. With more than 70% of power coming from hydro, Brazil was world leader in this area. However, it ranked in the bottom 10 for climate policy.\u00a0 \"Experts are concerned about deforestation rates, the highest in the last decade, and extensive forest fires in the Amazon, while the government under president Bolsonaro cut the environment agency budget for fire prevention,\" the report says. And the researchers could see no significant plans to cut Brazil's long-term emissions. Europe and German need to get serious The report welcomed the new European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen's calls for the EU to raise 2030 emissions reduction targets from 40% to 55%. \"These targets are the reason we have given the EU a good rating on climate policy,\" Ursula Hagen said. \"As with the goal of being climate-neutral by 2050, this must now be filled out with concrete measures. So far there is little to no actual strategy.\" Read more: \u00a0 UN chief: Climate change near 'point of no return' At present, the EU is not on track to reach the Paris climate targets. Neither is Germany, whose climate policy Hagen describes as \"lackluster\" and \"incompatible\" with the Paris Agreement. H\u00f6hne described the country's recently adopted climate policy package as \"a step in the right direction, but far too small,\" adding that the country needed \"a clear commitment to climate neutrality.\" Until then, it will languish in the middle of the index, a long way from taking one of the empty spots on the winner's podium. Young activists in Berlin took a dip in the city's Spree River to demonstrate their desire for more action on climate change. Their protest took place as Germany's upper house of parliament passed a raft of measures aimed at cutting emissions. However, critics of the package said it did not go far enough. Thousands of protesters gathered in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to voice dissatisfaction with a perceived lack of urgency on the part of the government. Some 50,000 people took part, demanding a \"new start\" for the government's climate policy. \"The climate is changing, why aren't we?\" ask these protesters Rome. The historic Italian city of Venice was recently flooded, with the local mayor blaming climate change for the highest tide in 50 years. Climate protests took place in 138 Italian towns and cities, according to Fridays for Future Italia, including in major urban centers like Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples and Palermo. Activists and schoolchildren in Sydney kicked off the latest round of global protests against climate change on Friday by picketing the headquarters of Australia's ruling party. The protesters \u2014 brandishing placards that read \"You're burning our future\" and chanting \"we will rise\" \u2014 turned out as Sydney was again enveloped in toxic smoke caused by bushfires. The protests have taken on extra urgency in Australia \u2014 the country's southeast has been devastated by hundreds of damaging bushfires in recent weeks. Wildfires and drought have left the koala bear on the verge of \"functional\" extinction. Hundreds of people marched through Tokyo's Shinjuku district to show their support for the Fridays For Future movement. Japan is no exception to abnormal weather patterns around the world in recent years. The island nation has been hit by increasingly frequent typhoons, and also by hotter weather. In October, Typhoon Hagibis ripped through central and north-eastern Japan, killing scores of people. Demonstrations also took place in Indonesia, where \u2013 in an effort to to protect tropical forests - the government has issued a temporary ban on permits for palm plantations. However, critics say a lack of transparency has made it difficult to evaluate the moratorium's effectiveness. The global palm oil trade has been blamed as a major contributor to climate change by causing loss of vegetation. In Delhi \u2014 the world's most polluted capital \u2014 students staged a march to the environment ministry carrying placards and demanding that the government declare a climate emergency. The country is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gases and has 14 of the 15 most polluted cities in the world, according to a UN study. The protests took place as negotiators from some 200 countries prepared to meet for the COP25 climate conference in Madrid. Participants are seeking clearer rules on how to meet the requirements of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change. The accord aims to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

{"id": null, "body": "     A new report says that roughly 75% of the 184 national pledges to cut emissions under the Paris Agreement are insufficient to avoid dire global warming. But local and private sector initiatives could offer hope. Scientists are warning that\u00a0climate change could soon reach a point of no return. And while the timing of this\u00a0tipping point remains a source of disagreement\u00a0 in the scientific community, there is a consensus about the best way to prevent it: Rapidly cut global greenhouse emissions (GHG).\u00a0 But the primary vehicle to achieve emission\u00a0reductions, the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement , which aims to\u00a0keep warming below 2 C\u00a0above pre-industrial levels \u2014 and preferably to limit temperature increase even further to 1.5 Celsius \u2014\u00a0is proving to be woefully inadequate. According to a new report by the Universal Ecological Fund (UEF), around 75% of 184 Paris Agreement pledges have been judged insufficient to slow climate change. Worse still, some these pledges are not even being implemented. \u00a0 Read more :\u00a0\u00a0 IPCC report: The world gets hungrier, but the land is exhausted 'Far too little, too late' The UEF\u00a0report is timed to coincide with the upcoming COP climate summit (to take place in Madrid after host Chile cancelled ) where signatories to the Paris agreement can make new\u00a0pledges with steeper emission cuts. Since the Paris accord was ratified in 2016, only six countries have actually\u00a0reviewed their\u00a0pledges, with\u00a0four upping\u00a0their cuts and\u00a0two\u00a0weakening\u00a0their pledges. \"Other than a handful of the pledges, namely the European Union and seven other countries, the pledges are quite inadequate,\" Sir Robert Watson, former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and co-author of the report, told DW. According to Watson, the pledges won't keep temperatures from rising by 2 Celsius, much\u00a0less the more ambitious target of 1.5 Celsius. \"Simply, the pledges are far too little, too late,\" he added. \"We wanted to push for much stronger pledges as soon as possible.\" Also on Tuesday, a paper published in Bioscience Magazine involving\u00a0more than 11,000 scientists from 153 countries declared a climate emergency that could bring \"untold suffering\" unless urgent action was\u00a0taken. Then Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki Moon (2-L) and French President Francois Hollande (r) were among those hailing the signing of the historic Paris climate agreement in 2015. But pledges are falling well short to meet targets. Chance to stay below 2 C already lost? This isn't the first time that the failures of the so-called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that are at the heart of the Paris Agreement have been highlighted. A landmark September \"United in Science\" report \u00a0that synthesizes climate research by major partner organizations including\u00a0UN Environment, the Global Carbon Project and\u00a0the IPCC,\u00a0said that the Paris pledges need to be tripled to avert catastrophic warming.\u00a0 If implemented, current pledges will achieve closer to 3 C warming at the end of this century, Pep Canadell, Executive Director Global Carbon Project and a report co-author, told DW of the Paris\u00a0targets.\u00a0 More concerning perhaps, he believes the chance to limit warming below 1.5 C has already passed and that unless we reach peak emissions before 2030,\u00a0\"the chances to stay below 2 C will be also largely lost.\" Read more : Eco-friendly Paris: paving the way towards a greener future One problem, according to the UEF report, is that emerging economies China and India, who are\u00a0among the world's biggest GHG emitters, have only\u00a0pledged\u00a0to reduce their emissions \"intensity\" relative to GDP by 2030.\u00a0Ongoing economic growth\u00a0will\u00a0cause their emissions to increase in the coming decades, meaning these huge polluters have a long way to go to meet the Paris\u00a0targets.\u00a0 One rare ray of hope\u00a0is the 28 Member State EU, which is\u00a0expected to cut GHG emissions by 58% below 1990 levels by 2030. Zero emissions Part of the problem with the Paris pledges, according to Dr Niklas H\u00f6hne, a founding partner of the Germany-based NewClimate Institute, is\u00a0that such\u00a0non-binding \"bottom-up\" commitments\u00a0are\u00a0not consistent with\u00a0the\u00a0broader goals. As an antidote, he says that nations need to immediately set a timetable to reach and sustain net\u2010zero CO2 emissions. \"It's no longer\u00a0about small pledges,\" H\u00f6hne said of a net\u2010zero CO2 emissions policy that the UK Labour Party has already committed to by 2030, as have Democratic Party sponsors of the Green New Deal in the US. Watson agrees that net zero emissions needs to be the target by 2050, which would mean electricity, at the least, should be 100% renewable.\u00a0\u00a0 How will US withdrawal impact targets? The US, historically the world's biggest GHG emitter, has complicated matters\u00a0when President Donald Trump's administration this week confirmed\u00a0its\u00a0 withdrawal from the Paris Agreement .\u00a0Combined with Trump's rollbacks of major federal climate regulations, the Obama Administration-made pledge to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2025 will now likely not be met. \"We definitely regard this as a dangerous decision,\" said Sven Harmeling, a climate expert at CARE, a Holland-based NGO helping vulnerable communities adapt to the climate crisis,\u00a0in response to the US withdrawal.\u00a0\"We call on other countries, but also stakeholders in the US, whether cities, whether business , to not get distracted by the isolating step of the US administration but to step up the fight against climate change,\" he told DW. Offsetting failed national pledges Watson sees potential to meet\u00a0the Paris\u00a0targets\u00a0with or without Trump as state governments and private industry set their own decarbonization targets: \"There are some sparks of hope that even in the US, in the absence of leadership from the administration and from Congress, some of the US states and industries are trying to go to low carbon,\" said Watson. California, for example \u2014\u00a0which would be the 5th largest economy in the world in terms of GDP \u2014\u00a0has set itself a net zero emissions target \u00a0by 2045. \"That is a huge step forward and a very encouraging signal,\" said H\u00f6hne. Read more :\u00a0 Climate action made in America \u2014 despite Trump Indeed, the Trump administration's Paris exit\u00a0and climate policy roll back has not stopped the fast decline of coal-fired power and the rise of cheap renewables, according to a Climate Action Tracker (CAT)\u00a0 report \u00a0released this month. US emissions in 2030 are expected to be 4% lower than projected when Trump came to power, representing an overall \u2014 yet inadequate \u2014 cut of 13% below 2005 levels, according to the CAT report. But pushed by the Fridays for Future \u00a0and climate emergency movements, national governments also need to foster this low-carbon transition. \"We need both,\" Watson said. Estimates are already showing that over 1 million people took to the street on Friday in Italy to protest for the climate. There were 250,000 in Rome, 80,000 in Naples, 20,000 in Bologna and 20,000 in Turin, pictured here. In Palermo, the riot police had to intervene after 30 black-clad youngsters attempted to break up the demonstration. Despite the Russian government's opposition to organized climate strikes, some protesters gathered in defiance. This girl holds a poster as part of a Greenpeace flash mob in front of the Russian government building. Arshak Makichyan, 25, became the face of the Russian Friday for Future movement with his lone protest. An estimated 6,000 protesters took to the streets in The Hague last week, and it is estimated that similar numbers can be expected this Friday. The Fridays for Future movement has been extremely popular in the Netherlands. Over a million people have been reported as protesting in Italy, with 20,000 in the city of Turin. Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti urged teachers not to punish students who skipped class. A protester blocks the street in Lausanne, Switzerland to stop police vehicles from getting through. The Fridays for Future movement in Switzerland has been relatively small compared to other European countries. In Berlin, where an estimated 100,000 people came to the streets last week, the protests have taken on a major political dimension. Huge puppets of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz exemplified general dissatisfaction with how politicians have dealt with climate change issues and a national climate plan the government released last week. Where Greta Thunberg first began the climate protest by herself over a year ago, thousands of protesters took to the street on Friday. Thunberg, who addressed the UN this week, will soon make her way to South America for a UN climate conference. Protesters in Israel donned red as they took to the streets. Following Israel's indecisive elections last week, many young Israelis remain concerned about the future of climate change policy in their country.

{"id": null, "body": "     While climate change is growing in the public consciousness, migration is still the major issue for more EU citizens, according to the results of the European Commission's biannual Eurobarometer public opinion survey. Migration remains the top concern across the European Union, according to an EU public opinion poll, although the importance of climate change is growing. Thirty-four percent of respondents in the\u00a0new\u00a0Eurobarometer survey view immigration as the most pressing problem, down six percentage points from last year. However, the issue topped the list of issues in 21 member states, with\u00a0Malta, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and the Netherlands having the highest proportion of respondents ranking it most problematic. For the first time,\u00a0 climate change jumped to the second most important concern, with 22% of respondents mentioning it, according to the biannual poll conducted by the European Commission. Denmark was the country most consumed with climate change, followed by its northern neighbors Sweden and Finland. The economy, member states' public finances and terrorism tied for third at 18% in the survey, followed by the environment at 13%. Trust in EU Trust in EU institutions reached its highest level since 2014 and is higher than in member states' individual parliaments and governments. Forty-four percent of respondents said they trust the EU, compared to 34% who said they trust their national parliament or government. Similarly, 45% of respondents view the EU as positive, while 61% are optimistic about the future of the bloc and 55% are satisfied with the way democracy works in Brussels. Ahead of elections for the European Parliament, there's much talk of \"European values.\" But what does that really mean? If Europe were 100 people, what would they agree on? On what would they disagree? With thousands of participants from all over Europe, the \"European Values Study\" found, for example, that 29 respondents out of 100 think that men generally make better political leaders than women. Respondents overwhelmingly oppose political violence and the accepting of bribes. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being never, three quarters checked 1. This first data release from the 2017 \"European Values Study\" covers responses from 14 countries: Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Iceland, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Over half of respondents think governments should be able to use cameras to surveil public spaces. Nearly half say that shouldn't be allowed. People in all countries are relatively split on this; there are only slight differences: Poland, Slovenia and Croatia, for example, are more vehemently against video surveillance, but even some of their immediate neighbors view surveillance more favorably. Only 38 respondents in 100 say they believe in heaven. Of those 38, 33 are religious \u2014 curiously, the remainder are atheists or don't consider themselves religious at all. Either way, heaven still seems to be more popular than hell: Only 29 out of 100 Europeans believe that hell exists. Respondents also don't agree on whether same-sex couples can parent as well as mixed-sex couples do. In Iceland, 88 of 100 people believe that they can, while only 10% of respondents do in Russia. Social science research, however, overwhelmingly concludes that children of same-sex parents are not worse off than those with heterosexual parents. Few respondents had a problem with having Christians as neighbors. However, more than a quarter of respondents said they would mind having immigrants as neighbors. The same goes for Muslims, which makes them the religious group that respondents had the most reservations about living next to. That's compared with 12 out of 100 for Jews and just five out of 100 for Christians. All of this information comes from the \"European Values Study\", in which researchers ask Europeans several hundred questions every 10 years to figure out their attitudes about diversity, inclusion, politics and more. The newest survey started in 2017. Sixteen countries have already reported their data, covering almost 20,000 respondents, and 10 more countries have finished the fieldwork.

{"id": null, "body": "     Persistent droughts have forced Masai cattle herds to the brink of starvation. For these legendary warriors, the next battle means combatting climate change through education and adaptation. Kenia Massai mit Viehherde Deep in the heart of Amboseli National Park, on the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro, men and women gather beneath the canopy, in a large forest clearing. They are the Masai and they travelled here form across the region for the annual Enkang oo-nkiri ceremony - or meat eating ceremony. They wear distinctive Masai beading; their hair and bodies are decorated with a red earthy pigment, ochre. The women wear large beaded discs around their necks. In the middle of this festive gathering, a Masai elder - Ole Ntimama - meanders between the young warriors. He has distended earlobes, long braided black hair and a red Masai blanket draped over his upper body. He lines up the young men who have been chosen to kill the ceremonial bull. This event grants young warriors the right to eat meat in the presence of women - but the honor is becoming less and less tangible, as the Masai must shift their traditions away from meat, simply to survive. Young warriors celebrate the right to eat meat in the presence of women - but climate change is turning meat into a rarity According to the Masai, God - or Enkai - made them the custodians of the world's cattle. But Ole Ntimama says changing weather has made this job harder than ever before. \"The cows I have lost to drought compared to the cows I have sold are far too many,\" said Ole Ntimama. \"It's a normal sight to see dead cows littering the landscape in these tough times.\"  Catastrophic changes The rainy season has become short and unpredictable. Grass doesn't have time to grow before the next drought comes, which means the cattle have nothing to eat. Some Masai herdsmen end up walking for weeks to find pastures for their cattle. Others slaughter their herds or sell off their ancestral land, in order feed the families. Ole Ntimama blames the changing climate. He said it has been a catastrophe not only for the Masai but for the land. \"The cows at times do not produce a lot of milk because of water shortages caused by severe droughts, which claim their lives,\" Ntimama said. \"The grass is also not sufficient for all our animals, and we keep many animals. Water is becoming so hard to find, and in some places grass has completely stopped growing.\" Often, Masai must sell livestock below value or slaughter them just to survive The Masai are pastoralists - they live from a diet based on milk, blood from their cows and meat. But lack of rains has left their animals too weak to produce milk. So the Masai are starting to eat porridge made from cereals that they have to buy. Climate change is threatening their entire way of life. \"Meat is no longer our staple food,\" Ole Ntimama said. \"We now need money to buy food when droughts occur and only use the cows strictly for milk.\"  Learning to adapt Beatrice Lukelesia is a program officer from Masai Women for Education & Environment Betterment. She says everyone here is feeling the effects of climate change - including the women. \"Their husbands go in search of better pastures and water for their animals,\" Lukelesia said. \"The animals are the only source of food, and they go with the men. Climate change contributes to the feminization of poverty among the Masai.\" Women remain in the villages while men herd livestock to pastures - which are becoming harder to find With their knowledge of resource management handed down through the generations, the Masai are considered natural custodians of the land. But the rains have degraded their quality of life significantly. \"The Masai used to be a wealthy tribe with individuals owning over 500 cows each,\" Lukelesia said. \"The severe droughts have reduced these numbers drastically.\" Beatrice Lukelesia and her colleagues work in Masai villages, teaching them skills to help them cope with climate change. They have taught Masai women how to convert cow dung into biofuel, so they can be self-sufficient and they aren't dependent on logging for fuel. Ole Ntimama says that learning new coping methods is vital to the Masai's survival, even if it means abandoning tradition. \"We just need to adapt to survive,\" Ole Ntimama said. \"The best way I have found to cope with this is to sell my animals just before the drought strikes. Then I am able to feed my family. It doesn't matter if I have sold them at a loss.\"  Help from Kenya? Lukelesia hopes Kenya's new constitution, which was signed into law three years ago, will help protect both the Masai and the land. The constitution calls for an equitable division of natural resources and a reduction in greenhouse gas production. \"The Masai have been educated on ways to cope with the erratic weather changes,\" Lukelesia said. \"They now practice village land use plans that include zones for grazing so their animals have enough feed, and they have also started practicing farming and rain catchment.\" Despite the challenges, Lukelesia said the Masai are strong warriors, who will survive this latest challenge to their existence. She says their role as guardians, protecting the wild land and the forests is vital. \"The Masai were known as fierce warriors who even successfully defied colonization,\" Lukelesia said. \"Nobody can attack the forest knowing such a people patrol the forest to prevent poaching or logging.\" Africa is increasingly promoting research and innovation to combat climate change. The most efficient green innovations are those that take the continent's economic needs into account, a leading African researcher says.

{"id": null, "body": "     Political leaders from 64 countries and the European Union have committed to stronger environmental protections after a UN report found the world has failed to meet any of its biodiversity targets. Leaders from across the world have promised to turn environmental degradation around and put nature on the path to recovery within a decade. \u00a0 \"We are in a state of planetary emergency,\" the 65 leaders, who include German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, wrote ahead of a UN biodiversity summit on Wednesday. \"We commit ourselves not simply to words, but to meaningful action and mutual accountability.\" \u00a0 The commitments, which come two days before a UN\u00a0biodiversity summit in New York,\u00a0include eliminating plastic leakage to the oceans by 2050 and incentivizing banks and businesses to value the natural world. The leaders identify unsustainable production and consumption as a key driver of environmental crises that \"require urgent and immediate global action.\" \u00a0 But strongmen leading some of the world's biggest polluters \u2014 US, China, India, Russia and Brazil \u2014 are not among the signatories.\u00a0 Missed targets The pledge follows the September publication of a landmark assessment of biodiversity which showed humanity had failed to fully achieve\u00a0any of the 20 global biodiversity targets set by the UN ten years ago. Just six of them had been \"partly achieved\", the report said. For one goal, on protecting coral reefs , the world was found to be\u00a0moving in the opposite direction. An oil spill in Mauritius in July is threatening coral reefs and other areas of rich biodiversity Indigenous people in Brazil blocked a highway in August that has enabled deforestation of the Amazon rainforest Data from individual governments shows\u00a0that a third of national biodiversity targets, which are set by the countries themselves, are on track to be met or exceeded. But these are less ambitious than the UN targets and less than a quarter match up well with the global goals to protect nature. The vision for biodiversity set out in 2010 is only achievable if the world responds to \"compelling evidence\" that \"transformative change\" is required, said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity, which prepared the Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO) report. The charge sheet is long. Pollution from plastics and pesticides have not been brought down to safe levels. Governments still subsidize businesses that damage ecosystems . Coral reefs, which are dying across the world, are struck by the triple-threat of human action: climate change, pollution and overfishing. Some of those drivers are getting worse. Fish populations are recovering in waters managed by sustainable fishing policies More than 3 billion people rely on fish for 20% of their daily protein intake And even where there is progress, it is rarely enough. Deforestation should have been halted by now, but\u00a0has only been cut by a third, with Asia and Europe gaining forests while Africa and South America lose them at a faster rate. Conservation efforts have saved species like the Puerto Rican amazon parrot and the Mongolian Przewalski's horse. But they have failed to keep others like the Western Black Rhino or the Christmas Island pipistrelle from being wiped out forever. While the big trends in biodiversity loss were already known, the UN report included \"systematic analysis\" on how well the world has achieved the 2010 targets, said Josef Settele, an ecologist at the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany, who contributed research to the report but was not involved in writing it.\u00a0 \"There is also some brightness,\" Settele added. \"The things we are doing are not completely in vain.\" For instance, almost 100 countries have incorporated biodiversity values into national accounting systems. Over the last 20 years, the world has increased the share of protected areas from 10% to 15% on land and from 3% to 7% in water. There are now more fish in waters managed by good fishing policies. Governments are increasingly eradicating invasive species from islands. And since 1993, conservation actions have prevented the extinction\u00a0of between 28 and 48 bird and mammal species, according to a study published this month in the journal Conservation Letters \u2014 though many remain highly threatened and may still become extinct. \"The progress toward conserving life on earth has been much greater than it would have been [without action],\" said Thomas Brooks, chief scientist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, who was a co-author of the Conservation Letters study but was not involved in the GBO. \"The absolutely key question is how to scale up from where things currently are, in terms of responses, to meet targets comprehensively.\" Bee populations are falling because of intensive farming, pesticides, pollution and climate change Damage to ecosystems puts food security at risk The way to get that scale, according to the GBO report, is by \"mainstreaming\" the opportunities and responsibilities from protecting nature. That means every level of society \u2014 from individuals and local communities to businesses and national governments \u2014 would need to factor biodiversity into their economic decisions. Like climate change, ecological collapse is happening at breakneck speed. A 2019 report by IPBES, the UN panel of biodiversity experts, found that humans are altering the natural world at an \"unprecedented pace\" and threatening 1 million animal and plant species with extinction. Scientists say both issues require systemic changes, but individual actions can help. Agriculture is one of the greatest drivers of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. A study published in the journal Nature this month found that more than two-thirds\u00a0of future biodiversity losses could be avoided by conserving and restoring land, reducing food waste and switching to more plant-based diets. They are among many actions laid out in the GBO report to reduce and eventually restore lost biodiversity. If we do not act faster, said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Program, \"biodiversity will continue to buckle\" under the weight of overexploitation, climate change, pollution, invasive alien species and changes to land and sea. \"This will further damage human health, economies and societies \u2014\u00a0with particularly detrimental effects on indigenous peoples and local communities.\" This is an updated version of an earlier article. Why do we find it so hard to change our behavior? German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk explains how this is connected to the climate crisis.\n\u00a0 A UN-backed report says a million species are at risk of extinction, and warns biodiversity loss and failure to conserve ecosystems has catastrophic effects on people as well as nature. \n\u00a0 While endangered species such as the spiny seahorse have started to recolonize former habitats due to coronavirus lockdowns, a new study confirms that the number of extinction-threatened species is rising fast. \n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Countries pledge to reverse destruction of nature after missing biodiversity targets", "article_name": "global-biodiversity-outlook-targets-extinction-summit-new-york-pledge", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/global-biodiversity-outlook-targets-extinction-summit-new-york-pledge/a-54932895", "date_published": "2020-09-28 00:00:00", "article_length": 7175, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:48.179360"}
{"id": null, "body": "     There was a time when weather presenters were all about rain, sunshine and areas of high pressure. Now the climate is changing, so are their jobs. Many see it as their role to help raise awareness. Though it was a couple of years ago, weathercaster Anju Singh clearly recollects the message she delivered to camera\u00a0when unexpected heavy rains started pounding and destroying crops in parts of India. \"We convinced farmers to do water harvesting, so\u00a0at least water was not wasted and could be used later when there is scarcity,\"\u00a0Singh told DW. \"Because the pattern has totally changed.\" As has the job of a weather forecaster. When she\u00a0started out almost 15 years ago, \"the role of weather presenters was just to talk about the weather forecast,\" Singh said.\u00a0\"But now they are educators and a kind of bridge between (the) masses and the scientists.\" \u00a0 She is a senior presenter at DD Kisan, the agriculture television channel with\u00a0India's public service broadcaster Doordarshan. She's also\u00a0a member of Climate without Borders, \u00a0a global network of weather presenters from more than 100 countries pushing to include more climate change talks in their daily work. Kenyena Mollen, another member and weather presenter at the Uganda Broadcasting Corporation \u00a0(pictured above) says there is plenty of work to be done. \"We've seen there have been extreme events that weren't there in the past,\" she told DW. \"Yet the public is\u00a0not aware of such information.\"\u00a0\u00a0 That's where people like her and Singh can make a difference. \"TV meteorologists are unique in that they have an ongoing conversation with the public,\" Bernadette Woods, Emmy Award-winning meteorologist and director of Climate Central's Climate Matters program, told DW. \"In many cases, they're the only scientists\u00a0the public ever sees.\" Climate Matters provides tools that enable meteorologists and journalists to better inform the public about the impacts of global warming. In 2017, they partnered with the World Meteorological Organization in a campaign to engage weather presenters and climate communicators. Farmers as the target group While for many people around the world,\u00a0weather watching might be about deciding on how to dress or what to do on a given day, for those living\u00a0from the land, forecasting can make\u00a0the difference between saving the crop by harvesting earlier than planned or letting the rain spoil\u00a0it.\u00a0 Nonetheless, in\u00a0India, where agriculture employs almost 60 percent \u00a0of the country's workers, Singh says convincing farmers\u00a0about the perils of global warming is hard work. The most effective way, she adds, is to alert them to correlations. Burning crop residues, for instance, leads to heat accumulation in the atmosphere and produces\u00a0 polluting smoke that may affect farmers' health. \"We have to think of smarter ways of communicating and convincing people,\" Singh said. Woods agrees: \"We've got this big global issue, but we feel it locally. So when you can make that connection, it's pretty powerful.\" More time, more science Extreme weather events, which Woods says are how most people now experience climate change, can\u00a0help weather forescasters raise\u00a0the issue.\u00a0 \"We know that climate change is changing our weather and that gives the\u00a0opportunity for the TV meteorologists to make those connections for their public,\" Woods said. \"For example, when there's a heavy rain event or when heat is breaking records, they can really tie that to climate science.\" In the case of heat waves, for example, the link with climate change is usually relatively easy to explain. But as Friederike Otto, acting director of Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, explains,\u00a0most extreme weather events respond to a much more complex combination of factors. And that makes the job trickier. \"It's a challenge\u00a0to provide accurate climate change\u00a0information that is\u00a0visually appealing, and that you can talk about in five minutes or less,\"\u00a0Otto said.\u00a0 As far as she's concerned, an\u00a0ideal\u00a0weather forecast\u00a0would not offer pure facts, but\u00a0bring science closer to the public. At the same time, providing the audience with a\u00a0solid scientific basis would enable\u00a0them to correctly interpret the facts and figures related to weather and climate change.\u00a0 Climate change can play a role in extreme weather events, but it's often not the only cause Mollen is no stranger to the reality of short airtime, and would also like weather forecasters to\u00a0receive financial freedom to spread the message in person among the country's less privileged.\u00a0 \"As weather presenters we should be able to go out\u00a0in the field and reach out to people unable to watch TV or even unable listen to radio,\" she said.\u00a0\"Making the public aware is the best way to achieve the change we all seek.\" Taking the politics out of the weather One freedom\u00a0Mollen enjoys though is the fact that weather presenters in Uganda are not under political pressure when it comes to reporting on climate change. The same goes for India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly supports a national shift toward\u00a0sustainability. \"Now in India, the government is very conscious about it [climate change],\" Singh said. \"And weather presenters are considered\u00a0an important part of this whole movement.\"\u00a0 That isn't the case in the US, however, where Woods says\u00a0\"the biggest challenge\" weather forecasters \u00a0currently face\u00a0is that climate change\u00a0\"has become a political issue.\"\u00a0 But she, together with hundreds of TV weather forecasters from around the world, is doing her best to move the issue out of the political arena\u00a0and put it more squarely in the spotlight.  Weather forecasting has improved massively. 40 years ago meteorologists could only predict weather for the next two or three days. Today weather can be predicted reliably for seven days. But forecasters also give monthly and seasonal predictions. These can be tremendously important for agriculture. If a severe storm is predicted ahead of time, farmers can prepare. Weather is forecast with the help of supercomputers that predict the weather using complex mathematical models and current weather conditions. Some centers for weather prediction take account of up to 900 million global points. For the prediction, the world is split up into grids with grid points spaced 9 km apart. In 1975 several European states decided to share their data to improve the forecast. They set up the \u201cEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast\u201d (ECMWF). Today the centre has 22 member states, 12 co-operating countries and some of the world's most modern supercomputers. Roughly a year and a half ago the centre expanded its weather models. Before, they were based on atmospheric predictions. Now the forecasts take more elements into account, such as ocean and land data. This makes them more reliable. With the weather changing due to climate change, forecasts are changing too. Scientists still cannnot link climate change and weather change exactly. Scientists are sure that climate change intensifies extreme weather events. Heatwaves are even hotter, hurricanes are more intense. That means weather forecasting today is also about saving lives and protecting property. If the forecasts are more exact and data is available faster, people can prepare better for severe weather events. Thunder and lightning are very hard to forecast and becoming more intense. It is impossible to predict exactly where lightning will strike. However, this might well improve. The ECMWF is working on predicting lightning within a 50 km range. In general, weather forecasting will continue to improve. By 2025 reliable weather forecasts might cover 10 days instead of the seven that are possible today. That could well mean three extra days to prepare for storms and extreme weather.

{"id": null, "body": "     Expanding fast, reliable internet access across Africa will bring advantages for society, business and the climate. But with operators mainly focused on profit, environmental solutions often take a back seat to cost. From money transfers and instant weather updates for farmers to apps that help reduce waste, save water or find elusive parking spots \u2014 mobile internet use has exploded throughout Africa \u00a0over the past decade. Mobile broadband connections there are expected to surpass 1.08 billion by 2024, according to industry data. \"Generally, across the continent, mobile devices remain the primary avenue for people to access the internet in place of laptops and similar digital devices,\" said Juliet Nanfuka of the group Collaboration on International ICT Policy in East and Southern Africa (CIPESA), which works to support development and reduce poverty through communication technologies. The rapid growth of mobile internet is expected to continue, with the World Bank aiming to achieve universal \"affordable and good quality broadband access\" in Africa \u00a0by 2030. That would add nearly 1.1 billion new users to the continent's network between now and the end of the decade, at a cost of roughly $109 billion (\u20ac 92.5 billion) for 4G service or equivalent.\u00a0 Smartphone users make the most of a Wi-Fi hotspot in Zimbabwe, one of the world's most expensive places when it comes to mobile data To avoid the added burden of CO2 emissions resulting from this tremendous expansion, the information and communications technology (ICT) sector will have to invest in climate-friendly solutions for its new data centers and transmission networks.\u00a0 Global greenhouse gas\u00a0 emissions caused by the ICT sector are expected to rise to 900 million tons by 2030 \u2014 last year, that figure was already at 800 million tons . If that projection holds true, the industry's climate footprint would increase to roughly 2% of worldwide emissions by the end of the decade, noted a 2019 report by the Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), which focuses on how digital tech can help society and the environment.\u00a0 That might not seem like much \u2014 though it's about the same as the yearly contribution by the global aviation business \u2014 but if left unchecked it could balloon to around 14% by 2040, according to projections by the European Commission.\u00a0 Read more :\u00a0 Is Africa ready for 5G? Still, successful efforts to green the ICT sector would do more than just cut those emissions. Knock-on effects across the continent could end up boosting the development of renewable energy and drive sustainable growth in sectors like business and agriculture. 5G, the latest generation of wireless mobile technology said to be 100 times faster than the current standard, began rolling out in Europe, Southeast Asia, and North America in early 2019. With wireless internet available everywhere \u2014 using much less energy to transmit data \u2014 more people will be able to work remotely and hook up countless energy-saving devices and sensors that can, for example, detect pollution, monitor and regulate water use and reduce traffic congestion. But it will be some time before this\u00a0 climate-friendly tech \u00a0is widespread in Africa; more than 50% of the continent's network coverage is currently served by 3G or lower. Preliminary research released on September 10 by Germany's Federal Environment Agency (UBA) showed that data transmission over 3G mobile networks \u2014 still one of the most widely used technologies for internet-connected devices around the world \u2014 generates 90 grams of CO2 per hour of high-definition\u00a0 video streaming \u00a0per device, factoring in the energy used by the data center and transmission. That's equivalent to powering a 100-watt light bulb or a desktop computer for around three hours, depending on the model. The ongoing 5G shift is expected to reduce that environmental toll by emitting only about 5 grams of CO2 per hour. But the UBA research found that fixed broadband services delivered through cables were still the best when it came to emissions, with fiber-optic connections producing only 2 grams of CO2 per hour. Copper cables, which have been used in circuitry and wiring for decades and are still widespread today, are responsible for around 4 grams of CO2 per hour. Presenting the UBA data , German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze emphasized that climate-friendly ICT networks were possible, even with the expected increase in data streaming in the coming years, \"if you do it right and choose the right method for data transmission.\"\u00a0 Noting the low climate cost of fiber-optic connections, Schulze suggested that public Wi-Fi hot spots could be a better alternative to mobile streaming. But while that may be a good option for Europe and other regions with well-established broadband networks, the cost of fiber-optic networks can be prohibitive in certain regions of Africa. Free, reliable public access to the internet also remains rare across the continent, limited to urban centers in a handful of countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has one of the world's widest mobile gender gaps, with only 35% of adult women using mobile internet according to the GSMA In Uganda, the government has been providing free Wi-Fi hot spots at nearly 300 locations through a service called MYUG since 2017. But, as Juliet Nanfuka of CIPESA pointed out, access can be slow and inadequate \u2014 the service is primarily found in and around the capital, Kampala, and limited to weekends from Saturdays at 3 p.m., and evenings and pre-dawn hours on weekdays. \"The move was welcomed, but it needed a bit more consultation with different actors in civil society,\" said Nanfuka, pointing out that the locations and time restrictions prevented many people \u2014 students, children, women \u2014 from accessing the networks. Governments in other countries \u2014 such as Botswana, Mozambique and Ghana \u2014 have also set up similar services with Universal Access Service Funds, which use mandatory contributions from telecommunications firms and reinvest them back into the sector to expand the network and reach underserved areas. But they can run into issues with funding and long-term viability, Eleanor Sarpong, deputy director with the Alliance for Affordable Internet, told DW.\u00a0 \"There needs to be a conversation about sustainability, and also the issue of power,\" she said. \"The cost of power can also be quite prohibitive, especially in regions of Africa where you don't have 24/7 reliable power.\" Sarpong said to ensure\u00a0 across-the-board access \u00a0\u2014 factoring in the cost of infrastructure, data and the devices used to access that data \u2014 governments need to get involved with targeted policies. \"If you really want to make universal access [for] everybody \u2014 whether they are rich or poor, whether they are in urban or rural areas \u2014 then you have to create either incentives or have a regulation that mandates that private sector players [expand] into certain areas, even if they don't find it profitable,\" she said. Facing these challenges, the issue of\u00a0 climate footprint \u00a0can often take a back seat. \"The environmental impact of the telecommunications sector is often neglected, despite its enormous importance,\" said Samuel Woodhams, a digital rights researcher at the London-based internet research firm Top10VPN. \"While increasing connectivity is vitally important, environmental considerations should also be carefully considered.\" Both Sarpong and Nanfuka said initiatives like infrastructure sharing, where operators pool resources such as generators or cable trenches to avoid doubling up, can help limit the environmental impact. However, this route is generally chosen for financial rather than eco-friendly reasons. Sarpong said that even when\u00a0 green solutions \u00a0like solar power or low-cost renewable batteries are available, the cost can be prohibitive for operators.\u00a0 \"One of the big hurdles that we have to face is the import duties on some of these sustainable, greener solutions,\" she said, pointing out that customs duties can be so high that network operators simply default to the standard, low-cost option, sidestepping environmental concerns. \"Policy and regulation are going to play a very big role \u2026 with the sustainability issue.\" Climate change has a disproportionate impact on communities which depend on the natural environment for their day-to-day needs. In Eritrea, it's estimated about 80% of the population are subsistence farmers, mainly growing sorghum, maize and teff. Such subsistence farmers are especially vulnerable to shifting weather patterns that can devastate food production and livelihoods. During the past few years, Eritrea, like the rest of the Horn of Africa, has experienced fluctuating weather patterns exacerbated by the ocean warming trend, El Ni\u00f1o. Rains fell unexpectedly in Eritrea in October last year resulting in the government advising farmers to reap early. \"Had they not reacted, or reacted based on the traditional harvest, they would probably lose their harvest,\" says Peter Smerdon with the World Food Programme. While El Ni\u00f1o is a complex and naturally occurring event, scientific research suggests that global warming could be making this cyclical event occur more frequently and intensely. Most of the world\u2019s scientific communities agree that long-term significant changes in the earth\u2019s climate system have occurred and are occurring more rapidly than in the past. Continued emissions into the earth\u2019s atmosphere are projected to cause further warming, impacting Africa in the form of increased temperatures and greater seasonal rainfall variability with more frequent extremes. \"People in wealthier countries should be worried about the effects of climate change in the Horn of Africa,\" says Challiss McDonough from the World Food Programme \"Climate change is one of the main drivers of global hunger, second only to conflict, so, for donor countries, investing in climate and disaster risk reduction makes economic sense.\" Pictured on the local Eritrean 5-Nakfa banknote, the sycamore tree has significant symbolism in Eritrea. Elders used to gather under these huge, hundred-year-old trees to discuss important community issues and laws. Many trees were cut down during colonization and war. Those that remain now have to contend with the effects of climate change. \"One impact of climate change in a coastal region is rising sea levels that impact lives along the coast and increases the likelihood of flooding or flood-related disaster such as high tides that could wash out a crop,\" Smerdon says. \"Also, salt-water intrusion due to climate change can increase erosion and increase salinity of soils and thereby damage soil content and fertility of land.\" Eritrea\u2019s stunning coastline includes coral reefs, offering a potential boon for tourism \u2013 if they survive in their present state. \"Until a few years ago, this piece of sea was full of corals, but then last year they all died,\u201d an Eritrean diver tells DW. \"The temperature of the sea was too high.\" At the same time, local fisherman rely on the ocean's resources to trade in fish and shells. The weather pattern changes in Eritrea are evident elsewhere. \"While working in Central America, East Africa, and the Middle East, I\u2019ve always talked to elder people, especially those in agriculture, and the message from them is consistent,\" says Sam Wood with Save the Children in Ethiopia. \"Weather patterns are becoming less predictable and when rain comes, it is too much or too little.\u201d Author: James Jeffrey, Milena Belloni An earlier version of this article stated that the\u00a0ICT sector produced 800 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions last year, with that amount\u00a0expected to rise to 900 metric tons by 2030.\u00a0The article has been corrected to reflect that the estimates\u00a0were 800 million tons and 900 million tons respectively.\u00a0 \u00a0 In several parts of Africa, paying for food, clothes or public transport with a phone is commonplace.

The assessments also highlight how global warming will drive mass migration. The US government wants to respond more efficiently to climate-related crises, such as devastating wildfires in California US President Joe Biden's administration sounded the alarm about the worsening climate and its impact on national security this week.\u00a0 Reports from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the White House on Thursday highlighted the ties between climate change, geopolitical conflict , and migration.\u00a0 In a summary of the intelligence assessments, the White House said future extreme weather events \"will increasingly exacerbate a number of risks to US national security interests, from physical impacts that could cascade into security challenges, to how countries respond to the climate challenge.\"\u00a0 The ODNI report said 11 countries, including Haiti and Afghanistan , are \"especially are likely to face warming temperatures, more extreme weather and disruption to ocean patterns that will threaten their energy, food, water, and health security.\" The Department of Defense (DoD), in its climate risk analysis,\u00a0said it will now \"consider the effects of climate change at every level of the DoD enterprise.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The DHS report aimed to put together a strategy to \"safeguard the homeland from current and projected climate change-driven disasters.\" This year alone, the US witnessed extreme heatwaves, multiple hurricanes and blazing wildfires , which experts say are a result of climate change.\u00a0\u00a0 The reports were also the first time the US government officially recognized that climate change is driving migration. The assessment from the White House suggested that the executive and legislative branches could work together to make climate-related reasons a consideration\u00a0when granting refugee status. It also highlighted how existing US foreign aid programs could be best used to \"reduce the risk of forced migration.\" Nina von Uexkull, an associate professor at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University in Sweden, told DW\u00a0 where she believes geopolitical tensions will escalate the most due to climate change. \"When assessing the security implications of climate change we rely on observations of the past. How do states react to increasing scarcity or new resources becoming available?\u00a0Generally, we do not see that armed conflicts between states are fought over resources that are directly affected by climate change such as freshwater,\"\u00a0von Uexkull said. \"It is, however, plausible and in line with existing evidence that increasing, not necessarily violent, tensions and disputes will arise from an increasingly ice-free Arctic and the resources and transport routes that become available in that region and changes in water availability in transboundary waters such as the Nile in coming decades,\" she added. The ODNI report also suggested that\u00a0\"climate change is likely to increase the risk of instability in countries in Central Africa and small island states in the Pacific.\"\u00a0 Von Uexkull agreed with the assessment\u00a0that Central Africa is a region that will see \"increased humanitarian and development challenges\" due to climate change-related conflicts, citing countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo .\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"The challenges to small island states in the Pacific are different,\" von Uexkull said. \"They are currently not affected by large-scale armed conflict but unmitigated climate change and resulting sea-level rise will threaten local populations' livelihood. This is no doubt very challenging and existentially threatening in the long term, but this does not necessarily mean that violence or instability will result from slow-moving changes like sea-level rise.\" The reports were released ahead of the UN climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland , which will take place from October 31 to November 12. Biden will attend the talks, with the US delegation expected to urge other nations to reduce greenhouse\u00a0gas emissions.\u00a0 Biden's advocacy of climate change mitigation is a stark contrast from his predecessor, Donald Trump. During his tenure as president, Trump downplayed climate change and pulled the US out of the 2015 Paris Accords . The US later moved to rejoin the\u00a0Paris Agreement on January 20, hours after Biden was sworn in as president.\u00a0 Florian Krampe, the director of the Climate Change and Risk Programme at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in Sweden, believes the US should work closely with European allies such as Germany to tackle climate-related security risks. \"Climate and security become inextricably linked \u2014 but the solutions aren't solely, or even primarily, military. Climate action, development and peacebuilding have to go hand in hand,\" Krampe told DW.\u00a0 \"Climate change is the defining security challenge of our time today \u2013 in the West and beyond,\" he said when asked whether climate change poses a greater security risk to the West than terrorism.\u00a0 He cited the\u00a0recent catastrophic flooding in Germany as one example, and noted that in countries such as Somalia, Mali and Afghanistan, \"climate-related impacts\u00a0on people's livelihoods are one of the many complex drivers that push people into joining extremist groups.\" \u00a0\n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate change poses national security risks, US agencies warn", "article_name": "climate-change-poses-national-security-risks-us-agencies-warn", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-poses-national-security-risks-us-agencies-warn/a-59587814", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 5552, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:50.633533"}

In Germany, brown coal (or lignite) is responsible for a fifth of the country's CO2 emissions . So a major step toward reducing greenhouse gases is\u00a0to replace fossil fuels\u00a0with renewable energies.\u00a0 In many countries, you can pick your energy provider. Consider switching\u00a0to one that provides energy from renewables like wind, solar, hydropower or sustainable bioenergy \u00a0\u2014 check to make sure the energy company and renewable sources\u00a0are independently certified. 2.\u00a0Eat less meat Cows also produce the greenhouse gas methane, which they release when they belch What ends up on your plate\u00a0makes another big difference. In a 2013\u00a0report,\u00a0the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) found that\u00a0 14.5 percent\u00a0of all human-induced greenhouse gas emissions came from the livestock sector .\u00a0 That is more than all cars, ships, planes\u00a0and other forms of transport throughout the world\u00a0combined.\u00a0Of those emissions, 41 percent are caused by beef production; milk production makes up another 19 percent. Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single simplest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, suggested\u00a0a study released this year in the\u00a0journal Science . Getting your protein from beef instead of\u00a0plants produces at least six times more greenhouse gases and uses 36 times more land. The study also revealed\u00a0the importance of how the food is produced. For example, beef raised on deforested land results in 12 times more greenhouse gases than those grazing on existing pasture. So if you do eat meat, get it from local organic farms if possible. 3.\u00a0Waste less food A third of all food produced gets wasted Agriculture accounts for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, but about a third of all food grown on this planet never actually gets eaten. Of course, not all of this goes into the waste bin \u2014 the European Parliament reckons about half of EU food waste takes place at home, the rest is lost along the supply chain or never harvested from the fields \u2014 but home is\u00a0a simple starting point. Food waste translates into\u00a0a carbon footprint of a whopping 3.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), according to the United Nations \u2014 amounting to more than India's annual emissions. An easy solution:\u00a0Buy less and make sure eat it all. 4.\u00a0Take a train instead of flying Flying harms the climate in several ways. Many estimates put aviation's share of global CO2 emissions at just above 2 percent \u2014 but other aviation emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapor, particulates, contrails and cirrus changes contribute to additional warming effects. Cut out a single roundtrip and you could save anywhere from 700 to 2,800 kilograms\u00a0of CO2, depending on the distance traveled, fuel efficiency of the aircraft and weather conditions. To put that into perspective: According to Eurostat, the average European emits about 900 kilograms of CO2 per year.\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 Trains vs. planes: What's the real cost of travel? If you do fly, consider offsetting your carbon emissions \u2014 through a reliable, certified offsetting scheme. 5. Just consume less Our consumption drains the natural resources of our planet Natural resources are limited. We deplete local resource stocks through overfishing and overharvesting forests, and harm the climate by emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than ecosystems can absorb. Most countries use\u00a0more natural resources than\u00a0the planet can regenerate within a year. In Germany, we\u00a0would need\u00a0 1.7 planets per year \u00a0to support our\u00a0consumption levels as they are today. But not all countries are equally to blame for overshooting our natural budget.\u00a0Higher-income countries use far more resources per year than lower-income countries. Worldwide, fossil fuels are the main culprit of\u00a0our resource overshoot \u2014 and responsible for high CO2 emissions. In order to live within the means of our planet, we need to radically rethink our consumption patterns. Do you really need that new smartphone, or discounted dress? Reducing our environmental footprint means\u00a0buying fewer products, buying products that last longer, recycling whenever possible and \u2014\u00a0best of all \u2014\u00a0reusing as much as we can. Circular economy , baby! 6.\u00a0Take collective action Movements are made up of individuals, but making a real difference is only really possible when people join forces Many believe the most important thing individuals can do is form\u00a0groups and take collective action . Bill McKibben, a veteran climate activist and a leading voice for civil society movements to protect the planet, is very vocal on this point . While individual actions like changing behavior feed\u00a0into the bigger fight against global warming, that's no longer enough considering how climate change has taken on such worrying dimensions, McKibben says. So to really make a difference, people should join together with others in movements that are big and broad enough to actually change government policy. You just bought a fancy lamp? Make it cooler with efficient lightbulbs. This is one of the small actions that make a difference in the long-term - and let's be honest, it's not a big effort. Some LED bulbs consume up to 90 percent less than traditional ones. In cold or rainy countries, the task might be challenging - but these challenges are nothing compared to the worst consequences of climate change. Recycling has become normal behavior for thousands of people around the world. It definitely contributes to making a better world - but unfortunately, it is not enough. Worried about your clothes shrinking in hot water? Here another reason to keep washing with cold water: Since it avoids turning on the water heater, cold-water washing also produces less greenhouse gas emissions. Until you are ready to get rid of your car completely, you could move to a hybrid electric car. But beware: The electricity that powers it is probably still coming from dirty fossil fuels. Beef production is the largest driver of tropical deforestation worldwide, with soy production closely following - mainly to feed animals. The carbon footprint of a meat-based diet is almost double that of a vegetarian one. Even reducing the amount of meat you eat makes a difference. Renewable energies are the new trend - but we are still largely dependent on fossil fuels such as coal. In countries like Germany, you can choose your energy provider - among some that draw from renewable sources. Air travel is a major challenge when it comes to tackling climate change. Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study. But if you start now with the other nine actions, your kids might be able to live in a better world. Author: Irene Banos Ruiz A new global warming report shows it's still not too late to avert the worst impacts of climate change. It just boils down to whether we can muster the will to do so, thinks DW's Sonya Diehn. (08.10.2018)\n\u00a0 The world is increasingly taking action to stop climate change. But the frequency of devastating climate events in 2017 has shown that we are starting to run out of time. DW takes at look at some of the most dramatic.

{"id": null, "body": "     China has joined the EU in presenting new plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions. But are they doing enough? And how about other countries? A clock that activists in New York recently turned into a countdown for catastrophic climate change\u00a0serves as a ticking reminder of how long it will take the Earth to warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2014 the level to which world leaders agreed to limit global warming when they met in Paris in 2015. Just seven years and about 100 days remain. Government representatives, business leaders and members of climate and environmental protection organizations descended on New York this week to discuss how to better protect the climate. What needs to change, however, is no secret: Humanity must drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. \"Basically, all countries are doing far too little for climate protection,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, a climate scientist\u00a0and co-founder of non-profit NewClimate Institute , which together with research organization Climate Analytics, published a report on Wednesday into the response to the coronavirus crisis. The analysis of its Climate Action Tracker (CAT) found \"just a hint of green\" in pandemic recovery plans. \"The corona pandemic poses particular challenges to the global community,\" said H\u00f6hne. \"Unfortunately, many states are using it as an excuse to abandon their climate protection efforts even further.\" Read more:\u00a0 Opinion: Global climate strikers take on inactive leaders The United States, he said, has made almost no provision for investment in climate or environmental protection in its reconstruction program, and is unconditionally supporting polluting industries like airlines. \u00a0 The CAT details how Russia's new energy strategy also continues to promote fossil fuels while its stimulus package is completely free of climate-related measures.\u00a0 Mexico, meanwhile, is cited as using the pandemic\u00a0as an excuse to stop the expansion of renewable energies and instead promote fossil fuels, while Brazil is doing little to combat rising deforestation and emissions from agriculture. Environmental regulations there are instead being relaxed or even withdrawn. The report focuses on the investment plans of five countries: China, the US, the EU, India \u00a0and South Korea. \"In addition to the EU , South Korea has deliberately put a green focus on coronavirus aid with its Korean Green New Deal,\" said H\u00f6hne. But it is not yet possible to predict exactly how India's plans will affect the climate. Until now, China has not looked set to become climate-friendly. But Chinese President Xi Jinping threw predictions into confusion at the UN General Assembly this week when he unveiled plans to strive for CO2 neutrality before 2060. \"This is the most important announcement in global climate policy in at least five years,\" said H\u00f6hne. \"If China, which is responsible for a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, were actually to be CO2-neutral before 2060, this would reduce the forecasts for global warming by around 0.2 to 0.3 degrees Celsius\". But even with China's new climate protection plans, the Earth will warm by an average of 2.4 to 2.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, according to CAT. Even this year's global CO2 emissions, which have fallen by about 5% to 9% due to coronavirus lockdowns , would not change the direction. Signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement committed to announce their self-set \"ambitious climate targets\" for 2030. But so far only 12 countries have done so, according to the CAT. Smaller countries, such as Chile and Norway, are more ambitious. Rwanda is also setting the pace in climate protection. In May, the East African country became the first on the continent to announce that it would tighten its climate targets and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 16% by 2030. \"Rwanda is demonstrating the kind of leadership that the world needs right now,\" said Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, adding that it was \"an inspiration for other countries looking to step up their climate action.\" Mountford said the pandemic could have a positive effect in the long-term despite the lack of progress so far. Industrialized countries depend on the global south, for example in food production. To maintain the flow of goods and keep migration movements to a minimum, said Mountford, there is a growing interest in doing more for the well-being of these countries \u2014 including limiting negative climate impacts. Rixa Schwarz, team leader for international climate policy at the NGO Germanwatch, said the pandemic illustrates the importance of resilience: the ability of societies to deal with crises. \"Lessons must now be learned for the climate crisis and the global community must be made resilient to shocks such as pandemics and climate impacts,\" Schwarz said.\u00a0 The Climate Protection Index \u2014 published once a year by Germanwatch , NewClimate Institute and the nonprofit Climate Action Network International \u2014 shows how far the world is from this goal. No country reaches first to third place because no country is doing enough to avoid dangerous climate change, the authors wrote. China's announcement should improve its ranking in next year's Climate Protection Index. But there is a long way till 2060. And the clock keeps ticking towards 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2014 seven years and almost 100 days. Adaptation: Ajit Niranjan As the world grinds to a halt, the sudden shutdown of most industrial activities has dramatically reduced air pollution levels. Satellite images have even revealed a clear drop in global levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gas which is primarily emitted from car engines and commercial manufacturing plants and is responsible for poor air quality in many major cities. Like NO2, carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) have also been slashed in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. When economic activity stalls, so do CO2 emissions \u2014 in fact, the last time this happened was during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In China alone, emissions have fallen by around 25% when the country entered lockdown, according to Carbon Brief. But this change is likely to only be temporary. As everyone retreats to their homes, some animals have been taking advantage of our absence. Reduced road traffic means little critters like hedgehogs emerging from hibernation are less likely to be hit by cars. Meanwhile, other species like ducks may be wondering where all the people have gone and will need to find other sources of food besides breadcrumbs in the park. Conservationists hope the coronavirus outbreak will help curb global wildlife trade, which is responsible for pushing a number of species to the brink of extinction. COVID-19 likely originated in a Wuhan wet market, which sells live produce and is a hub for both legal and illegally trafficked wildlife. A crackdown on trading live wildlife may be one positive thing to come out of the crisis.\u202f\u202f Shortly after Italy entered lockdown, images of crystal clear canals in Venice were shared around the world \u2014 the pristine blue waters are a far cry from their usual muddy appearance. And with cruise ships docked for the time being, our oceans are also experiencing a drop in noise pollution, lowering the stress levels of marine creatures like whales and making for a much more peaceful migration. But it's not all good news. One of the worst environmental side-effects of the coronavirus pandemic is the rapid increase in the use of disposable plastic \u2014 from medical equipment like disposable gloves, to plastic packaging as more people opt for prepackaged foods. Even cafes that remain open no longer accept reusable cups from customers in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. With the coronavirus dominating, the climate crisis has been pushed to the sidelines. But that doesn't make it any less urgent. Experts are warning that important decisions regarding the climate should not be delayed \u2014 even with the UN climate conference postponed until 2021. While emissions have dropped since the pandemic began, we're unlikely to see widespread and long-term change as a result.  Author: Ineke Mules In the latest example of a wave of climate litigation across the world, six young people this week filed a case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, asking for accountability around the climate crisis. \u00a0 Overconsumption, not overpopulation, drives climate change. A projected decline in fertility could see the world's population peak in just four decades, with Japan and Spain halving in size.\n\u00a0 German lawmakers have backed a legislative package to end the use of coal in less than two decades. But activists have decried the measures, saying they aren't bold enough to mitigate the impact of climate change. \n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "How successful are international climate efforts?", "article_name": "climate-emissions-paris-agreement", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-emissions-paris-agreement/a-55044341", "date_published": "2020-09-24 00:00:00", "article_length": 8884, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:03:52.381502"}
{"id": null, "body": "     The countries hit hardest by climate change are struggling to attend a UN climate summit that has been hailed as the \"best last chance\" to stop global warming. What are the implications? Climate youth activists, Indigenous people, and parents call on leaders to 'End Climate Betrayal' A catalog of mistakes means that representatives from the Global South have found it difficult to show up to a conference in the United Kingdom where world leaders are deciding how to slow the planet's further heating. The number of people registered to attend COP26 has doubled from the last UN climate conference in 2019 to almost 40,000 people, according to documents published by the organizers Tuesday, but delegates and observers from poorer countries say their colleagues have struggled to make it to the summit. Travel restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus, last-minute changes in quarantine rules, and the high costs of flights and hotels have forced many delegates to attend the conference via video call. Because of restrictions on space in the rooms in Glasgow , environmental groups representing vulnerable people across the world say they have been shut out of meetings. The summit \u2014 hailed as the \"best last chance\" to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures \u2014 is an opportunity for world leaders to agree on deals that would stave off increasingly extreme weather. The collective voice of those who really need urgent climate action is what matters, said Tasneem Essop, international director of Climate Action Network, a global network of 1,500 civil society groups. \"Unfortunately, that is already diminished,\" Essop said. The UK government, which is hosting the event, claimed in May that COP26 should be \"the most inclusive COP ever\" and offered vaccines to all delegates, observers and media. But participants have said both vaccines and visas were difficult to get hold of. Particularly frustrating, they say, is that most poor and middle-income countries were only taken off the UK's coronavirus red list \u2014 for which incoming travelers would need to quarantine for 10 days \u2014 two weeks before the conference. At such short notice, some delegates had no choice but to stay at home, while others who booked travel last-minute\u00a0have only been able to find accommodation in the neighboring city Edinburgh. \"If you're not represented, your views are not being considered,\" said Colin Young, director of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CARICOM), a group of 15 Caribbean countries, some of which were initially on the red list. \"Our delegations are always small to start with because of issues of funding. When you have to trim that down even more, then representation is really an issue that we are concerned about.\" At the heart of the dispute is a question of fairness. Countries from the Global South, which\u00a0have done the least to cause climate change but bear the brunt of its damages, are fighting for agreements on two key deals at the summit. The first is to fulfil a broken promise made by rich countries at a climate summit in 2009 to give poorer ones\u00a0 $100 billion a year by 2020 to green their economies and adapt to climate change. The second is to acknowledge their role in the losses and damages caused by increasingly extreme weather events like tropical cyclones and wildfires. Delegates face long waits to get into the COP26 summit. Some 40,000 are registered to attend but many from the Global South have not been able to make it \"That has been an issue that the rich nations have not wanted to address at all,\" said Essop from Climate Action Network. The voices of poorer countries, she added, would be \"critical\" to ensure rich countries finance losses and damages. \"If the developed countries are serious, they need to show that leadership commitment,\" said Halima Bawa-Bwari, an environmental scientist at the Department of Climate Change, Nigeria, adding that many of the Nigerian delegation were missing meetings because they were commuting from outside the city. The UNFCCC, the body that organizes climate negotiations, published a list of registered participants after requests from DW. It shows that compared to the previous year, around 150 countries increased the size of their delegation, 6 stayed the same, and 33 registered smaller delegations.\u00a0 But it is unclear how many of those roughly 22,000 registered delegates, 14,000 observers and 4,000 journalists will turn up. The UNFCCC did not specify which participants are only attending virtually. It had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication. \"If it's held virtually, Africa \u00a0can't participate,\" said Mamoudou Ouedraogo from the civil society group Association for Education and Environment in Burkina Faso, adding that\u00a0unlike many of his colleagues, he was lucky to be able to get to Glasgow.\u00a0 Participants attending virtually have to battle with poor internet connections. \"You can go two, three days without\u00a0internet,\" Ouedraogo said. Bianca Coutinho, an advocacy advisor at ICLEI, a group representing mayors across the world, said they had been forced to ask mayors from cities in the Global South to speak on behalf of others who could not make it. They also held joint sessions with some participants attending virtually and others in-person. \"Luckily, the hybrid events are working,\" she said. Elsewhere within the conference halls, participants are finding it hard to take part in sessions described as open. To help maintain social distancing, many sessions are ticketed. But coalitions of environmental groups have been granted just a handful of tickets to cover dozens of events, campaigners said. \"There is not enough space in the venue to accommodate everybody that is accredited,\" said Nathan Thanki from the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice. The overall result, participants have complained, is a climate summit in which the countries and peoples hit hardest by climate change are unable to get their voices heard. \"Civil society, social movements and governments have found it incredibly challenging to jump through all the hoops necessary to get here to the UK,\" said Thanki. \"Compared to previous years, this COP is one of the whitest.\" With additional reporting from Irene Banos Ruiz and Heather Moore, and data analysis from Gianna Gr\u00fcn A wildfire that burned through at least 7,780 hectares (30 square miles) in about a week and devastated forests in southern Spain was brought under control thanks to steady rains. The downpour helped the firefighters, who were backed by some 50 aircrafts. The blaze was one of the most difficult to combat in recent times in Spain. Some 2,600 people were forced to flee their homes. Unprecedented flooding \u2014 caused by two months' worth of rainfall in two days \u2014 has resulted in devastating damage in central Europe, leaving at least 226 people dead in Germany and Belgium. Narrow valley streams swelled into raging floods in the space of hours, wiping out centuries-old communities. Rebuilding the ruined homes, businesses and infrastructure is expected to cost billions of euros. While half of Europe is drowning, elsewhere areas are going up in flames: Large fires raged, particularly in Greece, Italy and Turkey. They have caused unforeseeable monetary damage, while thousands of people in Europe have lost their homes and their belongings. In addition to deadly wildfires, Italy also battled record heat temperatures, with the Italian Health Ministry issuing the maximum possible heat warning level for many cities. On the island of Sicily, 48.8 degrees Celsius (almost 120 degrees Fahrenheit) was measured on August 11 \u2014 a new European heat record. The heat could make existing fires worse, or lead to new ones. Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire continues smoldering in California. It's California's largest fire on record, and among the most destructive in the state's history \u2014 it wiped the town of Greenville off the map. Although it's about 60% contained, the fire continues to burn two months in. Meanwhile, hot and dry conditions continue in the region, spreading fears of more fire. Earlier this summer, record floods also hit parts of India and central China, overwhelming dams and drains and flooding streets. The downpours have been particularly heavy, even for the rainy season. Scientists have predicted that climate change will lead to more frequent and intense rainfall \u2014 warmer air holds more water, creating more rain. As nations flood in northern Europe, Mediterranean countries like Greece were in the grip of several heat waves. In the first week of July, temperatures soared to 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit). Tourism hot spots like the Acropolis were forced to shut during the day, while the extreme heat also sparked forest fires outside Thessaloniki, which helicopters tried to douse. \"It is an unprecedented reality in Sardinia\u2019s history,\" said Sardinia's Governor Christian Salinas of the ongoing wildfires that have scorched the historic central western area of Montiferru. \"So far, 20,000 hectares of forest that represent centuries of environmental history of our island have gone up in ashes.\" Around 1,500 people were evacuated from the island by the end of July. Intense heat is becoming more common, as seen in late June in the US states of Washington and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Scorching temperatures under a \"heat dome,\" hot air trapped for days by high pressure fronts, caused hundreds of heat-related deaths. The village of Lytton recorded a high of 49.6 Celsius (121 Fahrenheit) \u2014 and burned to the ground the next day. Heat and drought are fueling one of the most intense wildfire seasons in the West Coast and Pacific Northwest regions. Oregon's Bootleg Fire, which burned an area the size of Los Angeles in just two weeks, was so big it created its own weather and sent smoke all the way to New York City. A recent study said the weather conditions would have been \"virtually impossible\" without climate change. To the south, central Brazil is suffering its worst drought 100 years, increasing the risk of fires and further deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Researchers recently reported that a large swath of the southeastern Amazon has flipped from absorbing to emitting planet-warming CO2 emissions, pushing the rainforest closer to a \"tipping point.\" After years of unrelenting drought, more than 1.14 million people in Madagascar are food-insecure, with some now forced to eat raw cactus, wild leaves and roots, and locusts in famine-like conditions. With the absence of natural disaster, crop failure or political conflict, the dire situation in the African nation is said to be first famine in modern history caused solely by climate change. The number of people fleeing conflict and natural disasters hit a 10-year high in 2020, with a record 55 million people relocating within their own country. That's in addition to some 26 million people who fled across borders. A joint report released by refugee monitors in May found that three-quarters of the internally displaced were victims of extreme weather \u2014 and that number is likely to grow.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change has made the extremely high temperatures in Europe more than twice as likely to occur, a new analysis has revealed. How do scientists calculate the link between extreme weather events and climate change? Record-breaking temperatures of up to 39 degrees Celcius (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in Germany;\u00a0 out-of-control wildfires in Sweden \u00a0and other typically cool northerly regions; and a toxic algae outbreak in the warmer than usual Baltic Sea in Poland\u00a0\u2014 Europe is sweltering in the current heat wave. With the extreme high temperatures continuing in most parts of Europe, people are asking: Is climate change to blame?\u00a0 Scientists say yes. \"Climate change has generally increased the odds of the current heat wave more than two-fold,\" said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. He is part of World Weather Attribution (WWA), a network of scientists in six institutions established to provide near-real-time analysis of possible links between climate change and extreme weather events. A WWA team\u00a0has analyzed the current heat wave in northern Europe\u00a0and presented preliminary results on Friday. To stay cool in record-high temperatures, you can follow the example of this little boy: play at a fountain How do scientists connect specific weather events to climate change? Pinning down blame for complex weather events isn't straightforward, due to the numerous variables involved, from water temperature to air pressure. But thanks to state-of-the-art climate models, scientists can now calculate the likelihood of\u00a0individual extreme weather events having happened due to climate change. Read more: \u00a0 Climate change and extreme weather: Science is proving the link Like how epidemiologists link smoking to cancer, climate scientists work with statistical probability.\u00a0 \"Smoking is never the only reason \u2014 but it increases the likelihood to develop cancer,\" Friederike Otto, researcher at\u00a0the Oxford University's\u00a0Environmental Change Institute and member of the WWA, told DW. To determine the likelihood that an individual extreme weather event is caused by climate change, scientists estimate what the probability of a particular extreme event would be in the climate of today, versus\u00a0in the climate of a world free of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. We've already warmed the globe by about 1 degree Celsius, compared to pre-industrial times. By comparing the results of these two scenarios, scientists can attribute any differences in\u00a0probability of the extreme event to human-caused climate change. With this method, the WWA network has already shown that climate change made Hurricane Harvey in 2017 three times as likely to happen , the Lucifer heat wave that swept southern Europe in 2017 four times as likely to happen, and did\u00a0 not change the likelihood of the 2014 Sao Paolo drought taking place. The banks of the river Rhine in D\u00fcsseldorf have cracked due to dryness How did they calculate the probability of climate change causing the current heat wave? The WWA researchers compared the currently high temperatures with historical records at seven weather stations in northern Europe \u2014 two in Finland and one each in Denmark, the Irish Republic, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The weather stations were selected for practical reasons. Current temperature data could be accessed in real time, and all of them had digitalized records extending back to the early 1900s. For each year in the historical record, the scientists looked at the hottest consecutive three days. For\u00a02018, they took\u00a0the hottest three days of the year so far. They then fed their\u00a0the datainto \u00a0climate models, and compared the results of the world today with the world from the past when greenhouse gas emissions were much lower. In the case of Copenhagen, the group found that a heat wave like the current one occurs every seven years in our current\u00a0world. But in a world without manmade climate change, such a heat wave as\u00a0this one occurs only every 35 years. Even dogs seek refreshment during the current heat wave \"We can thus say climate change increased the likelihood of the event to occur by a factor of ten [in the case of Copenhagen],\" Otto told DW. Compiling all the results from the seven analyzed weather stations across Europe, the scientists found that the probability of\u00a0such heat waves is overall twice as probable today than if human activities had not altered the climate. The results are not yet peer-reviewed, because the WWA scientists are aiming to provide a quick analysis of current extreme weather events since public interest is high. They do plan to publish the results formally in a scientific journal, as\u00a0they have done with previous analyses. Why is it important to attribute specific extreme weather events to climate change? Climate change is an abstract topic with abstract measures, for example the increase of the\u00a0average global temperature on Earth. But people don't experience average temperatures; they experience heavy rainfall (including flooding), heat waves, severe storms and droughts, researchers point out. \"It's very important to provide illustrations of the effects of climate change,\" Robert Vautard, a senior scientist with France's Laboratory for Climate and Environment Sciences, told DW. Only when we undestand\u00a0what climate change looks like can\u00a0we can prepare for it, he thinks.\u00a0 After the deadly heat wave in 2003, which resulted in the death of\u00a015,000 people in France alone, the French government created an emergency plan to deal with future heat-related health problems.\u00a0 But experts believes their plan might already be outdated.\u00a0 \"Our infrastructure and healthcare plans are based on heat waves and rainfall\u00a0we have witnessed in the past. But we have to realize that the climate today is not the same it used to be, and it will be very different in the future,\" Vautard added. Lawmakers in the United Kingdom, where unusual high temperatures of more than 30 degrees Celsius were recorded last week, face\u00a0a similar fear. They have warned that premature deaths from heat waves could triple by 2050, and call upon the government to develop a strategy to protect the health of the public. Will we see more extreme weather events in the future? Climate scientists almost universally agree: Yes. \"Extreme heat events like this one will become more frequent and more intense as the globe continues to warm,\" Andrew King, a researcher at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of Melbourne, told DW.\u00a0 \"We know that heat waves and hot summers, like the infamous hot summer of 2003 in Europe, will very likely occur in most years, even under only\u00a02 degrees Celsius\u00a0of global warming,\" he added. The Paris Climate Agreement seeks to limit global warming between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius\u00a0but on our current track, we are moving towards 3 degrees warming . The climate is not just getting hotter \u2014 it's getting less\u00a0predictable. Variability of extreme weather events will increase, confirmed\u00a0climate scientist\u00a0Otto. While we may one year see heat waves, the next year we could experience\u00a0extreme rainfall. And the picture can look very different from location to location. \"The dangerous thing about climate change is that what we are not adapted to the changes,\" said Otto.\u00a0 Beyond the urgent current need to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius, learning to adapt quickly to extreme weather events will be a great\u00a0challenge for\u00a0the future. Summer 2018 began as a welcome break from Europe's often-unpredictable weather, and people took advantage of the constantly warm temperatures to spend more time outside. The heat was especially a boon for pubs and bars where fans congregated to watch the soccer World Cup. But as temperatures climbed to up to 39 Celsius, the heat wave's negative effects began to be felt across the continent. The high temperatures and low rainfall led to a sharp rise in wildfires across several European countries, including Sweden, where authorites were, at one stage, battling more than 50 blazes, some in the Arctic Circle. When German firefighters tackled a forest fire in Fichtenwalde, near Berlin, their operation was suddenly made more urgent by the discovery of unexploded World War II ammunition. Greece, meanwhile is counting the cost of its own devastating wildfire which last week left 86 people dead. The seaside village of Mati, just 30 kilometers (17 miles) from Athens, saw houses and land incinerated, while many people drowned after rushing into the sea or were burned alive while trying to escape in their cars. Many of Europe's rivers and reservoirs experienced almost drought-like conditions after water levels dropped severely. Freight vessels that ply German sections of the River Rhine (pictured here in D\u00fcsseldorf) and Danube were ordered not to sail fully loaded. The Netherlands meanwhile closed several movable bridges after the metallic structures expanded so much that they couldn't be opened. As millions of Europeans hit roads, rail and air for their annual summer holidays, transport infrastructure struggled to cope. Eurotunnel passengers faced delays of up to five hours after the air conditioning units failed on trains. Some holidaymakers were forced to spend the night at Hanover airport after authorities canceled flights when one of the runways started to melt. Poland shut scores of beaches along the Baltic Sea coast after the heat wave triggered a massive toxic algae bloom. German health officials, meanwhile, warned the elderly and others with weaker immune systems to avoid swimming in the Baltic Sea as the increased water temperature poses a danger from vibrio bacteria, which can cause severe illness. German farmers estimated the damage to crops from the heat wave could reach \u20ac1.4 billion and warned of higher supermarket prices. Other countries predicted the worst grain harvest in 25 years, as crops ripened much faster than expected and low rainfall produced a low yield. In Sweden, dairy farmers said they were being forced to slaughter some of their livestock. Until storms broke the intense heat on Friday evening, Parisians made use of the city's recreational facilities to keep cool, including water fountains around the Eiffel Tower. Despite being 3,324 pages long, France's infamous labor code doesn't mention a specific temperature that would force companies to shut down. But staff can't be punished if they stop work over fears for their health. Parts of Europe experienced up to six weeks of uncomfortably hot weather. Forecasters predicted that the first storms would bring heavy rainfall to many areas this weekend. Thunder, rain and hail were reported in France and the UK on Friday evening, while the darkening clouds alerted the crowd at this cricket match just outside the English city of Leeds to prepare for a similar downpour.

{"id": null, "body": "     Artificial intelligence is expected to transform our society in numerous ways. Some artists are also using it to better highlight the global impacts of climate change. The effects of climate change are all too real. The world is warming , sea levels are rising , species are on the verge of extinction and millions of people are suffering \u2014\u00a0both physically and mentally . Although these effects can be seen and felt all around us, the data measuring these impacts can be complex and confusing if not presented properly. That's where visual data scientists come in. Their job is to collect and convey statistics showing the impacts of climate change so that governments and policymakers can make informed decisions based on the best available evidence. If that evidence is too complex or too broad\u00a0to understand, then policymakers could have a hard time deciding on how best to handle certain problems. That's according to visual data scientist Thomas Nocke from Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who says visuals are vital when conveying large amounts of data. \"Of course, you cannot explain everything that's behind the statistics and you need to target the correct audience, but visuals are easily digestible and easily understood and can be used to present complex information directly and in powerful ways,\" he told DW.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0 Will AI change the future of music? \u00a0 Nocke admitted, however, that scientific visuals are somewhat limited \u2014 and that this\u00a0limitation can hinder development and progress when used to inform the public.\u00a0 \"We don't\u00a0enjoy\u00a0the same creative freedom that artists enjoy, which means our visuals can only go so far in raising awareness,\" he added. Can an algorithm be creative? Climate data art Maja Petric, an artist who lives on the American Pacific coast in Seattle, wants to raise the bar and convey climate data in unique, inspiring ways so that more people can become aware of climate issues. \"I'm very passionate about using cutting-edge technologies such as AI as an artistic tool to engage people's emotions. That's why I've created a custom AI system called AIEye to capture people's perspective on climate change,\" she said. Petric explained that the AIEye algorithm she helped to create with computer scientist Mihai Jalobeanu searches thousands of images on the internet for climate change-related phenomena, such as air pollution, global warming, overpopulation and deforestation.\u00a0 The system then processes all the found images, analyzes their salient properties and summarizes the data into one image \u2014 or an image within thousands of evolving images \u2014 that she calls\u00a0the \"Lost Skies.\" The images used for Lost Skies come\u00a0from Hurricane Maria , California wildfires and other natural disasters. The purpose of the images, she explained, is intended to express the essence of nature affected by climate change. AI advantages in art But she admitted\u00a0that her artwork wouldn't have been possible without artificial intelligence. \"My AIEye program sifted, learned and reasoned through massive amounts of data that no human would ever be able to review,\" she explained. That being said, Petric is firm that human creativity created the project, and that it was her imagination that got things off the ground in the first place.\u00a0 Each pixel in Lost Skies evolves as the algorithm progresses, says Maja Petric And while some people fear the advancements of artificial intelligence and how the new technology could impact the world, Petric welcomes\u00a0its inclusion. \"AI will not replace art. I believe AI has a capability to exceed certain human abilities, but I believe that human creativity is not one of them,\" she said. Read more: \u00a0 AI could help us protect the environment \u2014 or destroy it AI has also been instrumental in other fields, and most recently has aided students at Stanford University as an environmental monitoring tool in detecting environmental violations through data analysis\u00a0and predicting where funds can yield the most benefits.\u00a0 It has also helped in reducing energy consumption in Google data centers around the world. In a way, artificial intelligence has become a game changer in fighting climate change. And it's about to make a lasting impact in the art world as well. \"It's important for artists to use AI and it's crucial for AI to be used by artists. AI will shape our world more in the next 100 years, and as a woman artist, I want to be part of that conversation right now,\" Petric said. Raising awareness of climate change through comics \u2014 that's the goal of Zambian cartoonist Mwelwa Musonko, founder of Foresight Comics. His work includes cartoons on Germany's energy transition, drawn in 2018 while on the International Journalists' Programme (IJP). This cartoon looks at the focus on immigration in Germany and Europe \u2014 ignoring the \"elephant in the room\" that is climate change. In another cartoon, Mwelwa's pen takes aim at how the world's meat and dairy sector is heating up the planet. Drawn while on a placement at Clean Energy Wire in Germany as part of the IJP, it followed a report from the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and GRAIN in 2018 that said the world's livestock industry could eat up 80 percent of the globe's allowable carbon budget by 2050. Mwelwa, aka \"Tax,\" also gave his take on Germans' attitudes to the energy transition. This came on the back of surveys suggesting that while Germans support a switch to renewables in principal, they're less keen on the costs that come with it. The artist told DW that cartoons are a great way to communicate the dangers of climate change, saying: \"Art is a perfect way of getting a message through.\" This cartoon was inspired by data showing Germans are reluctant to say goodbye to their petrol and diesel cars in exchange for an electric vehicle, despite the government offering a \u20ac4,000 ($4,676) subsidy per car. Two years after Germany launched the subsidy scheme, only one-sixth of the earmarked funds have been used, said a report from the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control. Germany's lignite mines also got Mwelwa's satirical treatment in this cartoon. Lignite, or brown coal, is extracted using opencast mining in Germany and it made up around 23 percent of the country's power production in 2017, according to AG Energiebilanzen (Energy Balances Group). Lignite-burning power stations are high on the list of Europe's largest CO2 producers. In 2018, Mwelwa came up with a unique way to raise climate change awareness by launching a comic book series. The Fifth Element follows the adventures of superhero Quin Ence, a 10th grader in Lusaka, Zambia, as she battles to save the planet from global warming. He told DW he created the series over concerns that \"the majority of Zambians think that climate change is a foreign problem.\" Mwelwa hopes the comics will raise awareness of climate change among children and teens \u2014 using eye-catching cartoons to overcome what he calls an aversion to reading in Zambia. \"The reading culture where I am from in Zambia is really, really bad,\" he told DW. \"So, if you would give somebody a book with pictures in it, I think it sparks their interest. Trying to create value with this art.\" Mwelwa decided to make his superhero a girl because it \"brings a different thing to the table,\" telling DW that comic book writers are increasingly talking about creating more female characters. He added: \"If you follow my comic book, you start to see that this character is not perfect. Her life is miserable, and she rises above all of that to save the world and fight climate change.\" Author: Melanie Hall Bridging art and science\u00a0 Petric also highlighted the importance of science in art. \"In many ways, my art is inspired and shaped by science. Science provides us with information, facts and organized knowledge that can be cognitively processed. Art, meanwhile, is a medium that is deeply visceral and has potential to emotionally convey data, information and stories. As such, art is moving and can make a lasting impact,\" she said. Thomas Nocke, who\u00a0had some experience creating data artwork as a\u00a0university student, welcomes\u00a0the artwork and others like it but says\u00a0science is still the most important medium when presenting data.\u00a0 \"I worry that such artwork maybe takes too much away from the data. But in the end, climate science needs visuals and typically, these visuals are very important,\" he said. Twitterbots have a bad rap \u2014 that all they do is spread false news. But some are creative geniuses, and computer scientist Tony Veale told DW why.

{"id": null, "body": "     President of Mauritius Ameenah Gurib-Fakim tells DW how her island nation is preparing for the impact of climate change - and adjusting its own energy systems to try to prevent climate change from getting any worse. Mauritius is a small island nation in the Indian Ocean, about 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) off the coast of Africa. The country's GDP is among the highest of African nations, and Mauritius also has a well-functioning democracy. It's also among the world's biodiversity hotspots, especially for plants. As an island nation, it is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Deutsche Welle: How does Mauritius experience climate change? Ameenah Gurib-Fakim: Whilst we have not polluted - [the entire African continent has] produced around 2 percent in terms of the carbon emissions - we are likely to be highly impacted. One of the areas where we will suffer the brunt of climate change is with much more violent cyclones. The other part will be the erosion of the coast with the rising sea level. And whatever touches the coast means impacting the tourism industry. It also impacts the livelihoods of people, for those who depend on the lagoons for fishing and other activities. Tourism is a money-maker in Mauritius - and will be impacted by climate change We have seen really intense drought, and we have also seen a lot of flooding. So we have to have a state of preparedness so the people are aware that climate change is a reality and climate change will impact on everything we do. And we really have to develop strategies for adaptation. What specifically is Mauritius planning in order to prepare for this range of effects you described and which are already being felt? Our livelihoods on this planet depend on the sustainability of our biodiversity resources. And small island states like Mauritius belong to a biodiversity hotspot. Biodiversity ensures our survival on this planet. We have to have recourse to biodiversity for medicine, for food, and everything else. And this represents 35 percent of the ecosystem services that vulnerable people depend on. So it is imperative that leaders in this world are made aware of the necessity to protect this biodiversity, these ecosystems - because our survival will depend on it. What specifically are you planning in order to protect biodiversity as climate change kicks in? People don't know what they have. So one of the areas we have to focus on is the necessity to keep on documenting these resources. It's only when we document that we will be able to take action and strategize as to how to best protect them. Mauritius intends to keep its remaining primal forest intact to prevent further climate change In the Paris Agreement, one of the goals is to preserve and restore forests. What is the plan in terms of your island nation preserving its forests? This is an area we have not been very good at, because we have lost most of the original forest cover. Right now, we have something like less than 2 percent of the initial forest cover. You know, forests are the world's lungs. Forests also include a diversity of species, and yet we are destroying this at a very, very fast pace, through, for example, logging or through land being cleared for agriculture. And with the impact of climate change, we have to keep the original forest intact. Does Mauritius have a specific roadmap for decarbonizing its energy system? We are trying to diversify the bouquet as far as possible. During the sugarcane harvest, we use a lot of biogas for energy. But of course after the harvest, we still have to resort to fossil fuel for our energy needs. So what the government is trying to do now - and this has formed part of our INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) in the submission to the COP21 documents - is that we are going to diversify further our energetic requirement. So go into solar, go into wind \u2026 and because we are surrounded by the ocean, we will have to also try and see to what extent we can tap into wave energy as well. Mauritius is a member of the Alliance of Small Island States and was a part of the high-ambition coalition that pushed for 1.5 degrees Celsius at COP21. What other measures is Mauritius taking at this point to bring the Paris Agreement forward? Is it working internationally? We do lots of work, for example, with the Indian Ocean Commission, which is one of the flagship projects of the EU and has been our funding partner. The Indian Ocean Commission has expanded to a few eastern African countries. So the future will be in partnership - South-South, but North-South as well. But we need to use as much technology as possible to empower the people and make them aware that technology is here to help. Mauritius has progressed largely through the political will to do so, Gurib-Fakim says How can leaders of developing countries get on board for decarbonization? Mauritius was considered a lost case in the 1960s, so far away from everywhere else. Yet we've shown that it can happen. It can happen through will, through the government working with the people and through taking the right decisions to make it happen. We have advanced through empowering the people, through a democratic process, through accountability, and also through free education. There's quite a compelling business case for renewables in the long term. How can leaders be convinced of this compelling case? Countries have to have access to energy. Energy is a must; it drives the economies. So these leaders are confronted with ensuring that access to energy is there. How do they go about it? This is where the Green Fund, with the appropriate technologies, comes in. This is the hand-in-hand between North and South, working together, so that this can happen. But we have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement. Hopefully by the end of 2016 or early 2017, we will see countries having the will to sign. We are still waiting for one of the big partners - the European Union - to sign. There has to be the will for all the partners to come together and make it happen, so that people have access to energy for their own development. Ameenah Gurib-Fakim holds a PhD in organic chemistry What is the main challenge you're facing in terms of adaptation to climate change? How do we access the appropriate information, how do we access the appropriate technology, the means, and how do we make it happen on the ground. Of course at the end of the day, it all boils down to: finance. [chuckles] Is Mauritius prepared for the impact of climate change? This is a question that touches on the whole planet: Are we all prepared for it? Our preparedness, and our way of adapting and confronting this, will depend on how best we empower our own people. Biodiversity scientist Bibi Ameenah Firdaus Gurib-Fakim has been the president of Mauritius since June 2015. The interview was conducted by Sonya Angelica Diehn at European Development Days 2016 in Brussels. Thailand has been hit by one of the worst droughts in decades - with devastating effects on farmers. However, some small organic farms demonstrate that the key to surviving future droughts could be to embrace diversity.

{"id": null, "body": "     Whether it's heat or heavy rain, the consequences of climate change are putting our energy security at risk. Oil, gas and nuclear energy are particularly vulnerable. So what does that mean for our future? More extreme weather will increasingly threaten energy infrastructure At the end of January, torrential rains poured over parts of the South American state of Ecuador. As a result, an oil pipeline in the eastern province of Napo in the Amazon region was severely damaged \u2014 thousands of liters of oil began to\u00a0 leak out and contaminate the surrounding soil. \"The accident is a disaster for the environment,\" Hans-Joseph Fell, the founder of Energy Watch Group, which is investigating a global transition to renewable energies, told DW. \"The consequences of climate change, such as heavy rainfall or drought, have a very strong influence on the availability of conventional energy.\" Oil is particularly at risk, as the recent string of oil accidents shows. But it's not the only energy source\u00a0impacted by the increasing number of extreme weather events. During hotter months,\u00a0 nuclear power plants \u00a0sometimes have to be shut down\u00a0because\u00a0rivers are too warm to be used as cooling water. Around one million liters of oil leaked from a pipeline into the rainforest in Ecuador During the hot European summer in 2018, for example, France was forced to shut down four reactors, and the Grohnde Nuclear Power Plant in Germany almost followed suit. Nuclear power plants by the sea do not have this problem, but they in turn could be threatened by rising sea levels. Extremely low water levels in the Rhine in 2018 also caused the price of heating oil to rise sharply. Like many other goods, it was no longer possible to simply transport the oil across the entire river by ship. Extreme drought also severely damages hydropower facilities. This has global consequences.\u00a0Following long periods of extreme heat in the summer of 2021, numerous reservoirs in the US and many parts of Latin America almost dried up. The hydropower plant by Lake Mead near Las Vegas produced a quarter less electricity than usual in July. According to an analysis by the Institute of Energy Economics at the University of Cologne (EWI), lower levels of electricity generation from hydropower in Latin America led to high demand for liquefied natural gas from the US in 2021. The gas was sold on the American continent instead of to Europe, impacting the volume of gas available in Europe this winter. Meanwhile, heavy\u00a0 rain and flooding in Indonesia , severe storms in Australia and the US, as well as flooding in China, meant less coal was mined in 2021, according to the study. As a result, demand for gas \u2014 and gas prices \u2014 have risen even further. \"In contrast to fossil fuels, using wind and solar power to generate electricity is more resilient to weather extremes, and therefore more crisis-proof,\" said Tim Bachmann, who manages the clean technology fund at asset management company, DWS Group. The decentralized generation of wind \u00a0and solar energy has proven to be an advantage in extreme weather conditions, according to Bachmann. \"That's why many large companies in the US, including internet companies, carmakers and others, have signed long-term power contracts with wind and solar farm operators,\" he said. There are also far fewer logistical problems to contend with, because the electricity is directly generated from the wind and sun. Coal, oil, gas or uranium on the other hand must first be transported to power plants, where they are converted into energy. And there are various risks inherent in even just\u00a0transporting the fuels. But what about the risks posed by extreme weather when it comes to wind and solar power \u2014 for example, when hurricanes barrel into wind farms? Martin D\u00f6renk\u00e4mper,\u00a0of the Site Assessment Department at the Fraunhofer\u00a0Institute for Wind Energy Systems (IWES), explained the importance of decentralized networks, so\u00a0if turbines in the north have to go off the grid, those in other regions can compensate. \"Even in a strong winter storm, only the wind turbines at the heart\u00a0of the storm need to be shut down, but not those at the edge of the wind field,\" he told DW, adding that modern wind turbines can withstand\u00a0high speeds, and that\u00a0engineers are currently working to equip them for\u00a0winds of up to 200 kilometers per hour. He says no other great climate change adaptation measures are necessary.\u00a0In places where winters are becoming wetter as a result of global warming \u2014 such as in Scandinavia \u2014 the power plants must be heated to prevent ice from forming. During periods of heat, stronger cooling measures are necessary. Wind power is inherently resilient to climate change The risks posed by the climate crisis also seem manageable when it comes to\u00a0 solar power , according to the latest findings. In order to withstand stronger storms, the substructures and frames of future plants would need to be reinforced, as well as the glass of the solar modules. That's according to Harry Wirth, who is responsible for photovoltaic modules and power plants at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE). And it's all technically feasible. Wirth says solar power systems are also being prepared for stronger hailstorms. According to insurance company Munich Re, this risk has already significantly increased in Europe due to climate change. \"For this purpose, the modules are bombarded with artificial hail in the laboratory,\" he told DW. \"Hailstones between 2.5 and five centimeters in diameter are used.\" Whether conventional or renewable energy, it has to be transported to\u00a0where it is needed \u2014 be that to private households, municipalities or industrial companies. And that means the entire power grid must be able to withstand the risks of the climate crisis. Mathias Fischer is the press spokesperson for electricity grid operators Tennet. The group operates the entire Dutch high-voltage grid and is the largest grid operator in Germany. \"To make power grids fit for the challenges arising from the energy transition, we're increasingly relying on high-temperature conductor cables for electricity pylons,\" explained Fischer. \"They can get hotter than conventional cables without bending.\"\u00a0 \"The biggest challenge for the industry during the energy transition is to keep the frequency of the power grid constant at 50 Hertz,\" said Fischer. This is easier with conventional power plants, because they can always power up when electricity is needed and pause when there is already enough in the grid. But it becomes more complicated when dealing with many decentralized systems that generate different amounts of energy, depending on how much wind and sun is available. This means grid expansion is essential in order to transport large amounts of offshore wind power to\u00a0regions with high electricity demand. Storage possibilities for renewable energy would also need to be realized and built quickly, for example in the form of green hydrogen . This can be converted into energy whenever electricity is needed. However, renewable electricity stored in hydrogen is also more susceptible to the consequences of climate change, with storms, floods and heatwaves all posing a threat to hydrogen tanks or pipelines. This article was orignally published in German. Fabian Karthaus is one of the first farmers in Germany to grow raspberries and blueberries under photovoltaic panels. His solar field near the city of Paderborn in northwestern Germany is 0.4 hectares (about 1 acre), but he would like to expand it to 10. He could then generate enough electricity for around 4,000 households \u2014 and provide more berries for supermarkets. Up until now, many farmers have grown delicate fruits and vegetables under plastic film. But that lasts only a few years, costs money and produces a lot of plastic waste. This is one reason why ever more farmers in the Netherlands are planting under glass panels, as here in Groenleven. These protect the harvests, last for at least 30 years. And there's additional income from electricity sales. China is massively expanding photovoltaics and has also been relying on agricultural photovoltaics (agri-PVs) for several years. This plant in the northern Chinese province of Hebei has an area of more than 10 hectares, with grain growing beneath. The solar modules are manufactured nearby. This also creates jobs and helps fight poverty. Some of the largest solar parks in the world are located in the Chinese Gobi Desert, where there is plenty of space. In some places, crops are grown in the shade of the modules. This helps to stop desertification and allow soils to become arable again. This small solar roof in a field near Santiago in Chile is one of the first agri-PV systems in Latin America. Researchers are using broccoli and cauliflower to test how the system works best. The region is very sunny, and has been suffering from declining rainfall and increasing drought. Initial experience with solar shade in this field has been positive. This farmer in Rwanda earns her money with a mobile solar water pump. She pulls her panel to other farmers' fields and irrigates them from nearby water sources for a small fee. Across Africa, there is substantial potential for solar modules in agriculture. This novel arrangement is in eastern China, 150 kilometers south of Shanghai. On this lake, solar panels float on pontoons, and beneath that is a fish farm. The panels were positioned to make sure the fish get enough light. The 300 hectares of panels produce electricity for 100,000 households. Placing solar panels vertically in a field allows them to receive light from both sides. In Germany, such structures can produce as much electricity per module as roof systems. At the same time, these \"solar fences\" provide wind protection and leave plenty of space for harvesting equipment. Cultivation of corn, wheat and sugarcane for biogas and biofuel account for about 4% of global arable land use. Generating the corresponding energy with solar modules would be much cheaper \u2014 and would only need one-tenth of the arable land currently used for that.

{"id": null, "body": "     Ice ages have shaped the global environment and human evolution. A recent study indicates humans are changing these natural cycles: Our CO2 emissions are likely to postpone the next ice age. What does this mean? Ice ages occur cyclically over the Earth's history. But a recent study in \"Nature\" shows human-caused climate change will postpone the next ice age. DW talked to the lead author of the study.  DW: What determines whether and when a new ice age will occur? Andrey Ganopolski: According to astronomic theory, a new ice age should occur when the earth's orbit takes it far away from the sun, and summer is colder than usual in the northern hemisphere, at high latitudes in Canada and northern Europe. These are the areas where big ice sheets can grow. Naturally, without any human influence, we would expect the new ice age to start 50,000 years from now. But CO2 emissions affect the development of such ice sheets. Relatively large anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions - say, two to three times what we have already emitted - would, according to our model, additionally postpone the next ice age so that it would only start 100,000 years from now. So we would completely skip one glacial cycle - which has never happened in the last 3 million years.  What would this mean for the long-term development of the planet? Regular glacial cycles over the last 3 million years were extremely important, because most of the evolution of humans occurred during the last 3 million years. We are probably the product of glacial cycles, because it was probably the right conditions to increase our brainpower, because we had to be clever to survive in such a variable climate. It's believed that ice ages pushed forward human evolution For the future, it is hard to say what such a long interglacial will mean for nature. Of course, for humans it is better to live in an interglacial than a new ice age.  So why should we be concerned about this? Around 30 years ago, some scientists proposed we were very close to a new ice age. And sometimes this is used by climate skeptics to justify burning fossil fuels. Our study shows this argument is irrelevant. The ice age is not coming, anyhow. Secondly, this shows we can affect the climate for up to 100,000 years, and that's surprising to many people. They think if we stop using fossil fuels tomorrow or the day after, everything will be fine. But that's not true. The carbon dioxide will stay in the atmosphere for an extremely long time. That means we are affecting Earth's future on a geological time scale.  So are we living in the \"Anthropocene,\" i.e. an era in which not nature but humankind is determining the shape of the world we live in now and for centuries to come? Yes. I like the idea of introducing the \"Anthropocene\" as a new geological epoch. Because if you compare our current climate and rate of change to what previously happened over many millions of years, this is unprecedented. It is a substantial deviation from the natural course. Ganopolski supports calling this the Anthropocene epoch Our paper illustrates that if you continue to emit a substantial amount of carbon dioxide, the Anthropocene will last for hundreds of thousands of years before systems return to anything like \"normal\" conditions. So the earlier we stop using fossil fuels, the smaller the deviation will be from this natural state, and the earlier systems will recover.  Some people might say why worry about such a long time scale, and since the CO2 is already in the atmosphere, it doesn't matter what we do any more. How would you respond? That is not true. It does matter what we do. Our paper was also about the future of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. And what we show is that even with the CO2 concentration we have already, we can expect that a substantial fraction of these ice sheets will melt. So obviously, in this respect, any further increase of CO2 will have even more negative effects. If we add more carbon to the atmosphere, it will stay there for an even longer time, and consequences will be much more serious. I fully agree that a time scale of 50,000 years is not something of practical importance to most people. It just illustrates that our impact on climate will last for a very long time - much longer than most people think. Basically, it will affect all generations, and if we care about them, we should stop using fossil fuels as soon as possible.  Andrey Ganopolski is a physicist and earth systems modeler with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.  The interview was conducted by Irene Quaile. As leaders negotiate a climate pact, a new study calls for more ambitious targets to avoid irreversible impacts on regions of ice and snow. Otherwise water and food shortages, along with rising seas, could be inevitable.

These live updates are now closed.\u00a0To read more on how the\u00a0three-day event unfolded\u00a0 please click here . World leaders meet the Queen of England at the G7 conference in Cornwall Criticism from health and environment campaigners followed the release of the final G7 communique. \"This G7 summit will live on in infamy,\" said Max Lawson, the head of inequality policy at international aid group Oxfam. \"Faced with the biggest health emergency in a century and a climate catastrophe that is destroying our planet, they have completely failed to meet the challenges of our times.\" \u00a0 Campaigners also complained that the G7\u00a0failed to go into details about how it will pay for a newly agreed \"Nature Compact\" \u2014 aimed to protect 30% of the world's land and oceans from further destruction by 2030. Additionally, the 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses for poorer countries falls far short of the 11 billion doses the World Health Organization said is needed to vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population and truly end the pandemic. Former British prime minister Gordon Brown said the lack of a more ambitious vaccination plan was \"an unforgivable moral failure.\" International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach meanwhile thanked \"G7 leaders for their support\" for the Tokyo games that were postponed for a year \u00a0due to the coronavirus pandemic. \"We take this as a great encouragement to deliver safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 for everybody in this spirit of worldwide solidarity,\" Bach said. US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden visited the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, following the end of the three-day G7 summit. The Bidens emerged from a Land Rover on Sunday to meet the awaiting queen before inspecting the Guard of Honor assembled on the castle grounds. US President Joe Biden and US First Lady Jill Biden headed to Windsor Castle to meet the British monarch The queen and the US first lady stayed on a dais as Biden walked along the guard. Once Sunday's inspection was completed, the queen and the Bidens headed into the castle for tea. Following the visit, Biden said \"I don't think she'll be insulted, but she reminded me of my mother.\" US President Joe Biden inspected the Guard of Honor during a visit to Windsor Castle US President Joe Biden said his fellow leaders agreed that \"America is back at the table and fully engaged,\" following a period of \"America First\" protectionist policy under former president Donald Trump. Here's a roundup G7 leaders' comments on Biden at the summit. A \"big breath of fresh air\" is how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, host of the summit in southwest England, described Biden, He told reporters Sunday that the G7 stood united anew in its \"democratic values.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel, attending her last G7 in the post, meanwhile said Biden had brought \"new momentum\" to resolving the world's problems at the three-day summit. French President Macron and US counterpart Biden hit it off during the G7 summit French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that it was a relief that he was now working with an American president who he termed was \"willing to cooperate.\" \"What you demonstrate is leadership is partnership,\" Macron said of Biden. Macron and Biden appeared to have built up quick chemistry during the in-person summit. The two draped their arms around each other and chatted animatedly when they walked together after the leaders' photo on Friday. US President Joe Biden said democracies were \"in a contest with autocratic governments around the world\" in his final address at the G7 conference. \"We're in a contest, not with China per se, ... with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in a rapidly changing 21st century,\" said Biden. He indicated Russia had its own problems to \"chew on,\" saying its president, Vladimir Putin, had not changed. \"Let me make it clear I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which in many cases he has not,\" Biden told reporters. The US president also stressed that his country was making a comeback in international diplomacy, following Trump. \"America's back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values,'' Biden said, before leaving Cornwall to visit Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. \"I think we've made progress in reestablishing American credibility among our closest friends.\" Biden said he does not view NATO as a \"protection racket.\" Trump had often criticized European member states for what he viewed as too low financial contributions to the organization. Biden also reported that global leaders were gratified that he accepted the science of climate change: \"One of the things some of my colleagues said to me when I was there was, 'Well, the United States' leadership recognizes there is global warming,''' Biden said. The final communique from the G7 meeting has been released to some media outlets.\u00a0 The document covers several topics On the coronavirus, the document: On climate change\u00a0and environment it: Pledges\u00a0to meet\u00a0$100 billion a year overdue funding to help poorer countries tackle climate change On Russia, the document: On other human rights issues, it: On China, it: On global economic issues, it: G7 leaders said in their draft communique that China must respect human rights in Xinjiang as well as allow Hong Kong freedoms. The group also expressed concern over what it called Beijing's growing influence in the East and South China Seas, and in the Taiwan Strait. \"We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,\" the\u00a0G7\u00a0said in the\u00a0communique that was almost finalized. Leaders also expressed concern over forced labor in China.\u00a0 \"The United States and our G7 partners remain deeply concerned by the use of all forms of forced labor in global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor of vulnerable groups and minorities and supply chains of the agricultural, solar, and garment sectors \u2014 the main supply chains of concern in Xinjiang,\" the document said. DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says G7\u00a0leaders have agreed to increase their financial support \"to make sure that they will be able to mobilize \u20ac100 billion for poorer nations to cope with the coincidences of climate change and to help them switch to clean energy.\"\u00a0 \"However, this promise was already made a decade ago and so far the leaders have not managed to live up to their promises,\" von Nahmen told DW.\u00a0Therefore, they are \"now saying they are definitely going to increase financial spending,\" she added. G7 leaders called for a\u00a0transparent, science-based study into the origins of COVID-19 convened by the World Health Organization, according to the draft communique.\u00a0 \"We\u00a0call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 COVID-19 Origins study including, as recommended by the experts\u2019 report, in\u00a0China,\" it said.\u00a0 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hopes that a new G7 task force can present details of the first infrastructure projects in developing countries in 2022. She also said that 2.3 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses should be distributed to low-income countries by\u00a0the end of next year. \"Germany is responsible for 350 million doses,\"\u00a0Merkel\u00a0said.\u00a0That includes 30 million doses that Germany had ordered and would distribute, she said. \"That will probably be more over time.\"\u00a0 The\u00a0G7\u00a0group has \"agreed that the pandemic can only be defeated globally,\" she said. \"The way out of the pandemic is vaccines,\" she stressed.\u00a0 Speaking about coal, for which the G7 leaders\u00a0are facing pressure to phase out state subsidies, Merkel said\u00a0the delegates had not\u00a0agreed on a date for ending the use of\u00a0the fossil fuel. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has joined the summit for its last day, urged the G7\u00a0to help finance the World Health Organization's\u00a0program\u00a0to increase COVID-19 testing, diagnostics and vaccines. \"We need to address the substantial financing gap for tests, treatments, critical supplies like oxygen and the health systems that enable testing, treatment and vaccination,\" Ramaphosa said in the presidency statement, referring to the\u00a0Access to the COVID-19 Tools Accelerator.\u00a0 \"If all\u00a0G7\u00a0countries met their fair share target, this initiative\u00a0would be two-thirds funded \u2013 and it would be 90% funded if all G20 countries made their fair share contributions,\" Ramaphosa said. G7 countries will provide one\u00a0billion COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next year and work with the private sector\u00a0and other countries to increase the contribution over the next months, according to a communique draft. \"The commitments since we last met in February 2021 including here in Carbis Bay provide for one\u00a0billion doses over the next year,\" the communique said. \"We will work together with the private sector, the G20 and other countries to increase this contribution over the months to come,\" it added. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lauded the vaccine pledge but said it's not enough. He said at least 11 billion doses are needed to\u00a0 vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population \u00a0by the middle of next year. \"We need more and we need them faster,'' Tedros said. DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says climate policy is a \"top priority\" for G7 countries. Speaking from Cornwall, England, where the G7 summit is taking place, von Nahmen\u00a0says leaders are expected to discuss the phasing out of diesel and patrol cars as well as ending the use of coal \"as soon as possible.\" She\u00a0added that the leaders are unlikely to specify a deadline. \u00a0 Concerning\u00a0relations between the West and China, von Nahmen said:\u00a0\"The US is pushing and hoping for a united front to counter China's rise,\" with European countries being \"very cautious not to push it too far to the extent that it would prevent any cooperation with China.\" \"What we expect from the (final) communique is to strike a balance, to stress that it is important to work on global issues with Beijing such as climate change,\" she said,\u00a0adding that the G7 would also be expected to \"call out China for human rights abuses\" and that the Chinese government should \"use fair methods to compete with western economies.\" Oxfam activists get creative at a climate protest at Swanpool Beach near Falmouth during the G7 summit The heads of state\u00a0plan to commit to steps to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources. The US, Germany, Britain and Canada say they intend to provide developing countries with up to $2 billion (\u20ac1.65 billion) to accelerate their phase-out of\u00a0coal. A White House statement also said that the\u00a0G7\u00a0would coordinate climate targets so that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as outlined in the Paris climate agreement\u00a0\u2014\u00a0remains \"within reach.\" British naturalist Sir David Attenborough is to\u00a0address\u00a0the G7 delegates by video link, warning that countries must take urgent action to avoid human-made environmental disasters. In remarks released ahead of his speech, Attenborough said global warming and loss of biodiversity are \"beyond doubt,\" as is the fact that \"our societies and nations are unequal.\" \"The question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether, as a result of these intertwined facts, we are on the verge of destabilizing the entire planet.\" \"If that is so, then the decisions we make this decade, in particular the decisions made by the most economically advanced nations, are the most important in human history,\" Attenborough added. The third and final day of the G7 summit takes\u00a0place in Cornwall, England, on Sunday. The UK wants to use the summit to coordinate global climate targets and persuade world leaders to agree on tougher climate measures, such as the phasing out of coal. The heads of state and government\u00a0will discuss steps on how to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources as well as how to\u00a0accelerate the phase-out of\u00a0coal. mvb/mm (AP, Reuters, dpa) The US leads efforts to create a western alternative to China's New Silk Road project, but the EU is wary of setting up an anti-China coalition.

{"id": null, "body": "     Did you know it's possible to take legal action to fight global warming?\u00a0Ever more citizens are doing just that. Here are four landmark climate change lawsuits with significant decisions pending in 2018. Citizens around the world are taking climate action to the courtroom by\u00a0 suing their own governments and some of the world's biggest oil and energy companies over failing to protect against the risks and consequences of\u00a0climate change. According to a survey by the United Nations Environment Program and Columbia Law School , climate change lawsuits are on the increase \u2014\u00a0with nearly 900 cases in 24 countries as of March last year \u2014\u00a0and courts will play a greater role to in the fight against global warming over\u00a0the year to come. Here are four\u00a0high-profile climate lawsuits to watch in 2018\u00a0\u2014 each is likely to make waves by\u00a0setting a possible legal precedent in pressuring governments and companies to take responsibility over climate change. Citizens vs. the government of the Netherlands Plaintiffs wait for the verdict in Netherlands climate lawsuit It\u00a0started with a precedent-setting climate lawsuit in the summer of 2015, when 900 Dutch citizens, represented by the Urgenda Foundation, took their government to court to cut greenhouse gas emissions nationwide.\u00a0 This was the first time a group of citizens sued their own government over climate change action \u2014\u00a0and won. The lawsuit resulted in a Dutch court ordering\u00a0the government to cut greenhouse gas emissions nationwide by at least 25 percent by the year of 2020 (compared to 1990 levels), forcing it to take more measures against climate change. \"The state must do more to avert the imminent danger caused by climate change, also in view of its duty of care to protect and improve the living environment,\" the verdict read . The landmark ruling is the first case in which regular citizens have managed to hold their government accountable for taking insufficient action to fight global warming. It is also the only case in the world thus far to define a government's obligation to control climate change. While the Dutch government has taken concrete steps, such as announcing a coal exit , it is also\u00a0appealing the verdict, and a first hearing is scheduled for May\u00a02018. The Dutch landmark case laid the foundations for similar lawsuits around the world, for instance by a group of Belgian artists, filmmakers and rock stars, who are suing the Belgian government to increase\u00a0its climate change game, and make deeper greenhouse gas emission cuts. Youth vs. the government of the United States Scientist James Hansen (right) with his granddaughter, who is among US youth suing their government over climate change Another lawsuit inspired by the Dutch court case was started by a group of American youths, who are suing the US government for failing to curb climate change. The 21 plaintiffs, who are between 10 and 21 years old, and come from all over the US,\u00a0 filed the climate change lawsuit\u00a0 together with their attorneys and climate scientist James Hansen in 2015. All the kids and teenagers in the plaintiff group have been personally impacted by climate change. Some of them live on farms being affected by drought, while others have lost their homes due to floods, or face health issues due to forest fires. In the unprecedented lawsuit, entitled \"Juliana vs. US,\"\u00a0the youth accuse the federal government of\u00a0violating the younger generations'\u00a0constitutional rights to life and liberty by failing to take action against global warming. They argue that the government is failing\u00a0to protect essential public trust resources like air and water, which\u00a0are vital to survival. \"Our role as plaintiffs is to show them the personal harm climate change is causing. We represent the children \u2014\u00a0not just of this nation, but of the entire world,\"\u00a020-year-old student Tia Hatton\u00a0told DW. \"We are all very worried about our future, health and safety from the climate change impacts that we're seeing already, and that will worsen as time goes on,\" said the plaintiff in the lawsuit. An initial\u00a0ruling \u00a0in an Oregon district court\u00a0upheld their main argument that\u00a0\"the government has known for more than 50 years that the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels was destabilizing the climate system in a way that would significantly endanger plaintiffs, with the damage persisting for millennia.\" Wildfire is among the impacts of climate change more strongly felt in recent years in the US Yet, the court case\u00a0argues,\u00a0the government has failed to take action, making it responsible for some of the harm caused by climate change. Since then, the landmark court case has been the target of strong opposition from lobby\u00a0groups, the fossil fuel industry, and the US government, which sought\u00a0for the case to be thrown out. The US government has even asked\u00a0a federal appeals court to block the lawsuit, claiming it could lead \"to a constitutional crisis.\" But motions for\u00a0appeal were denied and the lawsuit\u00a0was ruled valid \u00a0by\u00a0US District Judge Ann Aiken. She wrote in her ruling:\u00a0\"This lawsuit may be groundbreaking, but the fact does not alter the legal standards governing the motions to dismiss. [...]\u00a0Federal courts too often have been cautious and overly deferential in the arena of environment law, and the world has suffered for it.\" The case will\u00a0now officially go\u00a0to trial in February 2018. Peruvian farmer vs. German energy company RWE Peruvian farmer Sa\u00fal Lliuya ia taking on German energy company RWE over greenhouse gas emissions Not just governments are facing legal challenges over climate \u2014 also a\u00a0Peruvian farmer and mountain guide is suing German energy firm RWE . He is claiming that the company's contribution to climate change is threatening his home, and is asking RWE to take on financial responsibility for the damage. Sa\u00fal Lliuya from Huaraz, a city located in the Andean Mountains in western Peru, says his family and a large part of the city are facing\u00a0catastrophic flooding as global warming melts a nearby glacier. RWE's coal power emissions contribute to around 0.5 percent of global climate change, so the company should have to pay around half a percent of the measures required for protecting Lliyua's home and the area, says the plaintiff, who is being supported by environmental organization\u00a0Germanwatch. The farmer is asking for \u20ac17,000 ($20,000) from RWE, which would go toward\u00a0funding flood defenses he plans to install for his community, as well as a further \u20ac6,384 in reimbursement for money he's already spent out of his own pocket on protective measures. RWE says the case has no legal basis, and that the alleged danger of flooding has never\u00a0been sufficiently demonstrated. The company further argues that emitting CO2\u00a0is not illegal, as RWE has authorization under carbon emissions trading laws.\u00a0 Plus, RWE says climate change is a global problem that has to be solved on a state and international level, meaning\u00a0individual companies should not be held responsible.\u00a0 But a German court decided that Lliuya's allegations had merit and ruled to proceed with the case,\u00a0which is due to hear evidence in 2018. It is the first time a German civil court has been asked to rule on whether a company can be held financially responsible for its contribution to the effects of climate change in other parts of the world.\u00a0 ExxonMobil\u00a0vs. US state attorneys Oil multinational ExxonMobil is accused of covering up research over climate change for decades In the US, a similar case is coming to a head this year: the first-ever US legal action aimed at holding the oil giant ExxonMobil accountable for its climate change coverup. The American multinational oil gas corporation\u00a0is being sued over failing to safeguard Massachusetts communities against pollution relating to climate change impacts, and lying to the public about the risks of climate change. The suit was started by a group of state attorneys general , led by New York's Eric Schneiderman, after it came to light that Exxon executives had been aware of the climate risks associated with fossil fuels as early as 1977, but launched a campaign to cover up those findings. According to the lawsuit, ExxonMobil endangered communities by ignoring the threat posed by severe weather events and rising sea levels to its Everett facility along the Mystic River in Massachusetts \u2014\u00a0despite its long-held knowledge of the risks associated with climate change. ExxonMobil has denied the claims, and said in a statement it would fight the lawsuit in court. A verdict is expected in 2018. Countries such as India, France and the United Kingdom have pledged to move away from gas and diesel cars in favor of less-polluting options, such as electric vehicles. Even China, the world's largest car market, is developing a plan to ban the production and sale of vehicles that rely purely on fossil fuels. 2018 could be an important year in the shift toward cleaner transportation. Bees are among the world's greatest pollinators and help plants to reproduce. They play a vital role for the Earth's ecosystem \u2014 but they're struggling to survive. Insecticides called neonicotinoids have been identified as a major threat, but the European Commission has proposed a complete ban of three of the most harmful neonicotinoids. There is still much work to do, but it's a first step. The move to phase out coal has been at the forefront of environmental protests this year in countries that still largely rely on the fuel, like Germany. Several EU members have pledged to eliminate the use of coal for power by 2030 at the latest. All of the EU national energy companies \u2014 except for Poland and Greece \u2014 have agreed that no new coal-fired plants will be built in the EU after 2020. In 2017, more than 200 countries promised to join their efforts to end marine plastic pollution, one of the world's biggest environmental problems. UN member states have pledged to take action to prevent the spread of marine litter and microplastics. At the same time, the EU has agreed on stricter regulations regarding e-waste and planned obsolescence. Donald Trump's constant attacks on climate have had some positive effects. How? By motivating people and companies across the US to stand up and pledge to act at the local level. At the COP23 climate conference in November, California Governor Jerry Brown maintained the president's decisions won't stop US citizens from fighting climate change. Massive marches against Trump's measures were proof. French President Emmanuel Macron has boosted the fight against climate change in Europe. His actions might be symbolic, but they are bringing environmental topics to the fore. He has given grants to 18 climate scientists \u2014 Americans in particular \u2014 to move their work to France for between three to five years, in defiance of Trump's anti-climate stance. Millions of people are making positive changes in their daily lives that never make the headlines. These small actions lead to bigger ones \u2014 and can lead to significant progress. A few examples: on Fiji's Mamanuca Islands, a coral growing project is improving the health of coral reefs, while conservation groups in Niger are pushing to establish a protected area for endangered giraffes. The first Conservation Optimism Summit, held in the UK in April, celebrated success stories. Participants were reminded, for instance, that lynxes are successfully being reintroduced in Central Europe, or that the tiger population has increased in India for the first time in a century. Faced with global challenges, the summit's goal is to \"create a positive vision for the future.\" Author: Irene Banos Ruiz A German court has ruled \"admissible\" a Peruvian farmer's claims that energy giant RWE's contributions to climate change threaten his Andean home.

{"id": null, "body": "     Conservative Christians have long opposed climate science, saying human induced warming goes against God\u2019s omnipotence. Opinions divide on whether that thinking might slowly be changing. When Reverend Mitchell Hescox organized an environmental stewardship conference for evangelical Christians in Missouri in 2014, only five people showed up. This past September, he said, the same conference attracted 500 attendees. \"We're seeing a remarkable changing of the times,\" Hescox told DW, adding that although many evangelicals are still dismissive of global warming , \"a growing number are \"getting behind climate science.\" Read more : Climate change: 'Fake news,' real fallout Hescox is also president and CEO of the Evangelical Environment Network (EEN), one of the largest evangelical groups in the US. Ten years ago, it had some 25,000 members, now it comprises \"4 million pro-life Christians.\" For more than two decades, the EEN has been educating members to care for everything it believes to have been created by God. One of its main missions has been convincing evangelicals to recognize climate change as something that's increasingly impacting their own lives . \"Climate change isn't just about polar bears. It's about our children's health. It's about our life now and in the future,\" Hescox said, adding that it poses several risks in the US. The air over Los Angeles Apart from the increased frequency of extreme weather events , the Washington D.C.-based Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says rising temperatures in the Midwest and eastern US have\u00a0caused a rapid increase\u00a0 in the population of ticks that can transmit Lyme disease. \u00a0\u00a0 In addition, findings from the University of Washington in Seattle suggest corn production could fall by around 50 percent by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked;\u00a0and the American Lung Association says higher levels of CO2 are also contributing to lung disease and respiratory problems. Why climate policy hinges on evangelical support According to a 2015 Pew Research poll , more than a quarter of the US population identifies as evangelical or born-again Christian, people who generally interpret the bible literally and\u00a0tend to be very socially conservative. Largely white and transdenominational, they're much more likely to be Republican than\u00a0Democrat. A different Pew poll in 2016 found that 81 percent of evangelicals and born-again Christians voted for President Donald Trump. Though, in large part, that trend\u00a0could be attributed to his stance on\u00a0abortion and gun control, he also used his campaign to tap into a long tradition of Republican antipathy to environmental issues . And since taking up office, he has pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement , which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.\u00a0 This January, however,\u00a0 an NPR/PBS/Marist survey found\u00a0only 66 percent of white evangelicals now approve of Trump's presidency, down from a 73 percent\u00a0rating in December. Read more :\u00a0 Trump's wall poses serious threat to endangered wildlife The drop in support comes after the longest partial government shutdown in US history, the separation of migrant families at the US-Mexican border, and as Trump continues to deny global warming even though a clear\u00a0majority of Republicans \u00a0currently acknowledge it\u00a0is happening. At the end of last year, the president went on record saying he didn't believe his own government's findings on the potential economic impacts of unchecked emissions. Are opinions shifting? Changing evangelicals' minds, Hescox says, could have a significant impact on advancing environment-friendly climate policies. Though he concedes they aren't about to jump to the Democratic Party, he believes they are now more likely to pressure their Republican representatives to adopt a more forward approach to the problem. President Trump blamed the fire that devastated the Californian town of Paradise last year, on forest mismanagment Katharine Hayhoe, an evangelical, atmospheric scientist and political science professor at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, also says she sees attitudes changing. She says this could have something to do with certain solutions proving\u00a0business-friendly. \"There's been a massive expansion of clean energy across the middle of the country. We have 30,000 jobs in Texas with solar energy,\" she said. \"Very conservative farmers, who would rather cut off their arms than let the government impose regulations on carbon emissions, now have wind turbines on their land. And a check arrives in the mail. So they're like, 'oh, ok, there's no problem with that.'\" But David Konisky, associate professor at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University , says he sees no sign of evangelicals budging on climate policy. On the contrary. Read more :\u00a0 Donald Trump picks climate change skeptic Kelly Craft for UN post \"My analysis of US Gallup public opinion polls does not indicate any widespread 'greening of Christianity' among evangelical Protestants or other Christian denominations,\" he said in an interview with DW. \"Over the time period I studied (around 2000-2015), there is evidence of declining levels of environmental concern.\" The beliefs behind climate change denial This dismissal of climate science could be explained in a number of ways, says Kyle Meyaard-Schaap, National Organizer and Spokesperson for Young Evangelicals for Climate Action (YECA), a group that has been educating younger people on how just much the Bible talks about caring for the environment. While some see global warming as part of God's plan or even as a sign of the end of the world, as prophesied in the book of Revelation, others point to a passage in the book of Genesis that says humans should have \"dominion\" over the Earth. The interpretation of \"dominion\" has historically divided Christians into those who interpret it\u00a0as the need for\u00a0God's followers to take responsible stewardship of\u00a0Earth, and those who understand it as humans having\u00a0absolute command over all things on the planet. Read more :\u00a0 How right-wing nationalism fuels climate denial Evangelicals have also contributed to the growing partisan divide in the US in recent decades, Meyaard-Schaap explained, and have historically opposed climate science out of a fear of liberal government solutions. \"Climate change has effectively been polarized. Many Christians in the US have come to the conclusion that supporting climate action must also mean supporting other liberal and socially economic positions,\" he said, in reference to issues such as\u00a0abortion rights and same sex marriage. \"This would mean betraying their values and turning their backs on their communities.\" The Camp Fire was the deadliest wildfire in the USA in 100 years and the world's costliest natural disaster in 2018. On November 8, the fire took light and spread incredibly quickly due to a range of factors, including high winds. By the time it reached the town of Paradise, many, including those who tried to escape in their cars (above), did not have enough time to escape the flames. The wildfire destroyed most of Paradise, a town with a population of 26,000. Much of the adjacent Magalia, Butte Creek Canyon, and Concow communities were also destroyed. On the day the fire began, Scott McLean, a California Fire Captain, said, \"We're talking devastated. The town center is completely on the ground. The south side as well as the north side has been hit very hard as well.\" Shane Grammer, an artist from the nearby town of Chico, went to Paradise on New Year's Eve and painted a mural of a woman on a friend's chimney \u2014 all that was left of the house \u2014 in a part of the town that had been destroyed by the blaze. \"When my buddy Shane posted photos, the only thing standing was his chimney, it was perfect,\" said Grammer. \"I was like, 'I gottta paint that chimney.'\" \"I wanted to paint something that brought hope in the middle of complete destruction,\" Grammer wrote. Residents of the town were so moved by the artistic expression on the chimney that several survivors of the fire asked the artist to come back and paint more. So he did, painting images on whatever free-standing structures he could find among the ruins. Grammer always gets permission from whoever owns the structure before painting on it. His murals are almost exclusively of people, some of whom died in the fire, and others who survived. \"I\u2019m happy to be a small part of bringing hope and joy to this community and to these people who have gone through so much,\" he said. Described as a \"worst case scenario\" event by Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea, some attributed the severity of the fire to the gradual buildup of the effects of climate change. US President Donald Trump was not one of them. He blamed the fire on California forest management. Daniel Swain, who works at the University of California-Los Angeles\u2019 Center for Climate Science, wrote the following: \"If Northern California had received anywhere near the typical amount of autumn precipitation this year (around 4-5 inches of rain near #CampFire point of origin), explosive fire behavior & stunning tragedy in #Paradise would almost certainly not have occurred.\" Grammer's work in Paradise serves as a reminder that even after such a devastating event as the Camp Fire, beauty can bloom again. It also serves a more pointed purpose of memorial, as seen in this image, of a mural showing a woman who lost her life in the fire.

{"id": null, "body": "     Even if the Paris agreement is successfully implemented, the planet could still heat up by 5 degrees Celsius, scientists warn. This \"hothouse\" climate would make parts of the world uninhabitable. A joint study by international climate scientists from Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Australia presents a bleak prognosis: Even if the goals of the Paris climate agreement are achieved and global warming is limited to maxiumum\u00a02 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial levels, the climate system could still pass\u00a0a devastating tipping point. \"Human emissions of greenhouse gas are not the sole determinant of temperature on Earth,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Will Steffen, lead author of the study and climate researcher at the Australian National University and the Swedish research institute Stockholm Resilience Centre. \"Our study suggests that human-induced global warming of 2 degrees Celsius\u00a0may trigger other Earth system processes, often called 'feedbacks,' that can drive further warming \u2014 even if we stop emitting greenhouse gases,\" he said. The global average temperature in such a\u00a0case would in the long term settle between 4 to 5 degrees warmer compared to pre-industrial levels, their study found. Sea levels would rise 10 to 60 meters (33 to 197 feet), flooding numerous islands and coastal cities such as Venice, New York, Tokyo and Sydney. Such major population centers\u00a0would have to be abandoned. Scientists call this a \"hothouse Earth\" climate scenario.

And Portugal has been having plenty of it, as the Iberian Peninsula bakes in warmth coming over from North Africa. The country has already had near-record temperatures this year, but nothing yet to break the 47.3\u00b0 C (117.1\u00b0 F) recorded in 2003 in Amareleja. Still, large parts are on red alert. Fountains, like this one in Rossio Square in Lisbon, provide welcome relief from the heat. Portugal is not just experiencing a heat wave, but also clouds of dust coming from the Sahara Desert that are tingeing the sky dark yellow in some places. In neighboring Spain, the mercury is also soaring and heat warnings have been issued. Three people are reported to have died from heat-related causes in the past week. Authorities are warning people to shelter from the sun and drink plenty of fluids, advice heeded by this man in Madrid. Despite its northerly location in Europe, much of Germany has been experiencing an unusually long run of high temperatures, accompanied by much less rainfall than usual. Farmers have requested financial aid from the government to help them cope with greatly reduced harvests. The heat in Germany has caused the waters in the Rhine River to drop dramatically leaving parts of the riverbed dry, as seen here in D\u00fcsseldorf. Freight vessels are being forced to reduce their cargoes if they want to continue sailing on the river. In the Austrian capital, Vienna, asphalt in the city has become too hot for police dogs' paws, so the force has come up with the logical response: specially made dog shoes. The working dog shown here, Spike, seems as alert as ever and completely unfazed by his new item of uniform. Sweden has had its hottest July of the past 260 years. The high temperatures have led to a high fire danger, and wildfires in the country have extended even into the Arctic Circle. But these city dwellers in central Stockholm seem intent on seeing the bright side of the hot weather as they laze at the Tantolunden bathing place. In Britain, the unusually long summer has taken its toll on lawns and plants across the country. Fire authorities have warned that parks and other grasslands are like a tinderbox after a July that was the country's third-warmest month in more than a century. Greenwich Park in London, seen here, seems to be no exception. But relief can been found even in central London, as seen here in a fountain at Trafalgar Square. Retailers are also suffering, groaning not just about the heat but also over decreased sales: Accountancy firm BDO said figures were down 1.1 percent in July. \"The scorching conditions did not encourage physical shopping and only hindered footfall in shops,\" BDO's Sophie Michael said. North Korea has called for an \"all-out battle\" against record temperatures, with crops damaged amid the prolonged heat wave. Poor harvests could hit hard in a country that is already struggling under international sanctions over its nuclear arms program. North Korea also lacks irrigation systems and other infrastructure to cope with drought. These men in Pyongyang transporting an electric fan have obviously adopted one of the cheapest, yet most effective, ways of countering heat: the humble electric fan. They seem not to believe a widespread South Korean myth: that fans can cause death if left on while someone is asleep. The fact is, of course, that people are much more likely to die from the heat without one running. Author: Timothy Jones Climate\u00a0domino effect In the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the international research team analyzed the complete climate system of a 2-degree warmer world across several models. Interactions and chain reactions among melting glaciers, thawing permafrost, bacteria in the oceans and weakened carbon sinks were discovered. Read more: \u00a0 When nature harms itself \u2014\u00a0five scary climate feedback loops As a result of these feedback processes and tipping points that lead to abrupt changes in the climate system, forests and permafrost transform themselves from \"friends\" that store CO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane into \"enemies\" that uncontrollably release stored emissions into the atmosphere. As such, the individual feedback processes could\u00a0potentially snowball, explained\u00a0Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre and incoming co-director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). Extreme weather is one consequence of climate change that is becoming ever more palpable \"These tipping elements can potentially act like a row of dominos. Once one is pushed over, it pushes Earth toward\u00a0another. It may be very difficult or impossible to stop the whole row of dominoes from tumbling over,\" he said. The Earth would then warm at an accelerating tempo \u2014 even if humans stopped producing greenhouse gases entirely. \"Places on Earth will become uninhabitable if 'hothouse Earth' becomes the reality,\"\u00a0Rockstr\u00f6m added.

That is in no way to say that the Paris climate agreement is\u00a0futile and should be abandoned \u2014 as United States President Donald Trump did\u00a0in June 2017 when\u00a0he pulled\u00a0the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter out of the deal. Trump referred to a tiny temperature increase when he announced US withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate agreement \"Fully implementing the Paris climate agreement by following a path of rapid decarbonization through socio-economic transformation minimizes the risk of triggering self-amplifying climate change,\" Jonathan Donges, a PIK researcher and co-author of the study, told DW. He said\u00a0that meeting the Paris goals \u2014 or even better, aiming for a more ambitious target \u2014 remains \"the best-known strategy to minimize the risk of triggering self-reinforcing feedbacks in the Earth system that could lead to a hothouse climate state.\" To avoid a potential chain reaction, much more needs to be done than just reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the researchers point out. Humanity must protect the ecosystem as a whole;\u00a0create more natural carbon sinks;\u00a0stop deforestation;\u00a0consume less;\u00a0control population growth;\u00a0invest in technologies that extract CO2 from the atmosphere;\u00a0and much more. For Donges, such \"stewardship\" of the Earth will also require \"transformed social values.\" Read more: \u00a0\u00a0 Earth Overshoot Day: Time for a radical rethink 'Positive message' Despite the study's apocalyptic findings, co-author Katherine Richardson of the University of Copenhagen said they are\u00a0not trying\u00a0to present\u00a0a hopeless doomsday scenario. \"I think our study\u00a0has an incredible positive message,\" she told DW, adding that\u00a0real action on climate change requires increased awareness of its potential effects.\u00a0 \"What we are really doing is understanding ever better our role in the Earth's system, and acting accordingly,\"\u00a0Richardson added. \"We would be screwed if we didn't recognize the fact that we are just not doing enough.\" Unprecedented heat waves swept across the globe in 2017, leading to droughts, wildfires and even deaths. Australia started the year with temperatures near 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), the \"Lucifer\" heat wave brought the mercury above 40 degrees Celsius throughout Southern Europe in July and August and scorching heat hit India's most vulnerable people. Get ready for next summer... Earlier this year, scientists realized that coral bleaching in Australia's Great Barrier Reef was worse than first thought. In some parts of the UNESCO World Heritage site, up to 70 percent of the coral has already been killed. By 2050, scientists have warned 90 percent of the reef could disappear. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are the main culprits. Armed conflicts are pushing millions of people to leave their homes or live in terribly precarious situations \u2014 and climate change is making it worse. A lack of natural resources increases the risk of conflict and makes life even harder for refugees. South Sudanese families, for instance, are escaping to neighboring countries like Uganda and Kenya \u2014 countries already suffering from drought. From New Zealand to Spain, from California to even Greenland: the world has seen a nonstop year of wildfires. Global warming has been blamed for the increased fire risk, and in some countries that risk has turned into reality. Wildfires engulfed large areas of Europe's Iberian Peninsula, causing death and destruction, while firefighters in California have had no rest for more than six months. Hurricanes Maria and Irma, which hit the Caribbean region in August and September, were two of the year's most damaging weather events. The list of deadly storms also included Ophelia in Ireland, Harvey and Nate in Central America and the US, and Xavier and Sebastian in Germany. Warming of the ocean surface has led to more evaporation, and that water may help fuel thunderstorms and hurricanes. In July, one of the largest icebergs ever recorded separated from the Larsen C ice shelf \u2014 one of Antarctica's biggest \u2014 reducing its area by more than 12 percent. While calving icebergs in the Antarctic are part of a natural cycle, scientists have linked the retreat of several Antarctic ice shelves to global warming and are closely monitoring potential long-term effects. Deteriorating air quality causes thousands of deaths around the world every year. India's capital, New Delhi, is one of the world's most polluted cities. In November, large parts of northern India and Pakistan were engulfed by a blanket of thick smog carrying harmful particulate matter. Schools were forced to close, and hospitals were full of people with respiratory problems. The high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere represent a major threat for our oceans, already in danger due to plastic pollution, overfishing and warming waters. Ocean acidification could make these waters \u2014 covering more than two-thirds of our planet's surface \u2014 a hostile environment for sea creatures. And without marine animals, entire ocean ecosystems are at risk. Superstorms often trigger flash floods and mudslides. In late December, more than 230 people were killed when a storm hit the Philippines' second-largest island of Mindanao, a tragedy exacerbated by years of deforestation. In 2017, severe floods also hit countries such as Vietnam, Peru and Sierra Leone. European countries, including Greece and Germany, also felt the damaging effects of heavy rain.

Global fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the power and industry sectors are at the same level as in 2019 The UN released a report on Thursday warning that the COVID-19 pandemic has not slowed the pace of climate change. Virus-related economic slowdown and lockdowns caused only a temporary downturn in CO2 emissions last year, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said. \"There was some thinking that the COVID lockdowns would have had a positive impact on the\u00a0atmosphere, which is not the case,\" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said at a news briefing. The United in Science 2021 report ,\u00a0which gathers the latest scientific data and findings related to climate change, said\u00a0global fossil-fuel CO2 emissions between January and July in the power and industry sectors were already back to the same level or higher than in the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. \"This is a critical year for climate action,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, saying the results were an \"alarming appraisal of just how far off course we are.\" The WMO said that emissions reductions during the first COVID-19 wave in early 2020 represented a \"brief lapse.\" \u00a0 \"Overall emissions reductions in 2020 likely reduced the annual increase of the atmospheric concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases, but this effect was too small to be distinguished from natural variability,\" the report concluded. Although CO2 emissions from road traffic in 2021 have been below the levels before the pandemic outbreak, concentrations of the major greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming continued to increase, according to the report. \u00a0 \"We are still significantly off- schedule to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.\u00a0 \"Unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale \u00a0\u00a0 reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to 1.5C \u00a0 will be impossible, with catastrophic consequences for people \u00a0 and the planet on which we depend.\" Guterres said. jcg/sms (dpa, Reuters) \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "UN: Pandemic did not slow advance of climate change", "article_name": "un-pandemic-did-not-slow-advance-of-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/un-pandemic-did-not-slow-advance-of-climate-change/a-59197095", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 2284, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:04:00.902933"}
{"id": null, "body": "     This summer's devastating floods in western Germany hit some of the country's most-popular holiday spots. Experts say the sector must change quickly or pay the price. Flooding severely damaged Germany's Eifel region in July Before devastating floods swept across western Germany in mid-July, killing 184\u00a0people, Germany\u2019s Ahr valley was a popular destination for wine lovers and hikers. But now, there is little left for tourists to explore:\u00a0Vineyards have been destroyed, trails and roads have been washed away. It will take years for tourism in the region to recover. The flooding could be a wakeup call for other touristic regions in Germany to adapt to climate change \u2014\u00a0or suffer the consequences. Climate change is real and can be illustrated by facts and figures, according to Peter Hoffmann of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). \"Droughts that last for years or devastating floods are already happening much more frequently today than predicted twenty or thirty years ago,\" he says. Even Germany, which until recently has been largely spared of such extreme weather, will in the future be affected more often by heavy rains, heat waves or storms. Yet it's impossible to predict exactly where\u00a0 natural disasters will take place . Climate change is gaining momentum, as illustrated by rising average annual temperatures, explains Hoffmann. Globally, the average annual temperature has already increased more than\u00a01 degree Celsius (around 3 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0relative to pre-industrial times. In Germany, this is 1.6 C higher. \"In recent years, the development has accelerated, so we can assume that 1 degree Celsius will be added every 30 years,\" says Hoffmann. That's why, he adds, it is important to act now.\u00a0\"The measures we take today will have an effect in 30 years' time.\" Extreme flooding in western Germany devastated the tourism industry in the region The German Tourism Association (DTV)\u00a0has long been committed to helping tourism destinations adapt to climate change, emphasizes DTV deputy managing director Dirk Dunkelberg. \"The DTV has been promoting sustainability for 30 years \u2014\u00a0back then, it was called 'soft tourism.' \"Ten years ago, we worked with the German Environment Agency to organize an event about how low mountainous regions will have to adapt their winter tourism season to a future where there is less snow due to climate change.\" Since then, mountainous regions such as the Black Forest and the Harz have expanded their tourism offerings to include more indoor activities, spas, cycling and hiking trails, says Dunkelberg. At 1493 meters (4898 ft), the Feldberg is the highest peak in the Black Forest. On its south side, the view stretches from the third-highest peak, the 1414-meter Belchen, over the foothills to the jagged Swiss Alps. At any time of the year, there are moments when the landscape seems magically transformed into a painting. The Romans called the region in southwestern Germany the Black Forest because they considered it dark and impenetrable. Over the centuries the forest was thinned out. Now cows graze on the flanks of mountains like those in the M\u00fcnstertal valley. In the southern and northern Black Forest, large natural areas have been left to themselves again. The people of the Black Forest care about sustainability, so they offer tourists a range of environmentally-friendly mobility options: buses and trains are free of charge or you can test an electric car. The ascent to the observation point over the Schluchsee reservoir is easy with an e-bike. And traditional hiking is as popular as ever. Black Forest ham is a dry-cured smoked boneless ham with a visible fatty rind. Its distinctive blackish-brown rind develops when it's smoked over wood from local conifers. Cut into wafer-thin slices, it tastes especially good on freshly baked coarse rye bread. \"Black Forest Ham\" is now a protected designation of origin in the EU. Black Forest farmsteads have shaped the face of the region for centuries. The Vogtsbauernhof dates from 1612 and is a historically listed building in the open-air museum of the same name near Gutach. Its pitched wooden-shingled and thatched roof with its long overhang is typical. In summer it supplies shade, and in winter it can withstand the wind and accumulated masses of snow. Whoever invented the cuckoo clock is disputable, though tradition has it that the cuckoo was originally supposed to be a cockerel - but its \"cock-a-doodle-do\" was too complicated. The biggest specimens, up to 15 meters in height, one with a 150-kilo cuckoo, are in Schonach and Triberg, the Black Forest's two centers of cuckoo clock production. The traditional spa town of Baden-Baden is considered the gateway to the Black Forest. New buildings like the Museum Frieder Burda provide a modern contrast to its genteel center, with its Kurhaus assembly rooms, casino and parks. Outstanding artworks by painters such as Gerhard Richter are shown here, and opera divas such as Anna Netrebko give concerts in the Festspielhaus. The residential city of Donaueschingen lies at the point where Europe's second-largest river begins its journey. Discovered by the Roman general Tiberius, the source, between St. John's Church and the palace, is again open to the public after extensive restoration. The city gets more than 1700 hours of sunshine annually, the most in Germany. The world\u2019s first \u201csolar university\u201d offers an international degree in renewable energy management, and the \"Solarsiedlung,\" a housing estate with 50 energy-autonomous houses, has set standards as a model environmental project. Not only in Germany is Freiburg considered one of the world's greenest cities. To enjoy such delicacies as a starter of pumpkin garnished with apple blossoms, gourmets come from far and wide to Baiersbronn in the northern Black Forest. It has two chefs with three Michelin stars each and one with two stars. The Hotel Traube-Tonbach has a special reputation with its Schwarzwaldstube restaurant, which star chef Harald Wohlfahrt shaped over many years. Author: Ille Simon In view of the extent of natural disasters \u2014 including fires, droughts and floods, among others \u2014 it is clear that the tourism industry must change its course to adapt to climate change. Yet some say this is happening far too slowly. Wolfgang G\u00fcnther from the Institute for Tourism Research in Northern Europe (NIT) in Kiel calls for adaptations to be made at a faster pace. He says it is important to have \"more flexibility\" to be better prepared for changing weather conditions and to be able to modify or develop completely new offerings in a respective region. Expanding tourism offerings, including making new hiking trails, is one way to diversify Sometimes it helps to look beyond an area's geographical characteristics to find solutions, says Hans-Joachim Hermann. He\u00a0heads the department for\u00a0international sustainability strategies, policy and knowledge transfer at the German Environment Agency. Hermann cites an example from Switzerland, where in 2003, the Stockhornbahn AG \u2014\u00a0a travel company in the Bernese Oberland \u2014 decided to stop operating ski slopes and instead focus on a different kind of winter tourism. \"The ski operation was running at a loss ... so they developed a new business model that focused on excursions, expanding gastronomy, as well as a wide range of nature-oriented summer and winter activities, while reducing winter operations from Wednesday to Sunday.\"\u00a0 In order to create similar success stories in Germany, the German Environment Agency, together with the German Tourism Association, PIK and other associations, created a guide called Adapting to Climate Change: Shaping the Future in Tourism . It offers tourism managers well-founded factual knowledge and ideas about how to make the respective holiday regions successful in the future by using new tourism strategies. Some tourism regions have promoted cycling to expand offerings All experts seem to agree that the basic rule when implementing new strategies is: the earlier, the better. This includes an economic dimension, emphasizes G\u00fcnther of the NIT.\u00a0\"Reacting early is definitely cheaper than having to make repairs afterwards.\" This could mean, for example, creating new routes for hikers before the existing paths are destroyed by floods. Winter sports resorts, for example, could expand hiking and cycling tourism offers when snow is no longer guaranteed.\u00a0 Once a natural disaster occurs, only a functional early warning system and evacuation plans can help bring people to safety. The example of the Ahr Valley made such deficits in existing disaster management all too clear. Since then, there has been a debate about how to improve the warning and alert system in Germany. In the future, this could mean sending SMS messages to warn\u00a0people, which already happens in many countries, including the US\u00a0and Japan. Sirens could also be installed in case power is cut and mobile phone networks fail in affected regions.\u00a0 A sign indicating flooding in Germany is a reminder of the impacts of climate change Shortly after the major storms in the Ahr valley, a spring flood occurred in the H\u00f6llentalklamm gorge near the Zugspitze mountain in Bavaria, killing a tourist and forcing more than 100 people to be brought to safety in a dramatic rescue operation. Such events, says Hoffmann of PIK, will soon become the norm rather than the exception. According to his examination of German Meteorological Service records over the past 20 years, \"flash floods and flooding can occur anywhere.\" He adds, \"the effect of the damage then depends on how built-up the area is, and how well-sealed the landscape and infrastructure is.\"\u00a0 Furthermore, extreme weather will only become more extreme, Hoffmann goes on. Heat will linger for longer, \u00a0heavy rains will become more intense , and storms more violent. \"The diagnosis has been made, now it's time for therapy \u2014 also for the tourism industry,\" he says. How creative the approaches are is entirely up to those responsible for the sector. Rising temperatures will make a lack of snow on the slopes more frequent, including here in Fischen im Allg\u00e4u, Germany G\u00fcnther adds that tourists have also changed their expectations. As they expect more commitment to environmental protection, the offerings are\u00a0being adapted.\u00a0For many, it is no longer attractive or acceptable for snow-starved ski slopes to simply buy more snow machines to make snow in an otherwise green environment. Yet G\u00fcnther also observes that many destinations have not yet accepted this reality. \"Some will succeed, others will be caught up in their failures,\" he says. \"The faster we turn the trend around, the better things will be.\" Spanning nine different countries in South America, the expansive tropical rainforest is a critical carbon sink and home to a wealth of different plants and animals. Deforestation levels hit a 12-year-high in 2020, as ever more of this precious ecosystem has been cleared for cattle breeding, agriculture and mining. The amount of rainfall has fallen by a quarter in some places due to the clearing. 400 types of coral, 500 species of fish and over 4000 different mollusks such as sea turtles live in the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's northeast coast. But at higher water temperatures the corals shed the algae they require to survive. Half of the reef has already been lost. With a global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world's largest coral reef could be dead by 2100. Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, located 1000 kilometers off the South American west coast, are a World Heritage site due to the wide variety of fauna and flora that flourish on the volcanic archipelago. While some species are unique to the islands and their evolution inspired Charles Darwin, this rare natural paradise is threatened by tourism, invasive species, pollution, and overfishing. In 1980, Reinhold Messner succeeded in making the first solo ascent of Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen. In the decades since, the world's highest mountain has been climbed more than 10,000 times. It\u2019s summit attracts increasing numbers of tourists who leave more and more garbage behind. The Himalayan mountains are also seeing high rates of glacier melt due to global warming. By the end of the century, Joshua trees, which give California's national park its name, may have almost disappeared due to rising temperatures. Seedlings of the desert yucca plant are struggling with increasing drought. And even for those growing at higher and cooler elevations, there are fewer yucca moths to pollinate the flowers. More grass growth in the area is also increasing the fire risk. Africa\u2019s largest mountain consists of three volcanic \"cones,\" the highest of which, named \"Kibo,\" reaches 5895 meters above sea level. It's white peak lost roughly 85% of its ice between 1912 and 2009. Researchers suspect that the decreasing snow cover on the Tanzanian landmark is linked to global warming. More than 1.5 million annual tourists visit the historic Incan citadel in the Peruvian Andes. UNESCO recommends fewer visitors, arguing that the vibrations from millions of footsteps make the ancient structures unstable. The tourist hordes are also having a negative impact on the area\u2019s environment. Planning on flying to the Maldives while it's still around? You might just contribute to its disappearance. No other means of transport has such a negative impact on the climate as air travel. As global heating accelerates, global sea levels are rising up to 3.7 cm per year. With the Maldives lying only 1.5 meters above sea level, every centimeter counts. In the future, massive container ships could sail in Central America\u2019s largest lake instead of rowboats as part of the proposed Nicaragua Canal connecting the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean. Environmentalists fear it will negatively impact the entire ecosystem of the freshwater lake, which is home to sharks and swordfish and supplies drinking water to the local population. Lying at 420 meters below sea level, the landlocked Dead Sea is the lowest body of water on earth. But the unique salt lake is slowly drying up. Withdrawal of drinking water from the Jordan River by Israel and Jordan has caused its levels to drop by roughly a meter every year.

{"id": null, "body": "     Though much is known about climate change, efforts to fight it remain patchy. One reason for it is psychological - climate change contradicts the way we perceive and tackle problems. International campaigns raise public awareness of climate change - but can't force politicians to act Recently, while clearing out my old university files, I chanced upon a copy of an article written by environmental sociologist Andreas Diekmann who teaches at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Written in 2001, the article revealed that more than 75 percent of 1,300 Germans questioned in a sample poll believe that \"the cause of the greenhouse effect is a hole in the ozone layer.\" It's amazing that the majority believes in the theory after years of debate on climate change and considering the fact that the issue has been the subject of national consciousness-raising campaigns since well before 2001. In 2003, German environmental groups signed a ten-point program for a European energy policy. An urgent threat The popularity of organic produce shows that where's there's a will, there's usually a way Climate change is happening before the world's very eyes, and represents an urgent social and economic threat to the planet. But as scientists and environmental experts never tire of pointing out, the world is failing to respond as efficiently as it needs to. When it comes to taking decisive action, governments show none of the determination and resolve they demonstrated when the financial crisis struck. It seems mystifying, especially given the possibility that environmental disaster could potentially cost more than the collapse of the financial markets, as the 2006 Stern Report's examination of the impact of global warming on the world economy has illustrated. In it, Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, put the costs incurred by global warming at 5.5 trillion euros ($7 trillion). He proposed that an annual one percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) is required to be invested in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and that failure to do so could risk global GDP being up to twenty percent lower than it otherwise might be. But his message continues to go largely ignored. An overwhelming problem \"Climate change contradicts the way we grasp and tackle problems,\" said former BBC reporter and psychotherapist Mark Brayne, speaking at the Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum in June. \"As a problem, it overwhelms us.\" George Marshall is another British environmental journalist who's asked himself why the problem of climate change seems to defeat the world at large. He's concluded that the sticking point is the time-frame: political systems might be able to address an immediate and pressing concern such as the financial crisis, but are unable to implement global action when faced with a problem on the scale of climate change. In the western world at least, the repercussions won't be felt on a day-to-day basis for some time to come \u2013 which is why the full implications of the economic impact have yet to be grasped. Irene Neverla \"The results of acting today will only be appreciated in seventy years time, which is beyond our imagination,\" explains Irene Neverla, a professor at the Institute for Journalism and Communications at the University of Hamburg and an expert on climate reporting. \"That undermines our motivation.\" Moreover, the causes and consequences of global warming are highly complex, controversial and often contradictory, she points out. Clearly, this is an obstacle to any consensus on an action plan. And there are others. \"Climate change is occurring all over the world,\"she adds. \"That makes it hard to pin down.\" It also makes it hard to say who's behind it. In the case of this year's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, those responsible were easily identified. But with climate change in general, it is impossible to point the finger at any one culprit: society, big business and politicians are all to blame, and are all affected by the fall-out. There is no clear distinction between perpetrator and victim, and that clouds the issue. Climate skepticism on the rise The reasons for all the feet-dragging over climate change are obviously not only psychological. But the dimension does exist, and it's rarely discussed. \"We need to consider these factors,\" stressed Mark Brayne. \"If we understand the role our perception of the problem plays, then we can tackle it better.\" But right now, it seems as though public perception of climate change leaves a lot to be desired. According to a BBC survey carried out in February, only 26 percent of the British public belives that climate change was happening and \"now established as largely man-made.\" The threat is obvious - but a plan of action isn't Irene Neverla confirms that climate skepticism is widespread at the moment, citing the case of researchers at a British university found to have been manipulating important data behind the climate change debate. She pointed to another case in which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035, only to later admit this was a mistake. But Nervela is confident this skepticism is only temporary and these cases will soon become yesterday's news. \"Climate change is an issue that's here to stay,\" she said. \"People associate it with nature, purity and an unspoilt planet,\" she explained. \"On a very elementary level, it's a very positive concept.\" Torsten Schaefer (jp) Editor: Sonia Phalnikar In 2050, the earth could be ravaged by hurricanes and droughts, and populated by millions of climate refugees.

{"id": null, "body": "     Nations need to wake up to the reality that climate change will affect everyone \u2014 and not in some far-off fictional future, says the New York-based Indian author. Amitav Ghosh: Fiction has to reflect climate change reality For Amitav Ghosh , nature\u00a0is an intricate part of storytelling. The\u00a0Indian author with Bangladeshi heritage\u00a0who has made New York his home\u00a0often uses the Sunderbans, the mangrove forests in the Bay of Bengal, as the setting for his stories. These include\u00a0novels like The Glass Palace \u00a0(2000), The Hungry Tide (2004), \u00a0Sea of Poppies\u00a0 (2008) and, most recently, Jungle Nama (2021), a story in verse form about the Sunderbans. The sensitive ecological zone, home to tigers and many other rare species of flora and fauna, is under severe threat owing to global warming. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Ghosh feels strongly about the effects of climate change and natural disasters \u2014\u00a0especially floods;\u00a0these\u00a0are a regular occurrence in South Asian countries . \"I was very struck ... by some of the comments coming out from Germany by the people who were hit by the floods ,\"\u00a0Amitav Ghosh says\u00a0in a\u00a0call from his apartment in New York.\u00a0\"For example, one woman said: 'You know, you don't expect something like this to happen in Germany. It's expected to happen in poor countries.'\" For the author, such statements show people haven't understood that climate change is real . \"In a sense, one of the things that is really becoming clear is we are in an era where our expectations of the past really don't apply. For example, it's often said that affluence and good infrastructure will protect people from terrible natural disasters and so on. And I think, increasingly, we see that is not the case,\" Ghosh says. He illustrates his argument with another example: the wildfires that are raging in northern California , also one of the richest parts of the world.\u00a0 Ghosh also points out that climate change is not just limited to natural disasters that uproot people's lives. It can be as innocuous as Californian\u00a0vineyard owners complaining that their businesses are being destroyed because of smoke getting into wine grapes, he says. Ghosh believes fthat iction needs to catch up with this reality. Since the 2016 publication of his book-length essay,\u00a0 The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable\u00a0 , Ghosh\u00a0has been actively discussing climate change, especially in the context of writing stories. In recent times, there have been landmark novels focusing on climate hazards. These\u00a0include\u00a0George Turner's\u00a0 The Sea and Summer (1987); James Bradley's Clade (2015); Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior (2012); Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake (2003) and The Year of the Flood (2009); and Richard Powers'\u00a0 The Overstory (2018). Ghosh's own book\u00a0from 2019, Gun Island , \u00a0 deals with issues like global warming and the danger to fish from chemical wastes in the Sunderbans. But Ghosh still has a problem with most current fiction works on global warming, a genre often referred to as eco-fiction, climate fiction, or cli-fi. He\u00a0argues\u00a0that it displaces\u00a0natural disasters\u00a0from the present time, when in fact it's all happening right now.\u00a0 \"I really have a problem with these genres. ... You treat this reality as though it was somehow unreal. You project it into the future or you make it into some kind of a fantasy,\"\u00a0Ghosh says.

Her protagonist discovers scores of them in Tennessee, but a university professor who arrives to study the phenomena tells her that they've been displaced from their natural winter habitat in Mexico and are unlikely to survive the upcoming harsh winter. In this post-apocalyptic love story, a \"Robo sapiens\" named Spike and her human companion Billie discover how history repeats itself and humanity fails to learn from its past mistakes. Governments controlled by corporate powers, merciless wars and the dehumanization wrought by technology sum up the book\u2019s others themes that transcend eras. Set in the labyrinth of tiny islands called the Sundarbans in India's Bay of Bengal, the story highlights the conflicts that arise while eking out a living amidst natural threats: tiger attacks, tidal floods, cyclones, monsoons, and also the threat of eviction. The Morichjhanpi massacre of 1978-79, when many Bengali refugees were forcibly evicted by the West Bengali government, is referenced too. Set in Melbourne in the 2030s, rising sea-levels are drowning skyscrapers as the gap between rich and poor widens. The Australian's novel about a dystopian future seems almost prescient considering when it was written and the events unfolding globally now. Author: Brenda Haas Ghosh cites an example: \"New York City was hit by a terrible cyclone in 2012. It was called Hurricane Sandy, and it devastated New York. And New York City has so many writers, poets, filmmakers, artists and so on, but you'll find very little written about Hurricane Sandy, yet you'll find many books about the future drowning of New York.\" He says this could reflect\u00a0a denial of lived reality.\u00a0 \"Today, what is so obvious is that this is an overwhelming reality, for those people in Germany, for example,\" Ghosh says.\u00a0\"They keep saying it's unbelievable, they can't believe it, it's never happened before. And that's just the point. The whole point is, it's not just unbelievable: It's real, it's happening. It's happening to us right now.\" \u00a0 Ghosh believes the West has brought about the current global warming\u00a0crisis through colonialism, industrialization. and, consequently, the new global culture of consumerism and increased production. This has helped Western countries dominate international policy in almost every aspect and be dismissive of cultures in less developed countries. \"The West has been so isolated by its incredible arrogance and its sense of superiority. It really needs to start learning from the rest of the world,\"\u00a0he argues.\u00a0 Bangladesh experiences floods every year in the monsoon when the Padma \u2014\u00a0the Ganges in the South Asian country \u2014\u00a0overfloods its banks. \"But very few people die because people are prepared, people know how dangerous floods can be,\" he says. The Indian subcontinent receives massive rainfall each year between June and September. That often helps farmers, but it can also cause great damage, such as here in Sariakandi, in northern Bangladesh. The Bogra district that houses Sariakandi's 300,000 residents is situated on the Brahmaputra River, which springs from the Tibetan high plains and flows through India on its way to Bangladesh. The river is 3 kilometers (1.87 miles) wide at Sariakandi and is home to local fishermen who inhabit a number of islands now under threat of being washed away. The German Red Cross (DRK) estimates that some 4 million people are under acute risk of losing everything they have. Authorities say that only 20,000 people have fled the disaster area so far. Most, like this woman, have decided to hunker down at home for as long as they can. \"This is the worst flooding we've seen in decades,\" says Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer at Bangladesh's disaster protection services. Most houses are uninhabitable, even those built to withstand floods are now underwater. Many cities and villages are cut off from the outside world. Drinking water has become scarce and residents have to search far and wide to find a functioning well. With an average annual per capita income of just $1,800 (\u20ac1,530), Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, a number of international aid organizations remain active in Bangladesh. Not all of them are there to offer short-term assistance. The German Red Cross, for instance, is involved in a project that would use long-term weather forecasting and other risk data to predict risk assessments for specific regions.  Author: Hao Gui Ultimately, the increasing frequency of climate change-related catastrophes has\u00a0made it clear that we as humans share a common predicament, Ghosh says, but adds that countries need to wake up to this new reality. \"I hope that one of the lessons people take away from this terrible tragedy in Germany \u00a0is that nobody can afford to be complacent,\" he says. \"All human beings are now facing the same plight. You cannot expect that, simply because you belong to an affluent country, that you're in some way\u00a0protected.\" Johan Nijenhuis has produced a film and a series focusing on the risk of storms and floods in his native Holland. He tells DW why disaster preparedness was his focal point. \u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate change spares no country, poor or rich, says Amitav Ghosh", "article_name": "climate-change-spares-no-country-poor-or-rich-says-amitav-ghosh", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change-spares-no-country-poor-or-rich-says-amitav-ghosh/a-58575186", "date_published": "2021-07-21 00:00:00", "article_length": 11326, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:04:03.705330"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Despite powerful evidence that climate change threatens our economies, our health and our safety, we remain slow to act on environmental protection. What is behind our collective inaction? When American sociologist Kari Norgaard released her book 'Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life', she received storms of hate mail from right-wing climate skeptics. \"I think it is a very disingenuous debate that has been manufactured by political interests who stand to lose as the economy shifts away from fossil fuels,\" she said in an interview with DW. \"What they're doing is trying to make it sound like there is a debate \u2013 but actually there is none.\" Most people don't follow the global climate negotiations But Norgaard's interests actually lie with people who accept the existence of human-induced climate change. She wants to know why that knowledge fails to translate into action. \"How is it possible that we have so much knowledge about the urgency of climate change, yet when you look around, it seems that either nobody knows or nobody cares?\" Norgaard sees an \"incredible disconnect between the moral, social and environmental crisis of climate change and the lack of a widespread sense of a need for urgent action.\"  Refusing to accept the obvious? Norgaard spent 10 months studying a community in northern Norway, a country where people are media literate, political participation is high and people have good general knowledge of climate change. The winter she spent there was unusually warm and the snow came two months later than usual, causing problems for the farming and tourism sectors, which are important sources of revenue for the community. But according to Norgaard, the issue of climate change was invisible. Although the media made clear that there was a link between global warming and the changing winter weather, residents took little action. They did not contact their politicians, nor did they cut down on their consumption of fossil fuels. Norgaard attributes this lack of response to what she calls \"socially organized denial.\" This means that although people are informed about the findings of climate science, this knowledge remains disconnected from political, social, and private life. The economic impact of climate change has failed to trigger wider action in the US She sees this as representative of how citizens in wealthy, industrialized nations are responding to global warming. In the United States, many regions are already experiencing climate impacts with economic consequences. People are nevertheless reluctant to take action that may require them to give up some of the comforts and conveniences to which they have grown accustomed. \"People have a real fear about what it means for the world and their future,\" says Norgaard. \"Then a sense of guilt comes up because they realize that our high quality of life through our use of fossil fuels is directly linked to this problem. Then there is a sense of helplessness, because it feels so large and we see the lack of political response.\" According to Norgaard, people prefer to live as if climate change simply isn't a problem. She compares this behavior to people ignoring the Holocaust. Psychologists argue that we are trying to protect ourselves by avoiding unpleasant facts and the feeling that we should take action.  The greatest communication failure of all time? Per Espen Stoknes is a psychologist at the Center for Climate Strategy of the Norwegian Business Institute. He says the communication of climate science has failed to take account of psychological defence mechanisms. \"For a long time it was hoped that just the facts would be sufficient,\" he said in an interview with DW. \"But there are psychological barriers which stop people taking to heart what climate science is telling us, and these have been underestimated.\" Will we be able to move away from fossil fuel as our main energy source? In fact, the more information we have about climate change, the more disengaged people in wealthy nations seem to be. Stoknes points to a 1989 survey done in Norway, which indicated the people were more concerned at that time about the changing climate. \"Only four in 10 now see it as a problem,\" he said. Stoknes explained that the public has the impression only about half the world's climate scientists agree that climate change is happening. In reality, the figure is 97 percent. Stoknes says the way we inform people about climate change is the \"greatest communication failure of all time.\" \"About 85 percent of all the media reports about climate have been framed as doom and disaster. We know this gives people an aversion and leads to avoidance behaviour.\" This would appear to fit with a downward slide in climate coverage around the world, says Elisabeth Eide from the University of Bergen. An author and expert on climate change in the media, Eide calls this 'climate fatigue'.  The power of peer pressure If these researchers are correct and the lack of climate action is mainly psychologically motivated, the problem requires psychological solutions. Stoknes says we have to cross the \"doom and disaster barrier\" and point the way forward. Norgaard too argues for more positive examples and indications of what we could do to change things. Psychologist Stoknes stresses the power of social norms to change behaviour. He suggests campaigns that make people compete with their neighbors, other towns, or even relatives at being climate-conscious could make a difference. He reports the success of an app where people can record and compare how much energy they have used. Another possibility is to draw more attention to easy, green options. \"If the normal way a printer works is to use both sides of the paper, for instance, people will do that. Not if they have to change a setting,\" says Stoknes. A mind-shift away from portraying climate change as a paralyzing threat and instead focusing on opportunities for practical behavior could prevent the emotional need for denial. \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Why don't we want to hear about climate change?", "article_name": "why-dont-we-want-to-hear-about-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/why-dont-we-want-to-hear-about-climate-change/a-17429281", "date_published": "2014-02-17 00:00:00", "article_length": 6116, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:04:04.288885"}
{"id": null, "body": "     India is at the top of the list of nations expected to be worst hit by the adverse effects of climate change. It is striving to overcome the problem by advancing strategies like investing massively in renewable energy. Human-induced climate change is now considered one of the most prominent challenges of our time, with a warming planet being a present-day reality, rather than a potential future threat. The problem has been thrust into public consciousness ever since scientific consensus emerged that \"warming of the climate system is unequivocal\" and that \"most of the observed increase in global average temperature since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.\" Anyone who has experienced the\u00a0 increasing intensity of sizzling summer temperatures in India \u00a0over the past two decades would find it hard to have any doubts as to whether our planet is warming. It has become routine to report about the scorching heat gripping many parts of India during summer months, with the mercury shooting up to as high as 48 degrees Celsius (118.4 degrees Fahrenheit)\u00a0and causing thousands of deaths of vulnerable people. In the last four years, India has seen as many as over 4,620 deaths caused by heat waves, according to data published by the Ministry of Earth Sciences. The increased frequency and severity of these heat waves are blamed on the altering global weather patterns as a result of climate change due to human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, among others. \"India's climate is warming up at a very fast rate. It is warming at a much faster rate than thought previously. Our analysis looks at temperature trends in the country - both annual and seasonal - from 1901 until\u00a0recent years. It\u00a0finds that the country has been getting warmer continuously, consistently and rapidly,\" Chandra Bhushan of the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based environmental NGO, told DW. Harmful effects of climate change In a recent study published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), researchers even warned that if climate change continues at its current pace, deadly heatwaves could make large parts of South Asia too hot for human survival by the end of the century . Up to 1.5 billion people could see their hometowns in the densely populated agricultural regions of the Ganges and Indus river basins become impossible to live in, according to the report. Scientists and environmentalists say global warming is also endangering India's rivers like the Ganges , which holds deep religious and cultural significance for millions of Indians. They note that rising temperatures are causing Himalayan glaciers, which provide water to some of these rivers, to recede. This is affecting the amount of water flowing into them annually. The harmful and profound environmental effects of climate change are not limited to the occurrence of severe heat waves and threats to river water systems. Other phenomena observed worldwide in recent years include: reductions in snow and sea ice extent, rising sea levels, changes in ocean acidity, extended droughts, stronger tropical storms as well as increased frequency of heavy and extreme rainfall events. Already one of the most disaster-prone nations in the world, India is considered to be extremely vulnerable to these effects. Its dense coastal populations could be hit hard by rising sea levels, while changing weather patterns may negatively impact agricultural and food security. They could also lead to acute water shortages and deadly disease outbreaks. India's growing economy and energy demands The potential adverse implications of unabated GHG emissions have placed New Delhi in a tough spot, forcing it to look for ways to come up with measures to cut the nation's high carbon footprint while not jeopardizing its economic growth prospects. In per capita terms, India's emissions are only one-third of the global average and far lower than those of richer Western countries like the US \u00a0or Asian peers such as China. But in absolute terms, the South Asian nation is one of the major emitters of greenhouse gases, currently accounting for over 4.5 percent of global GHG concentrations, behind only China, the United States and the 28-nation European Union bloc. India's energy sector is a significant contributing factor. Asia's third-biggest economy relies on coal for around 60 percent of its total electricity generation and the fossil fuel remains a vital element in the nation's long-term energy strategy. India's efforts to boost economic growth and development by rapidly industrializing and transforming itself into a manufacturing hub are set to drastically increase the demand for energy in a country that is home to about a sixth of the world's population. People in India today use much less energy per capita than Europeans, Americans and\u00a0also Chinese. Moreover, millions of Indians subsist on roughly $2.00 (\u20ac1.71) a day and, according to the International Energy Agency, some 18 percent of the nation's 1.3 billion-strong population did not have access to electricity in 2016. Increasing prosperity may offer these people the chance to get their households connected to the grid and lay their hands on things like refrigerators and washing machines - gadgets people in developed countries take for granted. This, in turn, will increase demand for and consumption of electricity. Read more: \u00a0 Climate change increases suicide in India as crops fail, study says Renewable energy To diversify its energy mix and reduce its reliance on coal, the Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been actively promoting renewable power sources and aims to pump tens of billions of dollars in new investments to expand generation capacity over the coming decade. Ambitious targets have been set: The goal is to source 40 percent of India's electricity from renewable and other low-carbon sources by 2030. It also wants to reach 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2022 - of which 100 GW will be from solar energy. Furthermore, India joined hands with France to launch an alliance of 121 countries to dramatically boost the use of solar power. This push has helped India emerge as a key player in the global renewables market, which has driven down the cost of clean energy. India has aggressive goals even for the automotive market, with plans to allow the sale of only electric and hybrid vehicles starting from 2030. The challenge to realize this objective, though, will be to build the infrastructure needed to support battery-driven cars. Despite these measures, New Delhi has long opposed signing up to any international moves aimed at imposing a cap on its GHG emissions, arguing that it would hurt its economic development and attempts to pull millions of its impoverished citizens out of poverty. Pointing to its lower per-capita emissions, India has repeatedly stressed that it bears little responsibility for the enormous rise in GHG emissions since the industrial revolution. Instead, New Delhi has called on rich, industrialized nations to accept their shared responsibility for all the GHGs they emitted in the past. It has sought comprehensive actions from them to assist poor countries address the problem, for instance, by meeting their commitment to muster $100 billion (85.86 billion euros) a year from 2020 to help poor nations cope with climate change. Another consistent Indian demand has been green technology transfers from developed countries. India sees itself as one of the most vocal proponents of \"climate justice\" - the notion that historical responsibilities as well as present-day capabilities matter greatly in shaping the climate governance regime. The weather in the Po Valley in northern Italy for the past weeks has been unusually mild and calm. Under such conditions, pollution and car exhaust get trapped close to the ground, causing winter, or industrial smog. But there is also what's known as summer, or photochemical smog, which is caused by the reaction between air pollutants and sunlight. Both mean bad news for Italians right now. In the case of summer smog, ozone (O3 - pictured above) plays the key role. This may seem at first rather paradoxical, because ozone is the very compound that protects us from the sun's ultraviolet rays. The rule for ozone goes as follows: If it's high up (stratospheric), it's good. If it's down low (tropospheric), it's bad. Ironically, although smog can greatly hinder vision, most dangerous particles are actually invisible to the human eye. Air pollutants or particulate matter (PM), though of course can be any size, are grouped into PM2.5 and PM10 (0.0025 mm and 0.010 mm), and are far thinner than a human hair or grain of even the finest beach sand. In winter smog, theses particles often accompany fog... On October 30, 2014, German astronaut Alexander Gerst tweeted a pertinent question regarding a shady cloud he saw from space hanging over the Po Valley. \"Is that fog or smog?\" Well, technically, it's both. Don't forget the word \"smog\" is a portmanteau comprising smoke and fog. Strangely enough, smog is often harsher outside of the cities where the pollutants that create it are emitted. The reason for this is that the reactions that ultimately cause smog actually take place at a much higher elevation. The situation is so dire in San Vitaliano (located just outside Naples) that the village has banned making pizza in traditional wood-fired ovens. It's well known that Italy is not the only country in the world dealing with smog problems. In India, the government has announced a plan set to begin on Monday that will keep drivers off the streets of Delhi. Cars with even-numbered plates can drive on even days, odd plates on odd days. Somewhat ironically, India's chief minister has called the plan a \"people's movement.\" The Chinese metropolis Beijing, in addition to a host of other cities in the People's Republic, has seen an unprecedented level of red alerts in recent weeks. This is the highest warning on a four-tiered system, and come amid the highest levels of smog ever recorded in Chinese history. Author: Gabriel Borrud Trump's disagreement This is something US President Donald Trump clearly disagrees with. Announcing his decision in July to withdraw the US from the historic Paris Accord reached in 2015, the US leader cited among other reasons that the deal was not tough enough on India and China. \"...India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States,\" Trump said at the time. The US president's move marked a significant setback to global efforts to tackle climate change, sparking fears other nations might follow suit and abandon the pact. But after Trump's decision, Indian PM Modi reiterated his country's commitment , saying New Delhi would go \"above and beyond\" the Paris agreement and that \"the protection of the environment and the mother planet is an article of faith.\" Yet, economic factors complicate measures to reduce emissions, and the path India takes to balance its twin goals of boosting economic development and safeguarding environmental sustainability is likely to be paved with tough challenges. With climate talks underway in Paris, DW talks to expert Samir Saran about the role New Delhi can play in the success of a global deal. Saran says that India's concerns need to be addressed to yield positive results.

While aviation's share of global CO2 emissions is estimated to be around 2.5%, and rising, nearly 4% of all CO2 emissions can now be attributed to global data transfer and the necessary infrastructure, according to a recent study by Paris-based think tank The Shift Project . The NGO is researching ways to redesign the world's economy so that it runs on renewable energy. 'Limited energy resources' The calculations include both the energy costs of creating IT infrastructure and the actual use of that infrastructure \u2014 with the latter consuming 10 percentage points more electricity than the production of all equipment and technology combined. According to a projection by IT giant Cisco , by 2022 around 60% of the world's population will be online, with video making up more than 80 percent of all internet traffic. Maxime Efoui-Hess, an energy and environmental expert at The Shift Project and author of the study, said we need to urgently reconsider the future of internet use and think about cutting back. Read more: \u00a0 Swedes switch to trains due to global warming \"We have limited energy resources,\" he said, pointing out that even if we make the shift to renewables now, \"the internet is a worldwide thing, so it would require every country in the world to be powered by renewable energy.\" But he said that goal remains impossible in such a short time, meaning we can't let internet usage grow as rapidly as it has to this point. The largest share of that growth\u00a0is now video traffic: 80% of all data transferred online is video data, with nearly 60% of that being online video, meaning streaming videos stored on a server and viewed remotely, via sites like Netflix, YouTube or Vimeo. \"Why study, if our future is being destroyed?\" This sign features a sentiment shared by increasing numbers of German students, who have joined young people worldwide in using Friday school strikes to call for action on climate change. The movement was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began her protests alone in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. With the 2015 Paris climate accord, nearly all of the world's countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), by 2100. The hope is that this target will prevent the worst effects of climate disasters. Concerned by the dire predictions from climate scientists, more and more people have called for immediate action. Despite urgent warnings, politicians have dragged their heels on important climate decisions. It's become clear that Germany will miss its targets for 2020. Climate protection was an important factor in the European elections in late May, with the Greens winning more than 20% of the vote in Germany alone, more than double previous results. Among 18-24-year-olds, 34% backed the party. Germany's climate movement is fighting on many fronts. In recent years, activists have fought to preserve Hambach Forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, building treehouses to prevent the old-growth forest from being felled to make way for the mining of lignite, or brown coal. Energy giant RWE has launched legal action, and police have cleared the camp several times. In September 2018, a few days after the camp was removed again, a court ruling suspended the clearing of the forest until late 2020, after a lawsuit by environmental group BUND. RWE has argued that the forest has to be cut in order to ensure the coal necessary for Germany's electricity supply. Around 50,000 activists celebrated the victory. Protests organized by groups such as Ende Gel\u00e4nde have increasingly been making headlines. Thousands of young activists have come out to staged events, blocking railway tracks used to deliver coal to power plants near Cologne and occupying huge coal excavators, as seen here in the open-pit mine in the east German town of Welzow in 2016. In January 2019, after seven months of negotiations, a coal commission set up by the federal government to work out Germany's plans to phase out coal power released its findings. It recommended that Germany should continue coal mining until 2038, at the latest \u2014far too late for the country to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris climate accord. An increasing number of young people in Germany are demanding that the government find a way to meet the 1.5-degree target. The emerging Fridays for Future movement has been getting support from longtime environmentalists, teachers, academics and parents. They have called for all German coal-fired power plants to be shut down by 2030, and for renewable energy initiatives to be vastly expanded. Author: Gero Rueter The problem: transferring videos online is data-intensive. In 2018, online video traffic was responsible for more than 300 million tons of CO2, equivalent to what a country the size of Spain releases in a year \u2014 for all sectors combined. The higher a video's resolution, the more data that's required. Ten hours of high-definition film consumes more bits and bytes than all the English-language articles in Wikipedia put together, according to The Shift Project. The way we consume videos and movies has also changed radically. In the past, films told a story with moving pictures and music; today, online videos are primarily used to hook a person's attention for as long as possible. \"It moves, and there's sound, and that's attractive to our brain,\" said Efoui-Hess. \"But it can lead to addictive behavior.\" Platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Netflix have increasingly exploited this biological preference, he said. The autoplay function lets videos start automatically, without sound and with subtitles, making information even easier to consume. \"That's just the way to make you watch the whole video \u2014 and it works.\" Read more:\u00a0 Climate emergency: New hope, or just empty words? \u00a0 Last mile is crucial Can this growing hunger for videos be satisfied, in a way that spares the climate? Or do we have to go without our favorite streaming TV series and films? Efoui-Hess points out that it would indeed be better to watch something on a standard TV broadcast \u2014 analogue broadcasting also consumes electricity, but the data is only transmitted over a limited geographical area, rather than halfway around the world, as is the case with streaming video. Lutz Stobbe, who researches the environmental impact of information and telecommunications technology at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration in Berlin, said when it comes to data transfer, the last mile is crucial \u2014 as in, what specific technology is used to bring the data to the consumer. Mobile data transfer uses the most electricity. Basic transmission loss, solid structures like buildings, vegetation and atmospheric conditions \u2014 in other words, weather \u2014 can weaken electromagnetic waves and led to buffering videos. For that reason, the transmission signal needs to be boosted, especially when the signal is being routed over long distances through old copper cables. \"The power amplifiers have a low electrical efficiency, which means that about half of the energy used for data transmission is lost as heat,\" said Stobbe. \"The most efficient transmission technology is fiber-optic cables, which transmit signals by light.\" Germans, for example, mainly surf the internet via copper cables; as of 2017, just over 2% of all broadband connections in the country used fiber-optic cables. By contrast, the mobile communication network is being expanded on a massive scale. To help save on energy, Stobbe is currently working on something known as edge computing, in which the desired data is stored locally, closer to the consumer in places like data centers in major cities. That way, it doesn't have to travel as far to get to where it's going. Exhausted tech Stobbe said those hoping for next-generation devices and processes to be more energy-efficient will be disappointed. When it comes to technology, energy efficiency hasn't improved significantly in the last decade. That's why it's best to use your older devices as long as possible, he said. What remains are small tweaks to our daily routine. \"This is what's called digital hygiene,\" said Stobbe. \"Do you really need to upload 25 images of the same thing to the cloud? Every photo, every video is constantly backed up, for safety reasons, and that consumes energy every time. If instead you delete a few things here and there, you can save energy.\" Read more: \u00a0 AI art: A game-changer in fighting climate change? Efoui-Hess is also an advocate of small changes. \"Use Wi-Fi, not mobile networks, watch on the smallest screen you can \u2014 and high-definition video on a smartphone aren't really necessary,\" he said, pointing out that watching high-definition videos on a smartphone over a mobile network uses the most electricity, and consequently is the worst for the climate. To raise awareness of the impact everyday digital life has on the climate, The Shift Project has developed a CO2 calculator browser add-on that measures the emissions generated by internet activity. Nevertheless, the NGO doesn't place the responsibility solely on the end user; it believes the issue should be an important part of the political agenda. But so far, neither governments nor international institutions have recognized the problem, let alone made any efforts to bring about change.

Despite the urgency of a \"climate emergency\" we're nowhere near fulfilling the Paris agreement. Why are we so reluctant to act? Climate psychologist Per Espen Stoknes says we need to move away from pointing blame.

The NGOs who brought the case have hailed decision as \"a historic victory for the climate\" and \"for truth.\" Despite France's reliance on on nuclear power, greenhouse gas emissions are still rising A Parisian administrative court ruled Wednesday that the French government must do more to combat climate change.\u00a0 The\u00a0group of four non-governmental organizations who brought the case\u00a0hailed the decision as a landmark ruling of global importance . In its 38-page decision, the court recognized that there was a link between ecological damage and deficiencies by the state in following its own environmental goals. The judges held the French state responsible for failures in \"implementing public policies to allow it to achieve objectives it had set on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\" The court set a two-month time limit for the government to decide on measures to repair the problem and stop it from getting worse. French President Emmanuel Macron has been criticized for not moving faster on environment issues at home They also decided that awarding money was not appropriate in this case. Instead the government should focus on fixing its failure to lower greenhouse gases .\u00a0 Reacting to the ruling, government spokesman Gabriel Attal acknowledged\u00a0it was true that not enough had been done in the past. At the same time, he said the current administration was working to address the issues. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been very vocal about his support for climate change action , pushed in December for boosting the European Union's 2030 targets. He called for reducing\u00a0greenhouse gases by at least 55% compared with 1990 levels \u2014 up from the previous 40% target. But at home, France is still missing the national targets that had previously been set under the Landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate change. The government has also delayed most of its efforts until after 2020. \u00a0 Claiming that until now France has denied the \"insufficiency of its climate policies,\" the four environmental NGOs behind the case, including Oxfam France, Greenpeace France, the Nicolas Hulot Foundation and Notre Affaire a Tous (Our Shared Responsibility) hailed the decision as \"a historic victory for the climate\" and \"for truth.\" \"For the first time, a French court has ruled that the state can be held responsible for its climate commitments,\" said Cecile Duflot, Executive Director of Oxfam France in a news conference following the decision. The ruling served as \"a timely reminder to all governments that actions speak louder than words,\" she continued. The decision \"goes beyond French borders,'' added Greenpeace France chief Jean-Francois Julliard. The ruling might also help activists who fight similar battles in other countries. The NGOs also thanked the more than 2.3 million people who signed a petition launched in 2018 to support the court action, saying that the victory was theirs too. mb/dj (AP, Reuters)\u00a0 \n \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "French court rules France must do more on climate change", "article_name": "french-court-rules-france-must-do-more-on-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/french-court-rules-france-must-do-more-on-climate-change/a-56446864", "date_published": "2017-07-11 00:00:00", "article_length": 3106, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:04:05.580100"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Negotiators are meeting in Bangkok to carry forward implementation of the global climate accord. This weekend, thousands worldwide will take to the streets to put pressure on governments. Time for real climate action? It's pouring in Thailand's capital, Bangkok. Streets are flooded, paralyzing traffic. In the midst of this extreme weather, climate negotiators\u00a0are trying to define the manual that countries are to\u00a0use to limit global warming . As nature screams in their faces that\u00a0\"this will be the new normal if you don't act,\"\u00a0it remains to be seen if nations manage. In 2015, world leaders agreed to a global treaty to\u00a0fight\u00a0climate change at the COP21 climate conference in Paris. Nearly 200 countries\u00a0 pledged to limit global warming to well below 2\u00a0degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels \u2014 or below 1.5 C\u00a0if possible . Yet, so far, little has been done.\u00a0 Three years later, they're supposed\u00a0to make concrete steps. By the end of the COP24 climate conference this December in Katowice, Poland, climate leaders must come up with a set of guidelines for implementation \u2014\u00a0 a so-called \"rule book\" \u2014\u00a0 for the Paris Agreement.\u00a0 Read more :\u00a0 Are international pledges bold enough to stop global warming? Because time is short, a solid draft must\u00a0be ready in advance. This is hoped to\u00a0be the outcome of this week's session (September 4-9) in Bangkok. As negotiators discuss, tens of thousands of people will take to the streets on every continent\u00a0on Saturday in the framework of the\u00a0Rise for Climate event. Citizens are demanding that governments transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\u00a0In San Francisco, possibly\u00a0the largest-ever climate march is set to take place. Clear guidelines to limit global warming, along with greater pressure from civil society, could result in\u00a0a turning point for climate action. For governments, it may just be that the time for excuses\u00a0is over.

The rule book should set out how countries monitor their greenhouse gas emissions and report on their climate change efforts, among the most significant points. Read more :\u00a0 What you need to know about climate change The Bangkok session is the last chance to develop a full draft before COP24, after slow progress at a previous meeting in Bonn , Germany, last May.\u00a0 \"In three months' time we will be in Katowice \u2014 and frankly, we are not ready,\" Fiji Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, who served as\u00a0president of last year's climate conference in Bonn, said at the opening of the climate talks in Bangkok. \"This is not just an additional session. It is an urgent session.\" \u00a0If leaders manage to get the draft ready, they could start working on their policies before Katowice. Rushing in Poland will also mean less space\u00a0 for\u00a0poor and vulnerable countries\u00a0 to express their needs,\u00a0warned Gebru Jember Endalew, chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) negotiating bloc of nearly 50 nations.\u00a0 Rise for climate Meanwhile, people have become fed\u00a0up with waiting for politicians to act. They fear for the future \u2014\u00a0with good reason.\u00a0 A\u00a0leaked draft of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, scheduled\u00a0for release in October, shows current pledges to\u00a0reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u00a0are insufficient to reach the 1.5 C\u00a0goal. Worse still, countries are not even on track to achieve the 2 C goal , UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said last week.\u00a0\u00a0 Recent extreme weather events have been the final straw for the public. \"Political leaders like [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel and [French President Emmanuel] Macron say they care for the environment, but they don't act consequently,\"\u00a0Renee Karunungan, Europe media campaigner with\u00a0350.org, told DW. It's time to show them who's really taking action, she added.\u00a0 Although Macron and Merkel have long been seen as \"green\" leaders, their climate credentials have come under fire Environmental, faith and youth groups, including 350.org, have been organizing the Rise for Climate mobilization. Four days before the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco \u2014\u00a0an event that will bring together businesses, local governments and civil society\u00a0\u2014\u00a0more than 500 eye-catching\u00a0events will be held\u00a0in at least 80 countries. A large street mural will color San Francisco.\u00a0In Manila, people will project holograms of themselves in places they cannot physically reach, making it one of the world's first virtual marches. In Bangkok, activists will gather outside the climate session venue.\u00a0 The German group Fossil Free Berlin will exhibit burned wood from an area near Berlin affected by recent wildfires \u00a0in front of the German chancellery.\u00a0The message is straightforward.\u00a0 \"These scenarios are becoming a bitter reality,\" Mathias von Gemmingen from Fossil Free Berlin told DW. \"It is exactly what climate scientists have been forecasting for decades now.\"\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 Climate change and extreme weather \u2014 science is proving the link A push to react Yet countries are still providing subsidies for fossil fuels.\u00a0European financial instruments and public banks subsidize gas and oil production to the tune of more than \u20ac3 billion ($3.5 billion) per year. The powerful fossil fuel lobby is accused of exerting influence over governments \u2014 it's considered a main reason for governments' apparent lack of political will to take strong action to protect the\u00a0climate. Nonbinding climate accords like the Paris Agreement may not change that, since they don't punish countries for breaking promises. If a binding treaty does that, \"[countries] will simply pull out of it, like the United States did,\" Karunungan said. But people\u00a0power could make the difference \u2014 after all,\u00a0politicians depend on people\u00a0to get elected. People must become \"citizen lobbyists,\" in von Gemmingen's words. Politicians are also\u00a0taking action, but\u00a0not enough is being done by many standards. More than 700 public institutions worldwide have already committed\u00a0to divest, including local\u00a0governments. Local and regional governments are pushing for climate protection , while\u00a0countries like South Africa are\u00a0moving toward\u00a0decarbonization.\u00a0This would not have happened without the Paris Agreement, said Dagnet, head of climate negotiations projects at the World Resources Institute. The rule book will increase transparency around government\u00a0actions,\u00a0and enable\u00a0citizens to hold governments accountable.\u00a0Many believe\u00a0the Paris Agreement rule book, together with a society engaged in climate protection, may finally be a determining factor to limit global warming.\u00a0 \"The mobilization on\u00a0Saturday\u00a0is important,\" Dagnet said. \"Let's continue to put pressure to make sure the negotiations deliver the signals we want \u2014 and we need to accelerate climate action.\" As to the moment of truth? Decisive action needs to be taken by 2020 at the latest, experts say.\u00a0Five years after the Paris Agreement, countries must up the\u00a0ambition of their climate goals. By then, it will be clear for everyone to see whether the climate negotiations have indeed been successful. Countries may not have achieved all of their climate goals by 2020, but they will have had to demonstrate good faith efforts toward that end. Unprecedented heat waves swept across the globe in 2017, leading to droughts, wildfires and even deaths. Australia started the year with temperatures near 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), the \"Lucifer\" heat wave brought the mercury above 40 degrees Celsius throughout Southern Europe in July and August and scorching heat hit India's most vulnerable people. Get ready for next summer... Earlier this year, scientists realized that coral bleaching in Australia's Great Barrier Reef was worse than first thought. In some parts of the UNESCO World Heritage site, up to 70 percent of the coral has already been killed. By 2050, scientists have warned 90 percent of the reef could disappear. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are the main culprits. Armed conflicts are pushing millions of people to leave their homes or live in terribly precarious situations \u2014 and climate change is making it worse. A lack of natural resources increases the risk of conflict and makes life even harder for refugees. South Sudanese families, for instance, are escaping to neighboring countries like Uganda and Kenya \u2014 countries already suffering from drought. From New Zealand to Spain, from California to even Greenland: the world has seen a nonstop year of wildfires. Global warming has been blamed for the increased fire risk, and in some countries that risk has turned into reality. Wildfires engulfed large areas of Europe's Iberian Peninsula, causing death and destruction, while firefighters in California have had no rest for more than six months. Hurricanes Maria and Irma, which hit the Caribbean region in August and September, were two of the year's most damaging weather events. The list of deadly storms also included Ophelia in Ireland, Harvey and Nate in Central America and the US, and Xavier and Sebastian in Germany. Warming of the ocean surface has led to more evaporation, and that water may help fuel thunderstorms and hurricanes. In July, one of the largest icebergs ever recorded separated from the Larsen C ice shelf \u2014 one of Antarctica's biggest \u2014 reducing its area by more than 12 percent. While calving icebergs in the Antarctic are part of a natural cycle, scientists have linked the retreat of several Antarctic ice shelves to global warming and are closely monitoring potential long-term effects. Deteriorating air quality causes thousands of deaths around the world every year. India's capital, New Delhi, is one of the world's most polluted cities. In November, large parts of northern India and Pakistan were engulfed by a blanket of thick smog carrying harmful particulate matter. Schools were forced to close, and hospitals were full of people with respiratory problems. The high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere represent a major threat for our oceans, already in danger due to plastic pollution, overfishing and warming waters. Ocean acidification could make these waters \u2014 covering more than two-thirds of our planet's surface \u2014 a hostile environment for sea creatures. And without marine animals, entire ocean ecosystems are at risk. Superstorms often trigger flash floods and mudslides. In late December, more than 230 people were killed when a storm hit the Philippines' second-largest island of Mindanao, a tragedy exacerbated by years of deforestation. In 2017, severe floods also hit countries such as Vietnam, Peru and Sierra Leone. European countries, including Greece and Germany, also felt the damaging effects of heavy rain.

{"id": null, "body": "     Conflict, climate change and weak economic growth are leaving more people without enough to eat, a UN report warning of starvation and famine says. Most of the world's chronic hungry live in Asia and Africa. The United Nations' goal to eradicate hunger by 2030 is a long way off. After a decade of progress, the number of people starving has risen over the last three years, the UN said in its latest report on food security : 820 million people suffer from chronic hunger, including 149 million children under the age of five who are stunted due to lack of food. There are 96 million people for whom \"we must provide food \u2014 or access to food \u2014 so people don't die,\" said Cindy Holleman, one of the main authors of the UN report. The authors estimate that around two billion people worldwide do not have sufficient access to clean and nutritious food. In every continent, a greater proportion of women struggle with food insecurity than men. Eight percent of the population in Europe and North America are hit by food insecurity. Most of the world's chronic hungry, who don't have enough food\u00a0\u2014\u00a0healthy or not\u00a0\u2014\u00a0live in Asia (500 million), with about half as many in Africa (260 million), particularly sub-Saharan Africa. \"Inequalities are actually rising in more than half the countries in the world,\" said Holleman. \"Hunger is worse when inequality is high.\" According to the recently published \"World Wealth Report\", there are about 18 million people in the world who own at least one million dollars. Where income and arable land are unequally distributed, famines can even occur in middle income countries such as Nigeria and Iraq. Not everybody who suffers from malnutrition is thin, says Holleman. \"We're starting to see now that we have a greater link between food insecurity and overweight and obesity ,\" said Holleman. Two billion people are estimated to be overweight. Unhealthy food is usually cheaper, she said. The report identifies three main reasons for lack of access to food: conflict, climate change and a weak economy. Fighting worsens hunger From looting by government soldiers to militias in South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo, war and armed conflict are the main causes of hunger. Since the beginning of the war in Yemen in 2015 around 3.6 million people have been displaced. \"Nearly four years of conflict and severe economic decline are driving the country to the brink of famine and exacerbating needs in all sectors,\" says Federica D'Andreagovanni, who works for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Yemen. In war zones, the supply of the most basic goods collapses as\u00a0it becomes harder to cultivate fields or run shops. \"Humanitarian conditions in Yemen are worsening at a nearly unprecedented rate.\" Zimbabwe's economic crisis leaves citizens struggling for basic goods Import and export Zimbabwe is experiencing a severe economic crisis as its currency depreciates: goods becoming\u00a0more expensive, salaries no longer being paid, imports drying up. In front of petrol stations, cars queue for hours. \"Fuel remains difficult to access,\" said Nathan Hayes of the Economist Intelligence Unit analysis agency. \"There are major shortages of bread, as domestic maize production has been decimated and the country cannot afford to pay for imports.\" Around two million people in Zimbabwe do not have sufficient access to food. \"The depreciation of the currency\u2026 affects prices, which can affect people's access to food, income and employment,\" Holleman told DW. \"And Zimbabwe is an extreme case.\" In Nigeria, five million people lack enough nutritious food. The oil-dependent export economy has suffered\u00a0from low oil prices. Here, too, inflation has pushed food prices higher. The report found 65 of the 77 countries where slower economic growth has led to food shortages are dependent on exports \u2014 often oil, minerals \u2014 and imports. Countries need to diversify and transform their economies, said Holleman, so that they become less dependent on imports and exports, and to make \"rural areas and urban economies provide more sustainable alternatives to livelihoods\". Droughts are becoming more frequent in Kenya Climate change and food security In Zimbabwe, the economy will shrink due to the devastating destruction of the drought and Cyclone Idai, said Hayes. Weather extremes caused by climate change have already hit harvests and food supplies around the world. \"The long rain season is normally from March till end of May,\" said Peter Abiya Ochola of the National Drought Management Authority in Kenya. \"This year, for example we had very poor rain season. It started late in April and lasted just three weeks with some little rain showers.\" Drought years are becoming more common in Kenya. Whereas droughts used to occur every five years, said Ochola, today they occur every one to two years. \"The impact on food security is bad,\" said Ochola, who estimates 1.5 million people in Kenya are affected by drought this year \u2014 particularly farmers whose fields or livestock depend on rain. To eradicate hunger, the United Nations report calls for international agreements that create peace and sustainable economic transformation so that developing countries can better prepare themselves for the causes of hunger. There was a time when hippos and elephants lived in the Sahara. Today it's a barren landscape where few creatures can survive. A small lake fed by groundwater that fell to earth as rain thousands of years ago, serves to remind of times gone by. As the climate in the region changed, it led to the creation of a vast sandscape. Deserts are still forming today \u2014 often as a result of human activity. \"Desertification\" describes the transistion of fertile land to desert. It is often connected to human behavior. When people deplete natural resources \u2014 like water sources \u2014 in areas with a dry climate, plant life disappears and the soil becomes infertile. This phenomenon can be seen in 70% of the world's arid regions, such as in India, as pictured. Every year, about 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of desert are created. That\u2019s equivalent to the size of Ireland. According to the German development agency, GIZ, 40% of Africa's population live in areas threatened by desertification. In Asia and South America it is 39% and 30% respectively. But places such as Germany, the US and Spain are also at risk. One reason for the proliferation of deserts is population growth. In China, for example, the soil is being used to feed more and more people. Farmers crowd their pastures with animals that eat every last plant. The soil is loosened and eventually eroded by wind and rain. This creates some 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) of desert in the country every year. The Aral Sea on the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan illustrates a failed agricultural policy that led to desertification. In the past, the Aral Sea was the fourth largest lake in the world; today there is little left of it. Since Soviet times, the two neighboring countries have tapped the lake to irrigate cotton fields. Fishing boats are now stranded on land. European countries can also suffer from cracked soil and dried up waterways. In Spain, desertification is accelerating \u2014 triggered by the demand to accomodate an influx of tourists from all over the world. Whole forests are often cleared for the construction of hotels. The soil is disrupted and removed, or buried under concrete. The Guadalajara region near Madrid is particularly under threat. Desertification greatly affects lives. Without reliable sources of water and fertile soil, people struggle to survive and often have to leave places they've lived for generations. The GIZ estimates that desertification affects 485 million people in Africa. The UN predicts that more than 60 million people will have been forced to leave the desert regions of Africa by 2020. Some countries have declared war on desertification. For decades, China has been trying to counter this trend by reforesting. Its \"Great Green Wall\" project, which began in 1978, has an ambitious goal \u2014 to replenish an area the size of Germany by 2050. On the World Day to Combat Desertification, the United Nations wants to draw attention to this increasingly urgent problem.

{"id": null, "body": "     The best personal choices to reduce our individual contribution to climate change are living car free - and having fewer children, a recent study shows. But is it a realistic solution to have no children at all? If you were proud of yourself conscientiously recycling on your drive back home after picking up your kids from school - forget it! A new study has identified the most effective ways to reduce our carbon footprint . Having one fewer child is the number one, followed - way behind - by living car-free. If we rarely hear about\u00a0having fewer children, but often about recycling, this mainly due to misrepresentations in government advice\u00a0and school textbooks, the study shows. But once we know what to do to reduce our climate impact, the question remains: how to do it. Biking instead of driving a car is a relatively easy lifestyle switch compared to\u00a0deliberately deciding to have fewer children. Industrialized countries play a major role in cutting carbon emissions and reducing global warming. But fertility rates in these countries are already low, alarmingly so for many governments.\u00a0Yet, this is also key for sustainability. Discuss. It's good to recycle - but not enough Your child in tons of C02 In industrialized countries, one person could save 2.4 metric tons of CO2 a year living car-free, 1.6 from avoiding a single trans-Atlantic flight and 0.8 by changing to a vegetarian diet, researchers have found. But having one fewer child blows those figures out of the water, with a reduction of more than 58 tons of carbon emissions per year. This might be an uncomfortable result for many - but the data doesn't lie. \"Many people ask me what they can do to stop climate change,\" Kimberly Nicholas, co-author of the study told DW. \"And I just wanted to give them answers.\" Nicholas emphasized that she did not want to tell people what to do with such a personal decision as having kids. \"But the data tell us that these four actions all have a big impact on the climate.\" \u00a0 Are fewer children the solution? Nicholas' findings revive a controversial debate. In a world of increasing human population but limited resources , the challenge of sustainable development increases daily. The think tank Club of Rome garnered serious criticism\u00a0in 2016\u00a0after promoting the idea of a one-child policy for industrialized countries in a book called \" Reinventing Prosperity .\" According to the authors, such a drastic measure is a necessary part of a strategy to achieving economic growth, reducing unemployment and inequality, and addressing climate change. A child born in an industrialized country consumes 30 times more resources than one in India - which for the authors was a fair justification to support a one-child policy. They suggested incentivizing women to give\u00a0birth to only one child with a financial\u00a0reward.  Children in developing countries produce far less CO2 than those in industrial countries But for Reiner Klingholz, chairman of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development, this is pure nonsense. The average number of children needed for a stable population is 2.1 - but the average fertility rate in Europe is already as low as 1.5. In countries like Portugal, the average is even lower - only 1.1 children. \"In countries like Portugal, a further reduction in fertility rates would result in social disasters,\" Klingholz said. It could destabilize the economy. Focus on\u00a0Africa An extremely high population growth in Western Asia and Africa is a major hindrance for sustainability. But this is not the case for industrialized countries, Klingholz believes. \"The rich part of the world does not live sustainably due to its high consumption and emissions,\" he said. The right move in Klingholz's mind\u00a0would be\u00a0to reduce the carbon footprint of industrialized countries through a change in our lifestyle while supporting development in Africa that reduces fertility rates there. Europe successfully reduced unsustainable fertility rates\u00a0\"only through education and development,\" Klingholz said. The difference between the birth rate of educated and non-educated girls in some African countries is astonishing. In Ethiopia, for instance, women who manage to finish a secondary-level education have an average of 1.3 children -\u00a0and 5 if they lack\u00a0schooling. In Nigeria, the difference is from 3.9 versus 6.7. Education is the solution! This is in fact the same line Nicholas supports. Having children or not wouldn't be as much of a controversy if we could manage to strongly reduce emissions through a car-free life, a plant-based diet, and a combination of all the other sustainable practices the study recommends, she says. \"If we make those changes and succeed in reducing emissions at the challenging level we have to, the impact of a person would be much smaller,\" Nicholas said. \"This would push our societies in the right direction.\" With that aim, they are encouraging governments and educational institutions to adapt their content and further motivate people to take action. \"They must make clear that recycling is a good start, and it is worthy -\u00a0but there is much more to be done to save the planet,\" Nicholas said. Now, it is up to each person to decide how they will start. You just bought a fancy lamp? Make it cooler with efficient lightbulbs. This is one of the small actions that make a difference in the long-term - and let's be honest, it's not a big effort. Some LED bulbs consume up to 90 percent less than traditional ones. In cold or rainy countries, the task might be challenging - but these challenges are nothing compared to the worst consequences of climate change. Recycling has become normal behavior for thousands of people around the world. It definitely contributes to making a better world - but unfortunately, it is not enough. Worried about your clothes shrinking in hot water? Here another reason to keep washing with cold water: Since it avoids turning on the water heater, cold-water washing also produces less greenhouse gas emissions. Until you are ready to get rid of your car completely, you could move to a hybrid electric car. But beware: The electricity that powers it is probably still coming from dirty fossil fuels. Beef production is the largest driver of tropical deforestation worldwide, with soy production closely following - mainly to feed animals. The carbon footprint of a meat-based diet is almost double that of a vegetarian one. Even reducing the amount of meat you eat makes a difference. Renewable energies are the new trend - but we are still largely dependent on fossil fuels such as coal. In countries like Germany, you can choose your energy provider - among some that draw from renewable sources. Air travel is a major challenge when it comes to tackling climate change. Policy-makers are exploring ways to reduce the climate impact of flights - but in the meantime, you can start thinking twice before taking a plane. Particularly to cross the pond. Getting rid of your car is the second-most effective action you can take to tackle climate change. And riding your bike also helps keep you fit! Giving birth to a new person consuming and polluting at the current rate of people in industrialized countries is the worst thing you can do for the planet, according to the study. But if you start now with the other nine actions, your kids might be able to live in a better world. Author: Irene Banos Ruiz Millions of tons of plastic end up in the world's oceans each year. A Canadian retiree in Panama is hoping to recycle some of this waste - by using old bottles to build homes in the heart of the Caribbean jungle.

{"id": null, "body": "     The COVID-19 outbreak has sent countries scrambling to avert economic disaster. Yet in a time of climate change, none appear to be prioritizing clean energy plans. DW spoke with experts to find out why. 2020 is meant to\u00a0be a pivotal year in global efforts to turn the tide on climate change, but the coronavirus\u00a0is\u00a0threatening\u00a0to\u00a0throw a spanner in the works.\u00a0 Just 18 months ago, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the world was way off course in its efforts to limit warming to below 2 degrees Celsius \u00a0(3.6 Fahrenheit) and avoid the worst impacts of global warming.\u00a0 Paradoxically,\u00a0the coronavirus catastrophe has\u00a0given the world an idea of how quickly pollution could be reined in with extreme measures.\u00a0The first few months of\u00a0the year\u00a0have seen an abrupt\u00a0drop in CO2 emissions ,\u00a0with the\u00a0COVID-19 outbreak\u00a0 temporarily\u00a0shutting\u00a0down industrial\u00a0activity and\u00a0grounding\u00a0flights\u00a0in\u00a0large\u00a0parts of Asia, Europe and North America.\u00a0 Even though experts warn these effects won't last long, some, like Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency , are fervently appealing to governments to use this\u00a0\"historic opportunity\"\u00a0to\u00a0include\u00a0renewable energy\u00a0in their stimulus plans\u00a0to\u00a0offset\u00a0an\u00a0economic recession\u00a0of historic proportions.\u00a0\u00a0 \"This is the perfect time for a Green New Deal, a scaling up of clean, renewable energy and for a scaling up of low-carbon essential jobs such as home care workers, teachers, nurses, public health professionals, and service workers,\" Keya Chatterjee, executive director of the US Climate Action Network, told DW.\u00a0 So why aren't governments talking about taking the leap?\u00a0 Smog has become a common sight in Beijing as seen here in this photo from 2018 But as this satellite image from early March shows, a slow down in industrial activity has seen CO2 emissions drop significantly during the corona crisis Focus on 'economic survival' \u00a0 In an effort to head off\u00a0the looming economic crisis,\u00a0panicked world leaders have opened the\u00a0financial floodgates. China is preparing\u00a0to inject trillions of yuan\u00a0to\u00a0rekindle its economy, the US\u00a0has approved a $2 trillion (\u20ac1,830 billion) stimulus package\u00a0and the European\u00a0Central Bank has said it will \"explore all options and all contingencies to support the economy to counter this extraordinary shock.\"\u00a0And that's\u00a0not counting the\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0billions\u00a0pledged by EU member states.\u00a0 Read more: \u00a0 Coronavirus shock vs. global financial crisis Robert Dingwall, a sociologist and public health expert at Nottingham Trent University in the UK, said it's likely\u00a0too early to even broach the subject\u00a0of a clean energy revolution\u00a0for many people. \"At present I think the big concern is economic survival and ensuring that viable businesses are not killed off by the sudden shock,\" he said\u00a0in an email to DW.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It is very much about the immediate and\u00a0unprecedented threat,\"\u00a0added\u00a0Dingwall\u00a0\u2014a global health threat not seen since\u00a0the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic,\u00a0combined with\u00a0stock market losses\u00a0that have brought back bad memories of\u00a0the 2008\u00a0financial\u00a0crash.\u00a0\u00a0 The need to prioritize concerns\u00a0also rings true with Katharina van Bronswijk\u00a0of\u00a0Psychologists for Future, an\u00a0inter-institutional group focused on climate change.\u00a0 \"Psychologically, we do have a 'finite pool of worry' \u2014 so we can't worry about everything all the time,\"\u00a0she\u00a0said.\u00a0But,\u00a0she pointed out, just because\u00a0the coronavirus\u00a0is dominating\u00a0the world's attention right now\u00a0doesn't mean discussion has stopped. While online debate continues, she says \"it's just become less visible at the moment.\"\u00a0 The corona pandemic has forced climate activists like Greta Thunberg to halt global climate strikes, at least on the streets Both Dingwall and van Bronswijk say it's easier \"to mentally distance ourselves from the possible outcomes of climate crisis\" than it is from\u00a0the COVID-19 outbreak, with its frantic daily updates and the knowledge that we, or people close to us, could get sick and die.\u00a0\u00a0 Climate change doesn't elicit the same response, said\u00a0Dingwall, because \"weather-related threats are very familiar and we have difficulty seeing them as aspects of long-term climate change.\"\u00a0 Climate-friendly policies\u00a0 still scarce \u00a0 German economist Claudia Kemfert notes that green investments were already on shaky\u00a0ground\u00a0before the\u00a0outbreak. \"Even before the [COVID-19] crisis we had an investment delay in many important areas,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Kemfert,\u00a0an expert in energy economics and sustainability with the German Institute of Economic Research (DIW).\u00a0 As recently as November,\u00a0an analysis\u00a0by the\u00a0UK-based think tank InfluenceMap \u00a0found that\u00a0the world's largest investment funds\u00a0were still\u00a0underinvesting in renewables and other green tech, instead\u00a0favoring\u00a0companies\u00a0using \"brown technologies\" \u2014\u00a0$8.2 trillion of holdings in oil and gas, coal mining, car manufacturing and electric power.\u00a0 Kemfert\u00a0told DW that\u00a0governments could\u00a0instead\u00a0use\u00a0targeted stimulus packages\u00a0to back\u00a0climate-friendly fuels and\u00a0infrastructure,\u00a0and to encourage existing industries\u00a0to switch over. But,\u00a0she\u00a0stressed,\u00a0these funds\u00a0must\u00a0be tied to conditions ensuring that they go toward \"future-proof, climate-friendly and sustainable investments.\"\u00a0 However, it might be hard to sell that idea to\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0and bureaucrats\u00a0in Brussels,\u00a0who\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0were\u00a0all set\u00a0to begin\u00a0realizing\u00a0the EU's highly touted\u00a0\u20ac1-trillion\u00a0Green Deal\u00a0over the next decade. Instead, they'll be\u00a0doing whatever they can to soften the economic crash in their home countries.\u00a0\u00a0 Business as usual\u00a0or a new path? \u00a0 Even if climate change policies do\u00a0get put on hold, psychologist\u00a0van Bronswijk\u00a0sees an overlap\u00a0between the two crises\u00a0that could prove useful to\u00a0finding\u00a0future\u00a0climate\u00a0solutions.\u00a0 She said both the outbreak and the climate crisis\u00a0require us to\u00a0slow down, work together, and\u00a0focus on finding creative solutions\u00a0to our common problems In recent weeks we've seen health care systems strained to the point of collapse,\u00a0a\u00a0chaotic situation\u00a0that reverberates in\u00a0our\u00a0overstressed ecosystems.\u00a0 \"Crisis management in both cases relies very much on listening to scientific advice and acting thoughtfully and with solidarity,\" said\u00a0van Bronswijk.\u00a0 Winfried Hoke, executive secretary at the European Climate Research Alliance,\u00a0agrees. The outbreak has exposed the \"vulnerabilities of our society,\" said\u00a0Hoke,\u00a0suggesting that \"more knowledge about the interdependencies of our systems and subsystems, as well as environmental and physical limits,\"\u00a0would\u00a0help\u00a0the EU\u00a0\"understand and prepare for future emergencies\" like the climate crisis.\u00a0 As for the United States, one of the world's worst polluters, Chatterjee\u00a0of US Climate Action said that\u00a0the priority\u00a0once\u00a0the outbreak is over,\u00a0after\u00a0health and well-being,\u00a0would\u00a0likely\u00a0be\u00a0some form of stimulus \u2014 and\u00a0she thinks\u00a0it could lead the US to greener pastures.\u00a0 \"Anything is possible if it helps get us out of this emergency situation,\"\u00a0she\u00a0said.\u00a0 \"Fossil fuel executives will have to either admit that they are not capitalists and\u00a0that\u00a0they require huge and regular government bailouts, or the market will take them down because their economics just don't work anymore.\" Disclaimer: This article was updated to include more recent figures regarding stimulus efforts on the parts of the US government and the European Central Bank.\u00a0 Italy's tourist attractions are particularly affected by the coronavirus crisis. The whole country is under quarantine. Shops have shut, tourists have left the country. St. Peter's Square in Rome is closed, museums and sights are no longer open. In the north of Italy, only large gatherings of pigeons dare take to the streets. Milan Cathedral rises lonely and deserted into the sky. In Italy there is a nationwide curfew. People are only allowed to leave their homes for work or to do their necessary shopping. After Italy, Spain is the European country most affected by the coronavirus crisis. A curfew has been imposed here too. Accordingly, the Plaza Mayor, normally Madrid's pulsating center, is empty. The huge plaza is usually visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. There are more than 3,000 restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s and tabernas in the surrounding area. Austria's citizens can also no longer move freely. Since Tuesday (March 18, 2020) all pubs and restaurants, among others, have shut. Vienna's landmark \u2014 St. Stephen's Cathedral \u2014 is closed to tourists, church services take place without worshippers and are broadcast via radio. Also, in front of the cathedral the otherwise so busy square is deserted. Charles Bridge in Prague usually groans under the crowds. Now it's silent on this city landmark.The Czech Republic has declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus crisis and has imposed an extensive ban on entering and leaving the country. All cross-border train and bus connections have also been suspended. The freedom of movement of the inhabitants has been severely restricted. France's president says the country is engaged in a health war in its fight against the coronavirus. And the Minister of the Interior has turned everyone into \"war allies\" who now stay at home. Where normally thousands of people mingle \u2014 at the Eiffel Tower or The Louvre in Paris \u2014 hardly anyone can be seen these days. Berlin is becoming increasingly empty, even though a curfew has not yet been imposed. Attractions like the Reichstag dome are closed. Theatres and museums have shut. Tourism has been put on hold throughout Germany. Hotels and other accommodation may now only be used for \"necessary and expressly not for tourist purposes.\" Even attractions without entrance fees are isolated and deserted. Only a few tourists are still on the streets, such as at the Brandenburg Gate. But even if you now have a completely uncrowded view of Berlin's landmark a visit isn't really fun.

{"id": null, "body": "     Australia, a major coal exporter and one of the worst per capita emitters, goes to the polls Saturday. The result could be decisive for global climate goals, as voters demand lawmakers do more to cut emissions. Australians are already dealing with hellish wildfires, worsened by climate change The results of the Australian election this Saturday will set the climate agenda for one of the planet's worst per-capita CO2 emitters. It comes\u00a0as the world faces a rapidly closing window to stop the most severe impacts\u00a0of climate change. The country, dubbed a \"wrecker\" at climate change negotiations,\u00a0is a major exporter of fossil fuels, largely to East Asia and India. It\u00a0has been criticized\u00a0for grossly insufficient climate targets by the UK and US as well as its neighboring Pacific nations who could see their homes disappear as sea levels rise. Australians want action on climate change, but major parties have hardly mentioned the issue in their election campaigns At the same time, polls clearly show voters back stronger climate action in the \"sunburned land,\" having already experienced deadly and costly flooding and wildfires linked to climate change in recent years. Some big businesses, once against emissions cuts,\u00a0have also done a U-turn on climate policy. The country is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. \"Australians are feeling and seeing climate damage now and that's why most Australians are very worried about climate change and want the government to do a lot more than they are,\" said Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF). Despite public support, the major parties vying for votes in the tight election have barely mentioned the issue in their campaigns, said Peter Christoff, senior research fellow with Melbourne Climate Futures, which is part of the University of Melbourne. \"And that's really quite concerning and worrying,\" said Christoff. Wildfires in 2021: Australians are already feeling the effects of the climate crisis Since 2007, Australia's two major parties, the center-left Labor Party and the conservative Liberal Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison, have been in an open war over climate change policies, leading to multiple leaders being toppled. \"The public vitriol in political exchanges \u2014 particularly over an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon and carbon taxes \u2014 led to some of the ugliest politics we've seen in Australia over a 15-year period,\" said Christoff. Labor believes it lost the supposedly unlosable \"climate election\" in 2019 to the Liberals because of a backlash against its strong climate policies and job fears in key seats in coal-mining areas. Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter. And because of\u00a0the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising coal prices mean Australia will likely earn 100 billion Australian dollars (\u20ac67\u00a0billion, $70\u00a0billion) in one year from coal. Meanwhile, between 100,000 and 300,000 Australian jobs connected to coal, oil and gas are at risk if the country doesn't prepare for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to a study by independent Australian think tank, the Centre for Policy Development. To date, the conservatives\u00a0have stymied significant action on climate change \u2014 blocking a major emissions trading scheme,\u00a0 slashing funding on climate research, \u00a0subsidizing and allowing fossil fuel production to expand and abolishing the government-funded Climate Commission. At the 2021\u00a0UN climate conference in Glasgow, the government refused to budge from its 2030 emission cuts of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels \u2014\u00a0one of the weakest targets in the developed world. The UN Climate Action Tracker rates Australia's emissions and net-zero targets as \"poor\" and \"highly insufficient,\" putting it on a path to\u00a0more than 3 degrees Celsius warming. Going into the 2022 election, the Liberal Party\u00a0 pledged to go net-zero by 2050 , but has given itself scope to ignore this . At the same time, it has vowed to continue exports of Australia's coal and gas past 2050 and has included these fossil fuels in its domestic energy blueprint. Labor \u2014 currently forecast to win this election \u2014 has also vowed to go net-zero by 2050 and has stronger emission cuts of 43% by 2030 . It has\u00a0pledged tens of billions of dollars to revitalize the nation's energy grid and install solar banks and batteries. But it\u00a0says it won't stop exporting coal and gas. The Australian Green Party, as well as climate-minded independents, are seeing a surge in support Australia is dominated by two main parties, but by dragging their heels on climate change Labor and the Liberals have opened the door to new challengers. A group of independents, dubbed \"the teals,\" are competing with Liberal lawmakers\u00a0for urban seats. Mostly women, they\u00a0receive funding from a group called Climate 200 \u2014 a relatively new political fund\u00a0established by clean energy investor Simon Holmes a Court \u2014 and have campaigned on climate, integrity, and gender equality. They have all set ambitious 2030 emission reduction targets ranging from 50% to 70% by 2030. And they appear to be attracting moderate Liberal voters who have become disillusioned with a lack of movement on climate change. Most recent polling shows several key seats are at risk. Meanwhile, the Greens\u00a0have enjoyed a surge and are now polling at about 15% nationally \u2014 compared to 10% in the 2019 election. They have pledged to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 , go net-zero by 2035, phase out the mining, burning and exporting of coal by 2030 and convert the grid to 100% renewables. Depending on the result of the election, both the Greens and the teal candidates could wield significant power over the government. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg may lose his seat to a climate-friendly independent Businesses are also calling for more action. In one\u00a0example, Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes is attempting to use his wealth to force energy giant AGL to exit coal-fired power generation. Even the Business Council of Australia \u2014\u00a0which represents big\u00a0banks and corporations, such as industrial and retail giant Wesfarmers, mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto and airline Qantas\u00a0\u2014 is now also calling for major emission cuts by 2030. It's a dramatic shift for the organization that in 2018 called 45% emissions reduction cuts \"an economy wrecking target.\" \"It's certainly not the community that is holding back the Australian political parties on climate action and also not the business community,\" ACF's O'Shanassy said. \"Everyone wants climate action except for the people that go to Parliament House.\" But neither Labor nor the Liberals' targets are enough to bring Australia in line with its Paris Commitments. Emissions cuts of at least 50% by 2030 are what's required to keep it below the upper threshold of 2 degrees warming and about 75% for the 1.5-degree target, according to some estimates. ACF believes\u00a0 the next government should\u00a0take advantage of the country's\u00a0huge solar and wind potential and could quickly cut\u00a0emissions while preserving jobs by replacing fossil fuel\u00a0exports with products created with renewable energy such as hydrogen and ammonia. \"We need to use the vast amount of renewable energy we have in this country. We need to times it by about ten and then turn that into exports and stop exporting pollution to the world,\" O'Shanassy said. \"That would be our greatest contribution to climate change.\" Many countries around the world banned the usual New Year's fireworks to relieve pressure on hospitals swamped with COVID-19 cases. For Germany, that meant an estimated 3,500 tons of plastic waste saved. In Amsterdam, the taboo on home pyrotechnics looks set to endure, with the city organizing public displays instead. Europe and North America saw plunging temperatures, with many regions blanketed in deep snow. Arctic warming caused dips in the polar vortex and a weaker jet stream, conspiring to send chilly Arctic air south. Disruption of the jet stream can also have the reverse effect, sending warm air up from the tropics. We're yet to see which trend will dominate as the planet continues to heat up. Thousands of people had to leave their homes after heavy rain flooded towns in eastern Australia. Gladys Berejiklian, then the premier of New South Wales, a state that was particularly affected, called the inundation a \"one-in-100-year event.\" Some commentators argued that this kind of flooding is in fact becoming the new normal. Europe's biggest economy was given a reality check by its Constitutional Court, which declared the German Climate Protection Act unconstitutional for failing to include climate targets beyond 2030. The court said this would place too great a burden on future generations. The Bundestag toughened up the legislation with a commitment to go climate-neutral by 2045. In another landmark ruling, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered Shell to cut its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was the first time a private company has been legally forced to comply with the global agreement. \"This applies to the entire world, so also to Shell,\" the judge said. More than 230 people died during a heat wave in Canada, with record temperatures of nearly 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) recorded in Lytton, British Columbia. The following day, forest fires reduced much of the village to ash. This was also a summer of devastating blazes for California, Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey, and Siberia and the Amazon. In Central Europe, catastrophic heavy rain turned streams into raging rivers that inundated towns and villages as they burst their banks. In Germany's Rhineland, more than 180 people lost their lives. Parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also suffered extreme floods. Property damage in Germany alone was estimated at several billion euros. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report with an unequivocal message: The climate crisis is worse than we thought and humans are definitely to blame. The IPCC's assessment reports are the most detailed and comprehensive on the topic, in this case drawing on more than 14,000 peer-reviewed studies. At the UN General Assembly, Premier Xi Jinping announced that China would no longer build coal-fired power plants abroad \u2014 putting an end to a construction spree that has already seen hundreds of Chinese-backed coal power projects go up as part of its Belt and Road Initiative through Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. But Beijing continues to build new coal power plants at home. Concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere reached a new record in 2020. According to the report by the World Meteorological Organization, the year-on-year increase was higher than the average increase over the past decade, despite the economic fallout of the pandemic. The WMO announced the figures with the warning that \"we are way off track\" for the Paris Agreement targets. After a pandemic hiatus, the UN Climate Change Conference was back in 2021, but it struggled to decide the details of the Glasgow Climate Pact. With India and China resisting a commitment to phase out coal, the final text agreed only to a \"phasedown.\" For many, this was hugely disappointing, though not necessarily surprising. Greta Thunberg had already declared COP26 \"a global greenwash festival.\" With the year drawing to a close, the US was hit by more extreme weather as 36 tornadoes swept through six states and left devastation in their wake. Homes and businesses were demolished, while dozens of people were killed. President Biden announced an investigation into global heating's impact on the tornadoes. Soonafter, nearly 400 people died in the Philippines after Typhoon Rai hit.

{"id": null, "body": "     From activists risking their liberty to block coal, to US businesses sticking with the Paris accord regardless of Trump, ordinary folk fed up waiting for change have outshone the big political players at COP24. Averting catastrophic climate change is a task for the world. And the main players in the struggle break down into three groups: countries, businesses and citizens. So says Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, former Peruvian environment minister and head of WWF Climate and Energy. As the climate talks in Poland draw to a close, many of us feel like we've heard quite enough from countries \u2014\u00a0or their governments: Lack of ambition, squabbles over finance, empty promises. But businesses and citizens also hold key pieces to the COP24 puzzle. And more and more of them, all over the world, are standing up for our planet's future. \"People's lives are at stake,\" said Miray, one of the many Turkish activists risking their freedom to fight the expansion of coal-fired power plants, and who\u00a0didn't want to give her real name. That simple imperative is driving climate advocates in the United States, too, ever since President Donald Trump announced his plan to pull out of the Paris Agreement. Rather than giving up, ordinary people decided to take the lead. The US We Are Still In coalition now has more than 3,500 members, including federal states, cities, Native American tribes, businesses, universities, cultural and faith groups, and health care organizations. Governments need to take action. But while they dither over how, and how much, the people they represent are pushing ahead. Climate warriors Turkey, yet to ratify the Paris Agreement, is busy building and expanding coal plants. Air pollution is already a big concern in the country. According to a report by Climate Action Network Europe, power plants in Mu\u00f0la, in southwestern Turkey, cause 280 premature deaths per year. \"Hospitals are filled with asthma attacks during the winter months. This is what the doctors are saying, it's not made up,\" Miray told DW. Meanwhile, activism in Turkey\u00a0has become a crime, Miray says. Several of her friends are in prison. Yet people refuse to stay silent. \u00a0 People took to the streets during COP24 to show their will for change Miray describes a 65-year-old woman she knows back home, who said the olive groves an energy company want to buy from her and raze to make way for a coal mine\u00a0were what enabled her to raise her children, send them to school and see them grown up and married. The woman\u00a0refused to sell. Ordinary people taking on the titans of the energy industry\u00a0is something of a David and Goliath battle. But just as David brought down the giant, climate activists \u2014\u00a0like those who have brought a halt to the Hambach mine expansion in Germany \u00a0\u2014\u00a0are winning victories and bringing hope. Trump's out, but we're in Three years ago, Trump announced his intention to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement and much of the world was scandalized that such an important player would abandon the global effort. Yet just three days later, over 1,000 US businesses, universities and local governments spoke together with a clear message. \"We are still in the fight against climate change, we are still in the Paris Agreement,\" Lou Leonard, senior vice president with WWF Climate Change and Energy, and a key voice within the coalition, told DW. Lou Leonard spoke for We Are Still In at COP24 We Are Still In now represents over half of the US population and over half of the country's economy. \"If it were a country, we'd be the third largest country in the world,\" Leonard says. In 2018 alone, the group generated hundreds of climate commitments. Businesses have pledged to meet science-based climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement, and over 100 US cities have committed to switching to 100 percent renewable energy. With steps like these, the movement is confident it\u00a0can achieve at least half what the US under former President Barack Obama pledged in 2015, and perhaps more than two thirds. And the movement goes beyond the US. The most recent UN Environment Emissions Gap Report \u00a0shows that over 7,000 cities and 6,000 companies from around the world, as well as many other non-state actors, have pledged to mitigate climate change. If they keep their promises in full, it would amount to a significant cut in global greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses mean business When we think about non-state actors and climate activism, we tend to picture protestors waving banners. But it's also about well-established businesses taking responsibility. Climate action is key to our planet's survival. The shorter term, it could be key businesses' survival, too \"The business sector plays a key role when we think about how to address climate change and its consequences,\" Pulgar-Vidal told DW. Businesses are major polluters and hold the power to make drastic\u00a0change. And because consumers are increasingly climate-aware, they have an interest in doing so. \"I am sure that the business sector will continue improving its behavior, because it is about climate, but it is also about their survival,\"\u00a0Pulgar-Vidal said. \u00a0 We Are Still In includes companies as important as Walmart, the world's largest retailer, and McDonalds. And then there is We Mean Business, a coalition that includes more than 800 companies and has also been very present at COP24. IKEA Group, one of the conference's sponsors, has promised to become a fully circular business by 2030, and switch to 100 percent renewable electricity. The German Deutsche Post DHL Group, the world's leading mail company, has committed to accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. So, yes, while governments have struggled to agree at COP24,\u00a0there has been much at the conference to feel hopeful about. The\u00a0lurking fear overshadowing the last two weeks in Katowice\u00a0that other countries following the US in ditching the Paris Agreement, has not materialized.\u00a0Instead, Leonard says, the We Are Still In model has inspired similar initiatives in countries such as Japan, Argentina or Mexico. \"This is very encouraging,\"\u00a0he adds brightly. At least 6,000 people gathered in the heart of western German coal country Saturday to demand an end to coal use. People from around the world joined forces with a local movement that started back in 2012 with a handful of activists trying to stop the expansion of a brown coal mine and save the last 200 hectares of the millennia-old Hambach Forest. The message was clear: Coal is a global problem. The protestors spanned many ages and walks of life. There were young activists dressed in wigs or hazmat suits, but also families and the elderly. People with reduced mobility followed the march at their own pace. A nine-year-old boy was keen to voice his view on the dirty fossil fuel, telling DW he was worried about his future but expected the authorities to do the right thing and give up coal. Demonstrators split up, some continuing the authorized protest while others took direct action to block coal infrastructure. A hundred people tried to stop the diggers at two nearby coal mines; close to 40 people were arrested. Trying to reach the train line, another 1,000 protestors ended up on the nearby A4 highway, resulting in around 250 arrests. Both the diggers and traffic were stopped. A third group was determined to block the railway transporting coal from the Hambach mine to the three power plants where it is destined to be burned. They had their work cut out, with police attempting to block the activists from approaching the railway. In the end they had to change their route several times, running through fields and navigating dense forest to reach their target. On route to the rail lines, there were no major clashes with police but the atmosphere was extremely tense. Police officers on horseback followed protesters up to the edge of the forest, preventing them from changing course. Outbreaks of nerves rippled through activists and horses \u2014 without it being clear who triggered what. Once the protesters entered the forest, the situation became more fraught. They had to walk carefully to avoid tripping over branches while dodging the police \u2014 who physically shoved them as they approached \u2014 or each other as, from time to time, the crowd suddenly surged without warning. In the midst of the chaos, activists called for calm, shouting to one another to stick together and remain peaceful. They held on to each other so no one would fall, get lost, or get caught by the police. Others conferred over the best route to proceed toward the rail line. Eventually, thousands of protesters arrived at the rail lines. Police officers initially tried to prevent them from climbing down on the tracks, but they were outnumbered. Activists had hung guide ropes down the slopes beforehand, but most people simply slid, ran or tumbled down the bank. Within just a few minutes, the railway was engulfed in a crowd of protestors. After an exhausting two-hour scramble, protesters sat down for a rest. The weather was bitingly cold, but there was an air of cheer as the crowd made itself comfortable on the tracks. For now at least, the energy companies couldn't transport coal from mines to their power plants \u2014 a victory celebrated under the watchful eyes of police on the hills above. The police warned that the direct action was illegal, and offered protesters the chance to abandon their blockade without penalties. But most stayed put overnight. Organizers said their protest blocked coal infrastructure for around 24 hours \u2014 which they judged a success. The last 50 to leave the protest had chained themselves to the tracks and had to be forcibly evicted one by one.

{"id": null, "body": "     Anxiety about global warming has fuelled research into a whole range of new technologies. One of these is so-called \"carbon capture\" -- that is, trapping and storing carbon dioxide before it gets into the atmosphere. Unchecked global warming is causing the ice caps to melt Six billion tons of carbon dioxide a year pour into the atmosphere from sources such as power stations, chemical plants and steel foundries. And this gas contributes to global warming by trapping the sun\u2019s rays in the atmosphere. \"If we fail to catch our carbon dioxide, then the planet will change beyond our recognition,\" warns Stuart Haszeldine, Professor of Geology at Edinburgh University. Professor Haszeldine and his fellow researchers are investigating ways of interrupting the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and storing the gas in a way that does not promote global warming. Power stations produce bulk of world\u2019s CO2 The first and biggest step, he says, is to deal with power stations. The burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity is the source of fully one third of the world\u2019s C02 emissions. The technology of capturing the bulk of this is now well established. Germany's Frimmersdorf coal-fired power is the second worst climate polluter in Europe. The waste gases are fed through a solvent that absorbs the carbon dioxide. \"This takes out roughly ninety percent of the carbon dioxide,\" Haszeldine explains. \"And that solvent can be taken away and heated up and the pure carbon dioxide taken out.\" But what happens then with the C02? There have been numerous suggestions. Scientists at London\u2019s Carbon Dioxide Centre have been investigating some of them. Dumping CO2 at sea questionable One of the most bizarre proposals is literally dumping the C02 at sea by pumping to the bottom of the ocean and parking it there. Below 5000 meters, carbon dioxide changes into a liquid. And as liquid CO2 is denser than water, it would settle on the bottom of the ocean and form a lake. Then a chemical called a cathrate forms over the top of this lake, storing the CO2 beneath it. But the center\u2019s director Stef Simons concedes that this solution is problematic because scientists don\u2019t fully understand the ecosystem of the deep ocean. It would also contravene every ocean dumping and disposal treaty. And there\u2019s another major obstacle. Every attempt to test this procedure has been blocked by public opinion. \"So at the moment that\u2019s almost defunct, that type of research program,\" says Professor Haszeldine. CO2 helps oil production A far better option, says Dr. Stefani Brandini of the Carbon Dioxide Centre, is to use CO2 commercially, such as in a method called \"enhanced oil recovery\". This means pumping CO2 into ageing oil wells. The carbon dioxide raises the level of the oil, Brandini explains, and also has a \"double effect.\" CO2 can increase oil yields \"It also improves the viscosity, the way the liquid flows, so it\u2019s easier to extract more oil from an oil reservoir once you inject the C02,\" says Brandini. In the Wayburn oilfield in Saskatchewan, Canada, C02 is pumped 1400 meters underground in order to flush out more oil. This process is expected to extend the life of this field by 20 years as well as storing 30 million tons of carbon dioxide underground. The CO2 comes from an energy company called Dakota Gas, 360 kilometers away. Traditionally, this carbon dioxide produced from burning coal would have been discharged into the air. The company\u2019s director Fred Stern says it makes \"economic sense\" to capture the C02 and sell it to the Canadians instead. Coal good CO2 absorber Back at the Carbon Dioxide Centre in London, Stef Simons points out that another way of storing the gas and extracting more valuable energy is by pumping carbon dioxide into old coalmines. This is because coal is a very good absorber of CO2. \"If you pump carbon dioxide into a coalmine,\" says Simons, \"the coal will capture the carbon dioxide and emit methane in its place, so it\u2019s actually quite a nice production process for methane and keep the carbon dioxide down underground.\" Keeping CO2 in coal mines could be another solution The idea is that the oil company or the coalmine operator would continue recycling the C02, and in this way keep it permanently out of the atmosphere. Enhanced oil production and generating methane from coal are obviously attractive carbon capture technologies since they will yield a healthy profit as well as burying the CO2. But on their own, they would only absorb a relatively small percentage of total emissions. And, of course, they would be assisting in the production of more greenhouse gas emitting fuels. Underground CO2 reservoirs another option Fortunately, says Professor Haszeldine, there are many underground sites around the world where C02 could be securely parked. This means identifying sites of porous rock, and pumping liquid carbon dioxide deep underground, where it would \"spread out and fill up these microscopic pores.\" Hazseldine says the CO2 could stay deposited in the rocks for tens of thousands of years. The British oil giant BP has already embarked on a project of this kind -- capturing C02 at a natural gas plant in Algeria. The C02 released by the gas processing would normally be vented into the sky. BP is sinking CO2 underneath the Sahara Under this project, the carbon dioxide is pumped into porous rock beneath the Sahara Desert and stored there. BP\u2019s Ian Wright finds it \"frustrating\" that this technology isn\u2019t being given tax breaks and other financial incentives. \"We have a relatively cost-effective way of making a significant dent in greenhouse gas emissions and we\u2019re not deploying it today because there\u2019s no long-term, stable incentives that will allow us to do this.\" Carbon capture affordable? There are scientists who say that carbon capture is not horrendously expensive. According to one estimate, the whole process of capture and storage would add about 300 euros a year to the energy bill of a typical European household. The scientists argue that if governments made carbon expensive to emit through taxation and regulation, these costs would be easily affordable. Professor Haszeldine says governments are not acting with sufficient urgency. The European Union for example, has plans to look at deploying carbon dioxide storage initially by 2015 with the potential for large-scale projects in 2025. Haszeldine thinks this is \"quite late.\" \"I\u2019d want to see this really rolled out immediately,\" Haszeldine says, \"and we should be looking to have a lot of these working by 2015, maybe 12 or 15 plants in Europe. We should be looking to build all of our plants in this way by 2020 at the latest.\u2019\u2019 The Carbon researchers say a fundamental shift in the climate of political opinion is required, especially in the United States. If this happened, it could transform the economics of carbon capture and lead to the largest single reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and save the planet from some of the worst effects of global warming.

{"id": null, "body": "     Increasing droughts around the world may reduce barley yields, resulting in shortages of beer, a fall in global consumption and a rise in prices for the beloved beverage around the world, a new study finds. Bad news, beer lovers: Climate change doesn't just cause rising sea levels,\u00a0 stronger hurricanes and more intense wildfires \u00a0 - \u00a0it could also disrupt the global beer supply, causing severe shortages. That's because increasingly severe and widespread droughts and heat could trigger a worldwide decline in yields of barley,\u00a0beer's main ingredient. This could result in a rise in beer prices and a corresponding drop in beer consumption, suggests a new international study \u00a0conducted by the University of California, Irvine, and the United Kingdom's University of East Anglia (UEA), among others. Read more:\u00a0 Germany's farmers feel the heat of climate change Making rich people care about climate change For the study, researchers from the UK, China, Mexico and the United States identified extreme climate events and modeled the impacts of these climate events on barley yields in 34 world regions. They then examined the effects of the resulting barley supply shock on the supply and price of beer in each region under a range of future climate scenarios. \"It's the first time this has been done,\" study coordinator and lead UK author\u00a0Dabo Guan\u00a0told DW. The professor of climate change at UEA said they wanted people in western and developed countries to be aware that climate change will seriously impact their private lives.\u00a0 \"They may not suffer hunger from climate change the way people in developing countries will, but their quality of life will seriously decline,\" he added. Global barley yields could be reduced by roughly 20 percent due to extreme weather Global consequences Results from the new study reveal potential average yield losses ranging from 3 to 17 percent, depending on the severity of the conditions.\u00a0 During the most severe climate events, the results indicate global beer consumption would decline by 16 percent, or 29 billion liters (7.6\u00a0billion gallons), which is roughly equal to the total amount of beer consumed in the United States annually. Beer prices would also double. Even in milder\u00a0scenarios, the study shows beer consumption could drop\u00a04 percent, while beer prices could rise\u00a015 percent.

Countries that have consumed the most beer per capita\u00a0in recent years would also be affected most in terms of absolute beer consumption. With 1.4 billion citizens, China is now the number one country when it comes to beer consumption by volume. With increasing\u00a0extreme weather events, beer consumption there\u00a0could fall by 4.34 billion liters \u2014 translating into roughly 10 percent of current consumption. China's beer consumption could fall by 4.34 billion liters, roughly 10 percent of current consumption In the US, beer consumption could drop\u00a020 percent as droughts and heat waves strike. Some Americans might just have to give up certain popular drinking games, such as beer pong and keg stands.\u00a0 In Germany \u2014 a country famed for its pilsner \u2014 beer consumption could decrease by roughly 30 percent. That would make for a very different Oktoberfest.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And in the UK, consumption could fall by more than a third, while the price of the beloved tipple could as much as double.\u00a0 Price rises in beer-loving countries\u00a0 Changes in barley supply would\u00a0affect the amount available for making beer in each region differently, as\u00a0distribution of the grain for livestock feed, beer brewing\u00a0and other uses depends on region-specific prices. Certain beer-loving European countries would be hit hardest by high prices, thanks to an average drop of 27 to 38 percent in the supply available for breweries in more extreme weather event years. Beer prices in the Czech Republic could shoot up to several times what it costs now \"In terms of relative change, the most affected countries are Eastern European countries, such as Estonia, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Their price is going to increase six or seven times,\"\u00a0Guan said. \"So a bottle of beer that's currently 70 cents will cost $3.50 [\u20ac3].\" Read more:\u00a0 Six things you can do to avoid climate catastrophe Read more:\u00a0 Water and climate change: 'Era of stable abundance is over' Although these EU countries brew a lot of beer, and their population drinks a lot of beer, they don't produce much beer-quality barley. Most of the barley is\u00a0imported from other countries. And one EU country famed for its stout could see a dramatic change in price and drinking habits as a result.\u00a0 \"Ireland is going to have the highest change in terms of the absolute price change,\"\u00a0Guan said. \"So while an Irish citizen is currently paying around $2.50 for half a liter of beer, that will roughly double to $5 during extreme weather events.\" That could result in\u00a0beer consumption drop\u00a0from roughly one bottle per day to one bottle per week per person, added Guan.\u00a0 In the end, the researchers concluded\u00a0that whether or not people still get to enjoy a beer will likely depend on their willingness to pay.

The same goes for other \"luxury\" items\u00a0such as wine, tea, coffee and chocolate. \"With increasing extreme weather events, luxury items will be getting very expensive or not available at all,\"\u00a0Guan said. \"Of course it doesn't kill you,\" he added. \"But your quality of life will be seriously compromised and social stability will come under threat. And maybe that will shake people awake to do something about climate change now.\" Social distancing is definitely not a part of the traditional Oktoberfest concept. The world's largest beer festival, which attracted 6.3 million visitors in 2019, gathers thousands of people celebrating in beer tents. It has now been confirmed that the Bavarian event will not take place for a second year in a row due to the coronavirus pandemic. While Munich's Oktoberfest has been canceled once again, Dubai, which is holding its World Expo this year, is reportedly planning its own version of the famous beer festival at the Dubai Marina. According to reports, it would start on October 7, and instead of the usual two weeks of the German version, it would last six months. Every year, thousands of people attend the Qingdao International Beer Festival, or Asian Oktoberfest, in Qingdao city in Shandong province in eastern China. Attendees get to taste over 200 different beers from more than 40 international brewers. This year's festivities will take place from late July through August 2021. The twin cities of Kitchener and Waterloo in the province of Ontario have jointly hosted an annual Oktoberfest since 1969. Visitors usually have the opportunity to attend one of more than 40 events. After a \"virtual\" version last yer, organizers are hoping for a return to normal in 2021. Shown here: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opening the ceremonies in 2016 by tapping the first keg. Melbourne held its first ever Oktoberfest street parade on September 16, 2017. Up to 50 participants dressed in traditional Bavarian lederhosen and dirndls celebrated in the streets of the city's South Wharf district. Among the performances: thigh-slapping, yodeling and pork knuckle-eating. Since 1970, residents of Helen in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Georgia have organized an annual Oktoberfest for the local community. Modeled on a traditional Bavarian town, Helen normally attracts up to 2 million visitors a year from around the United States. If you go to this small town in southern Brazil, you may wonder whether you are still in South America. Founded by German immigrants in 1850, Blumenau has retained its distinctive Bavarian character throughout the years. Residents host one of the largest annual Oktoberfest celebrations in the entire continent. In sunny El Cajon near San Diego, residents normally come together every October to enjoy bratwurst, potato salad and German beer as part of their own Oktoberfest celebrations. Shown here, the German band Guggenbach-Buam joined the celebrations in pre-pandemic times, performing traditional Bavarian festive music. Billed as the largest Oktoberfest celebration in the United States, Oktoberfest Zinzinnati was first held in 1976. The festival traditionally kicks off with the \"Running of the Wieners,\" where some 100 dachshunds wearing a hot dog bun costume race against each other. Another quirky event is the World's Largest Chicken Dance. It's still unclear whether it will be held in its normal format in 2021.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate protection in some countries is improving. But the world's 61 biggest emitters are failing to take action needed to stick to 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, according to the latest Climate Change Performance Index. Renewables are intrinsic to reaching climate goals Developments in renewable energy expansion , climate policy and a coal phase-out offer reasons to hope, but the pace of transformation is still worryingly slow and far behind what's required to stop runaway global heating, according to this year's Climate Change Performance Index. The top three spots on the index remained empty again this year as not a single country is on a pathway to keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) \u2014 the Paris Agreement \u00a0threshold for warming\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0according to an assessment of 60 countries plus the EU, who are collectively responsible for 90% of global CO2 emissions.\u00a0 German-based NGO\u00a0Germanwatch and the NewClimate Institute, which supports countries to design, evaluate and implement sustainable energy policies,\u00a0publish the index yearly as a way to compare countries' climate performance using common criteria. Scientists score nations based on CO2 emissions, the percentage of renewables in the energy mix, the pace of clean expansion, and what lawmakers are doing to implement climate change policy. Norway scored the first-ever \"very high\" in any of the index categories for its progress in renewable energy. And 15 countries were awarded \"high\" in the overall ratings table that takes in all four categories \u2014 that's up from 14 states last year. Denmark, Sweden and Norway were top of the class, placing fourth, fifth and sixth respectively thanks to the strides made in green energy expansion and climate policy. Scandinavia is a role model for ambitious climate protection, according to the report. \"We're at the beginning of a decade that will mainly be about implementing the climate targets that have been set,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne of the Cologne-based NewClimate Institute and one of the report's authors. \"Denmark, Sweden and Norway, like Great Britain and Morocco, are doing much better than the rest of the world. France, Luxembourg and Germany have moved into the \"green zone\" on the index's rating table thanks to improvements in their performance. Europe's economic powerhouse, Germany, had been languishing mid-table since 2013 but has bounced back up the ranks to place 13. Still, index co-author Jan Burck from Germanwatch warns that it's too early to celebrate as the rating also includes the rather fuzzy climate policy category. The country has set itself ambitious goals but \"politics hasn't provided a sufficient answer on how to reach those climate targets.\" High per capita emissions and the long-stalled expansion of renewable energy are Germany's main stumbling blocks. Protest against new powerlines: Germany lags behind in the expansion of renewable energy \"We need a 100-day plan under the new German government right at the beginning of its term and then serious progress across all sectors,\" said\u00a0Thea Uhlich from Germanwatch, who co-authored the index. That, she added, includes phasing out\u00a0coal by 2030, a turbo-charged expansion of green energy sources and emissions cuts in the transport sector. The EU taken as one is at the upper end of the mid-table rankings when it comes to climate performance. But some member states, namely Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Czech Republic, are performing poorly. Announcements coming out of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, are raising hopes that could change though, Germanwatch's Jan Burck told DW. Several countries have said they plan to phase out coal within the next 15 years and that is not reflected in the current index. \"Most interestingly, many Eastern European countries that are extremely dependent on coal, including Poland, have signed onto this agreement. And South Africa is coordinating with some Western states like Germany to phase out coal more quickly with their support,\" Burck said. Dirty power: Poland's Belchatow coal-fired power plant is one of the biggest in Europe Under the new plans, these countries could move up the index ranking next year. Right now, South Africa is considered \"low\" and Poland \"very low.\" Russia and Australia are trailing behind the US and Algeria at the bottom of the table in the \"red\" zone. Only South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan perform worse. The world's biggest emitter China is designated \"low\" and has slipped four places to 37. High emissions and poor energy efficiency are the biggest problems for the People's Republic. But one area in which it is doing well is renewable energy expansion. At 23rd on the index, it's ahead of Germany. The first year of Joe Biden's presidency has had some positive impacts on the world's second-largest emitter, the USA. It climbed up from last place to 55 but still has a long way to go. The country scored \"very low\" in greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy expansion, and energy use. It was an improved climate policy and the country's new 2030 climate targets that gave the US a bump, said NewClimate Institute's Niklas H\u00f6hne. \"We have to see in the coming years whether Biden's policies actually bear fruit,\" H\u00f6hne said. China is ahead of Germany when it comes to the expansion of green energy sources There are fears that India is at a turning point for the worse. Currently listed as \"good\" and in tenth place, the country has benefited from relatively low per capita emissions. But these are on the rise and only strong climate targets coupled with ambitious implementation will prevent it crashing down the index rankings, according to the authors. Still, the country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a revised climate protection plan for 2030 during the World Leaders Summit at the COP26. \"If these new goals are backed up with sector targets and well implemented, India would be well on its way,\" the index authors wrote.

{"id": null, "body": "     The Turkana people have persevered in an arid landscape, but weather in this region in Kenya\u2019s Northwest is getting ever more erratic due to climate change, putting the Turkana at risk. In Turkana's punishing terrain in northwestern Kenya, dry periods are getting longer, rainfall patterns are changing and water is scarce. 10-year-old John Lechipan sits on the sun-scorched earth to have a rather unusual breakfast. The temperature is hovering at around 45 degrees. Nearby, goats and sheep are scrambling for a place under a flat-topped acacia tree to shelter themselves from the sun's unforgiving rays. Clad in traditional Turkana attire made from goat skin, Leshornai Lechipan points at his child, who is busy suckling from a goat, his lower lip pierced as is the custom. John's main meal today is goat milk. On account of the acute food shortage, the 10-year-old has been forced to live on a diet of milk alone, straight from the goat's udder. The change in climate has heightened the level of poverty for the people of Turkana, who are already one of Kenya's poorest communities, living as they do in the country's arid northern region. His father Leshornai Lechipan says that things have changed for the family due to the erratic weather. Now life is becoming a daily struggle, as food and water are scarce. \"Most of our animals have died because of the lack of water in this region. Now I've been forced to give one of my goats to my son, who is 10 years old, so that he can suckle with the goat's newly born,\" Lechipan said. \"The goat's kid will first start suckling from its mother, and then my son can suckle as well. That way he'll have energy to look after the animals until evening falls,\" he explained.  Food insecurity to increase with change in climate Under the intense heat, 48-year old Kigen counts his losses as he passes through a pathway littered with some of his dead animals. Together with over 20 other herders, he travelled from Baragoi to Kirisia about 80 kilometers after he heard news of small rain showers in that region. Hope of encountering rain makes herders take their cattle on long trips On arrival at Kirisia, the group found no rain, just the dry Turkana land, scorched by the sun. \"Since the weather started changing, I haven't been able to benefit from my farm because we have no water,\" says Kigen. According to a report by Human Rights Watch climate change, among other factors, is contributing to the Turkana people's lack of access to food and water. Rainfall patterns, the report adds, have become unpredictable, and average temperatures in the region have increased by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius. Human Rights Watch researcher Felix Horne says the food insecurity people are facing here is very likely to exacerbate. \"Everything here is about water, so as the temperatures increase and the levels of drought increase, the impacts on Turkana are going to be extremely devastating,\" Horne said. He added that as a result many people have become dependent on food aid, especially from the UN's World Food Programme and the Canadian Food Grains Bank.  Drought in the Horn of Africa region The impact of the severe drought is also being felt beyond Turkana \u2013 in other parts of Kenya, and across Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia, where it's also led to a food crisis and severe cases of malnutrition. It is not just the Turkana that are affected, but other indigenous peoples in the region as well. According to the UN's World Food Program (WFP), over 1.5 million people are malnourished in Somalia, while over 7 million are being affected by the drought in Ethiopia. The WFP has provided urgent food aid to around 3.8 million people. Climate scientists predict the worst of climate change is yet to come, with the world heading towards a global temperature rise of around three degrees celsius. Felix Horne from Human Rights Watch says warming temperatures will only accelerate desertification. \"Droughts which before occured maybe every four of five years, are now almost constant,\" the researcher said, adding: \"It is becoming more and more difficult to access the grazing land and the water needed for the goats, so that herds are completely decimated, with families now possessing only two or three goats which used to have hundreds.  Horne says that it's not too late to help these communities which are suffering from the unforgiving climate change.  All hopes on Paris As countries gear up for the UN Climate Change Conference which kicks off November 30 in Paris, environment campaigners warn that if world leaders do not act to limit the global temperature rise, then some marginalized communities along the Horn of Africa may cease to exist. In Paris, a global climate change agreement is to be signed that is supposed to set the world on track to limit global warming to two degrees celsius by the end of the century. Without any changes to current trends, warming could go up by as much as five degrees. UNEP's Achim Steiner believes leadership is needed now. Achim Steiner, who heads up the United Nation's Environment Program (UNEP), says political leaders have the power to make a difference. \"Without leadership, without personal responsibility amongst those who can make a difference not much will change,\" Steiner said. \"The question is whether we can get an agreement which is both meaningful in terms of the science, but also equitable and fair in terms of different responsibilities,\" he added. While diplomats and politicians negotiate a climate agreement, the residents of Turkana fight to hang on to their centuries-old way of life, trying to cope with the difficulties imposed by living in a harsh and unpredictable environment. Envoys have reached an outline for a UN global climate pact to be reached in Paris in five weeks. The five day negotiations in Bonn have been marked by fractious arguments between developed and developing countries.

{"id": null, "body": "     Environmental changes like global warming are menacing the entire ecosystem. DW's Eco Islam conference emphasized the need for using eco-friendly religious messages to make an impact. Shamil Shams reports from Karachi. The climate-change discourse is generally considered a Western concept in most Islamic nations. Pakistan, a country of around 220 million people, is not any different. First of all, climate change is hardly a topic of\u00a0public discussion, as was evidenced\u00a0by the fact that only a few thousand people participated in the Fridays for Future march in September. A majority of people, often struggling to make ends meet, either don\u2019t pay attention to environmental degradation or reject it as an NGO-driven, elite class agenda. So what can be done to create awareness about a serious global issue that threatens the entire ecosystem and human existence? Activists say that a lack of education in countries like Pakistan makes it even more difficult to campaign for environmental protection. DW's Eco Islam project stresses the need for engaging with local communities and speaking with them in their own language about environmental issues. As religion often plays a huge role in people's lives, using religious narratives that support an eco-friendly agenda could help raise awareness about climate change. After the\u00a0first DW Eco Islam conference\u00a0in Jakarta, Indonesia, last month, Germany's international broadcaster held its second one in Karachi, Pakistan, on Saturday. The aim of the conference was to highlight Islam's environment-friendly messages and encourage\u00a0religious clerics to propagate and promote the anti-climate-change cause. The Second Floor, a Karachi-based nongovernmental organization, collaborated with DW to put together the event.

Sometimes even the government and media can't influence them that way. It is also important to remind people that environmental protection has always been emphasized by their religions,\" Limbourg said. \"We, as a media organization, can offer a lot. We can initiate dialogues. But we don't want to teach people what to do; we can just put forward ideas with which they can protect their environment,\" DW's director general added.

For instance, Prophet Muhammad instructed Muslims to take care of other human beings, animals and even trees. Humans are not allowed to damage the ecosystem,\" Naqvi explained. \"DW\u2019s initiative provides a platform for people of different faiths to discuss the issue of climate change. But we need to reach out to the masses. These dialogues usually target an educated class; we need to communicate with the common person,\" Naqvi added.

Amnesty blamed rising smog levels on the Pakistani government's insufficient response. Murtaza Wahab, the environment adviser to Sindh province\u2019s chief minister, admitted that climate change had\u00a0not been properly addressed in his country. \"It is a neglected sector in Pakistan. But now we are dealing with this issue seriously. Recently, we approved a climate-change policy that\u00a0aims at increasing the public-private partnership to protect the environment. We have also banned the use of single-use plastic,\" Wahab said. Pakistani environmentalist Tofiq Pasha Mooraj says, however, that Pakistani authorities \"don't have time to address climate change.\" \"But I must add that in recent times, the authorities are being forced to pay a bit more attention to the climate problems because they have become more visible and are affecting people\u2019s lives,\" Mooraj said. The environmental activist also said that people must not always look to\u00a0the government to fix their problems. \"We are a country of 220 million people.

{"id": null, "body": "     The world's largest coral reef system is now anticipated to be in \"very poor\" health in future, due to climate change. Despite large-scale bleaching of the coral, experts insist the problems are not insurmountable. The government agency that manages Australia's Great Barrier Reef on Friday downgraded its outlook for the condition of the coral system from \"poor\" to \"very poor.\" The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's (GBRMPA) report blamed climate change for coral bleaching, which occurs as a result of rising sea temperatures . \"Significant global action to address climate change is critical to slowing the deterioration of the reef's ecosystem and heritage values and supporting recovery,\" said the five-year review of the world's largest coral reef system. Read more: \u00a0 The global injustice of the climate crisis Of the 2 million-odd people who visit the Great Barrier Reef annually, a 2016 survey found that 69 percent were coming to see the UNESCO World Heritage site \"before it's too late.\" And no wonder. The IPCC says that even if we manage to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, 99 percent of the world's coral will be wiped out. Tourists can hasten their demise by touching or polluting reefs. And what's the carbon cost of flying to remote natural wonders under threat? A 2010 study found that the business of polar-bear safaris in Churchill, Canada, had an annual CO2 footprint of 20 megatons. Most visitors arrived by plane, and while 88 percent of them said humans were responsible for climate change, only 69 percent agreed that air travel was a contributing cause. Along with the polar bear, one of the most iconic images of climate change must be the dramatic curves of an iceberg sculpted by the warming atmosphere. Gliding between the melting giants on a cruise ship is a haunting experience that tourists will pay huge sums for. In the early 1990s just 5,000 people visited Antarctica each year, compared to over 46,000 in 2018. You don't have to go to the poles to see vanishing ice. Kilimanjaro's snowy peaks are a striking sight above the equatorial savannah of the national park, which generates \u20ac44 million ($50 million) from tourism annually. Many visitors climb to the Furtw\u00e4ngler Glacier \u2014 where 85 percent of the ice has vanished over the last century. The rest is unlikely to survive much beyond mid-century. When Montana's Glacier National Park opened in 1910, it boasted over 100 of the ice features from which it took its name. Now, there are fewer than two dozen. So dramatic is their retreat, that the park has become a center of climate science research. Some 3 million hikers and holidaymakers also visit the \"crown of the continent\" each year, soaking in the dying days of its ice-capped glory. The Maldives are the archetypal tourist paradise: 1,200 coral islands with white beaches rising just 2.5 meters above the turquoise waters. In 2017, the president decided to build new airports and megaresorts to accommodate seven times as many tourists, and use the revenue to build new islands and relocate communities. He has since been voted out of office and faces corruption charges. It's not just islands that are going under as sea levels rise. Wetlands like Florida's Everglades are disappearing too. Over the last century, around half the Everglades have been drained and turned over to agriculture. Now, saltwater is seeping into what's left, making it the only critically endangered World Heritage site in the United States. The Galapagos will be forever associated with Darwin, who realized their unique wildlife had evolved over countless generations in isolation. Today, they are besieged by visitors and environmental changes are happening too fast for species to adapt. Ocean warming has left iconic creatures like the marine iguana starving, while UNESCO lists tourism among the greatest threats to the archipelago.  Author: Ruby Russell Bleaching and other factors But the agency added that the threats to the 2,300-kilometer (1,400-mile) reef\u00a0were \"multiple, cumulative and increasing.\"\u00a0 Agricultural runoff, coastal land clearing and coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish were also to blame for its woes, the report\u00a0said. GBRMPA's Chief Scientist David Wachenfeld told reporters in Sydney that despite the threat, \"with the right mix of local actions to improve the resilience of the system and global actions to tackle climate change ... we can turn that around.\" Located off the northeast Australian coast, t he Great Barrier Reef is home to 400 types of coral, 1,500 species of fish and 4,000 types of mollusks. Scientists have been concerned about the health of the coral network for decades. In 2012, a study found the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985. A 2017 study published in the journal\u00a0 Nature \u00a0found that 91% of the reef had been bleached at least once during three bleaching events over\u00a0the past two decades.

{"id": null, "body": "     The UN climate summit has been slammed as a failure after India and China weakened language on phasing out fossil fuels and historical polluters refused to accept liability for damage caused by extreme weather. Even if leaders live up to the pledges they made in Glasgow, the temperature will rise by over 2 degrees C At first, negotiators at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow wanted a faster phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. Then they pushed for ending \"unabated\" coal burning and \"inefficient\" subsidies. A third draft suggested accelerating \"efforts toward\" their phase-out. By the time diplomats hammered out a text they could all agree to , the term was downgraded to a \"phase-down\" the use of unabated coal. The result of that semantic spat \u2014 watered down to levels well below what scientists say is needed to halt global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures \u2014 was among the hardest-fought outcomes of two weeks of international negotiations to stop the planet hurtling closer towards catastrophic changes in the climate. But like many of the decisions coming out of the COP26 climate summit, the final agreement has been widely slammed as weak and ineffective.

Working a full day past the scheduled end of the conference, negotiators thrashed out an agreement to submit better plans next year to cut their emissions in 2030, finalized rules about trading emissions on carbon markets, and promised faster reductions in coal use and fossil fuel subsidies. But the final document avoided uncomfortable questions about who should pay and how much. Campaigners and analysts slammed the Glasgow Climate Pact for failing to make rich polluters pay reparations for losses and damages brought about by extreme weather events that climate change has turbocharged. Rich countries now plan to pay poorer ones $100 billion a year to green their economies and adapt to the effects of climate change by 2023, despite having promised and failed to do so by 2020 . With international studies showing the costs of climate change running into the trillions, the sum of money is not enough to cover the costs of the transition and includes loans for which they will have to pay interest. \"It is hard to trust,\" said Andrea Meza, environment and energy minister of Costa Rica. \"But at the end, we need to continue pushing.\" Disguised as world leaders Boris Johnson and Joe Biden, activists expressed their frustration with the proceedings. They fear that the resolutions adopted in Scotland will not suffice to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. About 200 states were represented at the conference. Tens of thousands of demonstrators descended on Glasgow to put world leaders and conference delegates under pressure. Oxfam activists accused world leaders of doing far too little to put out the fire. Oxfam is one of the biggest charities working to put an end to global injustice and poverty. The Red Rebel Brigade is a street performance group that is part of Extinction Rebellion, a global movement that uses non-violent direct action to campaign for more climate action. On its website, it explains that the red of their name and clothing \"symbolizes the common blood we share with all species.\" Using mime, they bring some stillness and reflection to protests that are often loud. Like founder of Fridays for Future Greta Thunberg, Friends of the Earth activists are sick of the \"blah blah blah\" of politicians and business leaders. They want them to end oil and gas exploration in the North Sea and accuse them of making empty promises. Protesters dressed as Pikachu, a character from Pokemon, demanded an end to Japanese support for the coal industry. Japan has said that it wants to be carbon neutral by 2050, but for now it is still very dependent on fossil fuels. Activists from Ocean Rebellion demonstrated for more sustainability and less corruption in the global fish industry. \"We demand that the Marine Stewardship Council tells the truth about destructive fishing methods and immediately stops greenwashing the industry with sustainability lies,\" said environmental activist and Ocean Rebellion co-founder Sophie Miller. With the Projecting Change project, a collective of artists, activists and storytellers want to galvanize action to save the planet. This picture shows a project by the French artist JR who is known for his political works. There was a whole variety of activists and campaigners in Glasgow, but all of them are united by the belief that time is running out for Earth and that politicians have to implement effective policies to combat global warming and climate change, now. \"We want ambitious measures,\" said one demonstrator. \"Delegates have to finally understand how urgent the situation is,\" said another. Author: Julie Huehnken The conference is the first time a UN climate summit has formally named the cause of global warming and agreed to burn less coal. But China and India , the world's biggest and third-biggest carbon polluters, respectively, as well as the globe's top two coal-burning nations, pushed at the last minute to weaken a line about accelerating the coal phase-out in a move that angered vulnerable countries on the frontlines of climate change. Rather than a phase-out of coal, India and China called for its use to be \"phased-down.\" \"We accept this change with the greatest reluctance,\" said Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, which is being steadily submerged by rising sea levels. Fighting back tears, COP26 President Alok Sharma apologized for the compromise before banging his gavel to adopt the pact. Coal was a sticking point during the summit as groups of countries pledged to phase it out, and some banks agreed to cut financing for it, while several countries have fought to keep any mention of coal out of the agreement. Despite the weakened language in the final text, campaigners hailed it as a step towards ending the use of the dirtiest source of energy. \"There's been a very clear signal out of this meeting that coal is one its way out,\" said Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan. For decades, scientists have rung alarm bells that burning fossil fuels releases gases that act like a greenhouse and heat the planet. At a previous UN climate summit in 2015 in Paris, world leaders agreed to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees C, and ideally 1.5 degrees C, but they have failed to pursue policies that would achieve that goal, the UN reported. Temperatures are on track to rise between 2.4 degrees C and 2.7 degrees C by the end of the century even if world leaders meet their promises for 2030. That would spell a world of increasingly intolerable heat waves, droughts, coastal floods and tropical cyclones . The difference between 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C, Maldives Environment Minister Aminath Shauna told negotiators in the plenary room shortly before the final text was adopted, is one of \"life or death.\" The UK government, which hosted the summit, had set a goal for the conference of keeping the lower temperature target alive. After the deal was struck, COP26 President Sharma said: \"I think we can say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 within reach, but its pulse is weak.\" Just how weak is open for debate. \"Even with all the new Glasgow proposals, emissions in 2030 are still almost double what they should be for 1.5 C,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, a climate scientist at NewClimate Institute, a think tank in Germany. \"Glasgow resuscitated 1.5 C, but it is still in intensive care.\" \"It's not a good outcome that could be better. It's a bad outcome that could have been worse,\" said Nathan Thanki from the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice, criticizing positive spin from non-profit organizations in rich countries that were celebrating small steps. \"It's sickening. I can't believe more people don't call it out.\" The two-week conference started with announcements from big countries like Nigeria and India to cut emissions to net-zero \u2014 meaning they pollute the atmosphere with as much greenhouse gas as they suck back out \u2014 by 2060 and 2070, respectively. In a flurry of announcements, some groups of countries also agreed to phase out coal, burn less methane, cut down fewer trees and get rid of cars that burn fossil fuels. The UK government statements on the impact of these pledges were panned by activists over the course of the summit. \"This summit has been a bunch of lies and greenwashing, and it physically hurts me to think of it,\" said Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a climate activist with the Fridays for Future movement from the Philippines, in tears. \"I am so sad and angry and honestly terrified.\" Taken together, deals on methane, coal, cars and trees bring countries 9% closer to what is needed to honor their temperature targets. Including updated plans to slash emissions, the gap between what countries promised under the Paris Agreement and what's required to make those promises reality closes by 25%, according to analysis from Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a research project from NewClimate Institute and Climate Analytics, another environmental non-profit. But the final document also saw breakthroughs on technical details about implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change. This includes the way countries report their emissions and trade them across borders in global carbon markets, though the rules are \"far from perfect\" and still contain loopholes, according to Tom Evans, policy advisor at climate think tank E3G. \"If exploited, they could seriously undermine efforts to reduce emissions,\" he said. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has continued to rise despite decades of climate diplomacy. World leaders will return to the negotiating table next year in Egypt to update their plans to cut emissions. Poorer countries will push to move discussions about climate reparations into hard cash. \"The outcome of COP26 is a compromise,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. \"It is an important step, but not enough. We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.\" Irene Banos Ruiz contributed reporting.\n    \nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent(\n'promio-pym-container',\n'https://system.promio-connect.com/register/16401/default/en/newsletter-form',\n{}\n);\n  \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "COP26: World leaders fail to honor climate pledge", "article_name": "cop26-world-leaders-fail-to-honor-climate-pledge", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/cop26-world-leaders-fail-to-honor-climate-pledge/a-59812348", "date_published": "2021-11-14 00:00:00", "article_length": 10509, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:04:13.555634"}
{"id": null, "body": "     A court in Germany has dismissed a lawsuit filed by three farming families who along with Greenpeace argued that Angela Merkel's government has not done enough to tackle climate change. Berlin city-state's administrative court on Thursday dismissed a claim by\u00a0farmers \u2014\u00a0backed by the environmental\u00a0group Greenpeace \u2014\u00a0that the government was violating their rights by lowering greenhouse gas emissions at a rate slower than promised. The court said the federal cabinet's political commitments were not binding in the way that the group asserted, adding that the government had room to\u00a0maneuver\u00a0in deciding how to meet its obligation to protect property and livelihoods from climate change, and affects such as rising sea levels. Read more:\u00a0 German farmers sue government over climate change failures The three organic farming\u00a0families has cited harvest losses due to drought in 2018\u00a0and apples scorched and left black amid soaring temperatures, arguing that a 2014 cabinet decision on climate was a legally binding act.\u00a0 The Berlin court, however, stated:\u00a0\"The plaintiffs lacked a legal basis for their complaint.\" Appeal possible The court left open\u00a0an appeal option, should the claimants decide to take their case to a higher regional court. The lack of legal grounds, the court ruled, did not entitle the claimants\u00a0to seek extra action\u00a0from the government, even though German climate goals set in 2014 would not be fulfilled by next year. Instead of a 40% cut in carbon-dioxide emissions by 2020, 33% is estimated \u2014 in comparison to Germany's CO2 emissions in 1990.\u00a0 'Legally enforceable,' says Greenpeace Greenpeace lawyer Roda Verheyen said the Berlin court in its ruling had, however, \"fundamentally agreed\" that climate protection was legally enforceable. \"The matter at issue is not purely political room to\u00a0maneuver,\" insisted\u00a0Verheyen.\u00a0 The government, represented in court by the federal Environment Ministry, had argued the farmer's lawsuit overlooked democracy's separation of powers. Germany's Bundestag parliament last week began debate on Cabinet's draft climate protection legislation \u00a0aimed at a 55% cut in CO2 emissions by 2030 but widely criticized as containing inadequate measures. 'Testimony to incompetence' Matthias Miersch, a Social Democrat parliamentarian in Germany's coalition government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Thursday's court case dismissal still made it clear \"which responsibility government and parliament bears.\" Opposition Greens party climate spokesperson Lisa Badum described the Berlin court outcome as a \"testimony to incompetence.\" \"When in the future on our fields we can't grow enough foodstuffs, then we'll know which government we'll be able to thank,\" said Badum sarcastically.\u00a0 \"Why study, if our future is being destroyed?\" This sign features a sentiment shared by increasing numbers of German students, who have joined young people worldwide in using Friday school strikes to call for action on climate change. The movement was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who began her protests alone in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018. With the 2015 Paris climate accord, nearly all of the world's countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), by 2100. The hope is that this target will prevent the worst effects of climate disasters. Concerned by the dire predictions from climate scientists, more and more people have called for immediate action. Despite urgent warnings, politicians have dragged their heels on important climate decisions. It's become clear that Germany will miss its targets for 2020. Climate protection was an important factor in the European elections in late May, with the Greens winning more than 20% of the vote in Germany alone, more than double previous results. Among 18-24-year-olds, 34% backed the party. Germany's climate movement is fighting on many fronts. In recent years, activists have fought to preserve Hambach Forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, building treehouses to prevent the old-growth forest from being felled to make way for the mining of lignite, or brown coal. Energy giant RWE has launched legal action, and police have cleared the camp several times. In September 2018, a few days after the camp was removed again, a court ruling suspended the clearing of the forest until late 2020, after a lawsuit by environmental group BUND. RWE has argued that the forest has to be cut in order to ensure the coal necessary for Germany's electricity supply. Around 50,000 activists celebrated the victory. Protests organized by groups such as Ende Gel\u00e4nde have increasingly been making headlines. Thousands of young activists have come out to staged events, blocking railway tracks used to deliver coal to power plants near Cologne and occupying huge coal excavators, as seen here in the open-pit mine in the east German town of Welzow in 2016. In January 2019, after seven months of negotiations, a coal commission set up by the federal government to work out Germany's plans to phase out coal power released its findings. It recommended that Germany should continue coal mining until 2038, at the latest \u2014far too late for the country to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris climate accord. An increasing number of young people in Germany are demanding that the government find a way to meet the 1.5-degree target. The emerging Fridays for Future movement has been getting support from longtime environmentalists, teachers, academics and parents. They have called for all German coal-fired power plants to be shut down by 2030, and for renewable energy initiatives to be vastly expanded. Author: Gero Rueter ipj/rc (AFP, dpa,) Seen by many as unambitious, Germany's 2030 climate plan, released the day of a global climate strike and now approved by the government, reflects past public ambivalence to climate action. But that is quickly changing. (09.10.2019)\n\u00a0 The majority of Germans believe children should not be allowed to skip school to protest the climate crisis, according to a new poll.

{"id": null, "body": "     In the wake of the latest tsunami to hit the Indonesian coast, research shows how even slight sea-level rises linked to climate change could significantly increase the devastating effects of tidal waves. Following the extreme, earthquake-triggered tsunamis unleashed in the Indian Ocean in 2004 and Japan in 2011, a spate of disaster films like The Impossible have depicted doomsday tidal wave scenarios. Such fear of \"big water,\" in US President Donald Trump's parlance, was revived this week in the wake of the tsunami that has so far killed around 1,350 people in Indonesia. Yet just weeks before this latest disaster, a group of scientists predicted that tsunami impacts will indeed worsen due to sea-level rises related to climate change.\u00a0 \"Our research shows that sea-level rise can significantly increase the tsunami hazard, which means that smaller tsunamis in the future can have the same adverse impacts as big tsunamis would today,\" Robert Weiss, associate professor in the Department of Geosciences at Virginia Tech\u00a0told DW. Read more :\u00a0 Indonesia quake: 'Tsunami warning system needs improvement' Weiss was one of several authors\u00a0of a study published in Science Advances last month that, somewhat presciently, looked at tsunami impacts in a world of rising seas. Titled \"A modest 0.5-meter (1.5-foot)\u00a0rise in sea-level will double the tsunami hazard in Macau,\" the study was also co-authored by Adam Switzer, associate professor at Singapore's Earth Observatory. \"The tsunami like the one that occurred in Palu on Friday \u2014 that event in 50 years time may have been worse because sea levels are rising in that part of the world, and it's a very low-lying plain and it's likely to have started to experience increased flooding,\" Switzer told DW. On Friday, September 28, a massive tidal wave unleashed by a 7.5-magnitude quake slammed into the Indonesian city of Palu located on Sulawesi island. The impact washed away Palu's 300-meter (328 yard) double-arched bridge, plunging cars into the water. This satellite image from October 1 shows how Palu is built on lowlands at the end of a narrow bay. Scientists say the shape of the bay amplified the size and power of the waves by forcing the water into a narrow and shallow channel. The earthquake's epicenter was also located close to shore, making the waves more powerful and leaving little time for warning. The wave hit Palu, a city with a population of 380,000, on Friday evening as Muslim worshippers were gathering for evening prayers in local mosques. Authorities said that many others were caught on the beach while preparing a festival which was set to start later in the day. With local hospitals crowded by hundreds of wounded, doctors were forced to treat the injured outside. Komang Adi Sujendra, director of a Palu hospital, urged assistance. \"We need all the help we can get,\" he said. \"We need field hospitals, medical workers, medicines and blankets.\" On October 2, the official death toll of the tsunami and quake reached over 1,200. Authorities expect that number to rise as more people remain trapped. On October 1, the national disaster agency told AP that over 150 bodies were buried in a mass grave, with the burial operations ongoing. Indonesia is a majority-Muslim nation, and religious custom calls for burial soon after death. The tsunami carried sand, mud and debris inland. Roads were blocked and communications disrupted with other cities. Rescue efforts in remote areas around Palu was hampered by the extent of damage to infrastructure. More heavy equipment was also needed. The heavy earthquake caused sand and silt saturated by water to take on liquid characteristics in a process known as liquefaction. The national rescue agency said that over 1,700 houses in the Palu area were wiped out by liquefied soil. Authorities managed to open the local airport a day after the tsunami, allowing the Indonesian mlitary to start delivering aid. The country's President Joko Widodo (r) visited the island and pledged to rebuild the city. The Associated Press reported that Widodo has authorized international help. The EU and 10 countries including the US, Australia and China have offered assistance. Indonesian media showed images of survivors entering the heavily damaged malls and supermarkets to loot supplies, despite the risk of building collapse. Some Palu residents started returning to their homes to salvage usable items. German news agency dpa reported on October 2 that police arrested 45 people in Palu for looting. The earthquake and tsunami knocked out power to the island and left many residents without access to clean water and medical supplies. Some of them descended on gas stations to pump out fuel by hand for their generators. President Widodo has opened the door to foreign aid organizations as 200,000 people remain in desperate need of food, water and medicine. International Search and Rescue (ISAR) Germany has sent personnel to assist authorities. On October 11, authorities called off the search for missing people, leaving the whereabouts of around 5,000 people a mystery. Experts believe that many of the missing are buried underground after entire villages were swallowed by \"liquid earth.\" To commemorate the missing, parks and monuments are planned for Balaroa, Petobo and Jono Oge, considered the worst-hit areas of the island. Author: Darko Janjevic, Wesley Rahn Climate connection Scientists long assumed that tsunamis and rising sea levels were completely separate phenomena. Despite monitoring how rising sea levels will cause coastal communities to be inundated in storm surge conditions\u00a0\u2014 especially in low-lying island nations like the Solomon Islands \u00a0\u2014 few have tried to understand how this climate change symptom could exacerbate extreme weather and natural disasters. \"We really want to look at the extremes,\" said\u00a0Switzer, \"at the worse case scenarios.\" Using cutting-edge computer modeling which, according to Weiss, wasn't available five years ago, this latest research looks\u00a0at tsunami impacts at extreme high and king tides. In this vein, coastal cities like Macau in China that are currently regarded as \"tsunami safe,\" won't be in the future if sea-level rise predictions hold. \"Areas that are considered tsunami-safe and require a 2- to 3-meter tsunami for flooding, will only require a 1.5- to 2-meter tsunami,\" Switzer said. Read more:\u00a0 Will extreme weather become even deadlier? Worst-case scenario The problem will be further exacerbated since sea-level rises are now predicted\u00a0to be much higher than previously expected. \"What we thought was\u00a0the absolute worst case five or 10 years ago, is just a medium prediction today,\" Weiss said.\u00a0 Greater sea-level rises mean small tsunamis, which\u00a0happen more frequently, will also be more destructive. According to Weiss, smaller earthquake and tsunamis are much more frequent than the kind of massive event that caused the 2011 Tohoku tsunami in Japan. Thus, the tsunami triggered by that 9.1-magnitude\u00a0quake could be created by smaller tremors in a world of rising seas.

But such measures\u00a0will have little effect if sea-level rises double, triple or even quadruple the frequency and impact of\u00a0tsunamis. As such, the ultimate defense against this doomsday scenario will be climate change mitigation. \"Sea-level rise is primarily driven by our use of fossil fuels and our continuous production of carbon dioxide,\" said Switzer. \"You can't decouple these things, they're all linked.\" A recent study says five islands in the Solomons have vanished and others are suffering severe erosion.

{"id": null, "body": "     Lawmakers have approved a motion requiring the government to make proposals to \"restore the UK's natural environment.\" The move comes after protesters demonstrated for days, causing road closures and transit chaos. After a week and a half of protests in London by climate change activists, the British Parliament has declared a symbolic \"environment and climate change emergency.\" Lawmakers\u00a0backed\u00a0a call by Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party,\u00a0for \"rapid and dramatic action\" to protect the environment. The nonbinding motion calls on Prime Minister Theresa May's government to make proposals to Parliament in the next six months to\u00a0\"restore the UK's natural environment and to deliver a circular, zero-waste economy.\" The measure was passed as an opposition motion, using a procedure that the ruling party typically ignores, and has no direct consequences for policy. In mid-April, climate change activists from the Extinction Rebellion\u00a0protest group launched 11 days of protests in central London. The demonstrations caused road closures and paralyzed the London Underground transit system. The movement has also spread to Germany and other European countries. In reaction to the motion, the Extinction Rebellion tweeted that lawmakers have started \"to #TellTheTruth about climate change & ecological crisis.\" 'Ahead of politicians' In Parliament, Corbyn told lawmakers they should listen to those \"who have the most to lose\" from climate change. He described the younger generation\u00a0as being \"ahead of politicians on this, the most important issue of our time.\" \"We have no time to waste. We are living in a climate crisis that will spiral dangerously out of control unless we take rapid and dramatic action now,\" Corbyn told Parliament. \"Today, we have the opportunity to say, 'We hear you' ... By becoming the first parliament in the world to declare a climate emergency, we could, and I hope we do, set off a wave of action from parliaments and governments all around the world.\" No greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 Corbyn hopes the motion will increase pressure on the British government. He is demanding the country take\u00a0action to help avoid more than 1.5 degrees centigrade of warming, which would require\u00a0global emissions to be cut by almost half of 2010 levels by 2030. The Committee on Climate Change, an independent group that advises the British government, went a step further. In a\u00a0report\u00a0released on Thursday, it\u00a0said the government should effectively eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The report said the UK needed to rapidly adopt policies that change everything from the way people heat their homes to what they eat. It called for a reduced consumption of meat and dairy products, changes in how farmers operate and a requirement for electric vehicles to be the only option by 2035. The committee said the government needed to\u00a0be ambitious if it wanted to limit the impacts of climate change, saying that existing plans to achieve net-zero emissions \"must be greatly strengthened\" because \"current policy is not enough even for existing targets.\"\u00a0 Beginning April 15, protesters with Extinction Rebellion took to the streets of London and other cities to demand governments declare a climate and ecological emergency. They occupied key spots in the city, calling on those in charge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt biodiversity loss and set up citizens' assemblies on climate and ecological justice. Extinction Rebellion, founded last year by academics in the United Kingdom, is one of the world's fastest-growing environmental movements. Their aim is to protest climate change inaction in a creative and nonviolent way. Demonstrators say people are causing their own mass extinction, which is the basis of their \"rebellion.\" Harry and Meghan, the duke and duchess of Sussex, didn't exactly take part in the sit-in on London's Waterloo Bridge on April 18. The royals are expecting and protesters used the happy event in their demonstration, having the couple \"thank\" Extinction Rebellion for saving their child's future. Activists have used a variety of unusual protest methods to draw maximum attention and get their point across. Throughout the week, they've blocked traffic, climbed atop buses and superglued themselves to buildings and, in the case of this young man at London's Canary Wharf station on April 17, trains. The goal of the protests is to temporarily disrupt everyday life. As a result, police have arrested more than 800 people in London alone. Activists want to get the public on their side, but a YouGov survey showed that just 36% of more than 3,500 British polled support the protest, with 52% against. Extinction Rebellion protesters first attracted global attention on April 1, during yet another heated Brexit debate in the British Parliament. A group of semi-naked activists revealed themselves in the visitor gallery with slogans including \"SOS\" and \"Stop Wasting Time\" written on their bodies, with some gluing their hands to a glass barrier. The scene was quickly broken up my security. The Extinction Rebellion protests got their start in London, but the movement has also spread to other major cities around the world. On April 15, these activists on the Oberbaum Bridge in Berlin blocked traffic for hours. On April 21, organizers in London said they were willing to switch tactics and talk with the government. \"We're giving them an opportunity now to come and speak to us,\" said spokesman James Fox. \"If they refuse \u2026 then this is going to continue and this going to escalate in different, diverse and very creative ways.\" Author: Friedel Taube dv/cmk (AFP, dpa, Reuters) Every day, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.

{"id": null, "body": "     EU carbon pricing policies and the decommissioning of coal-powered plants are helping reduce emissions in Germany, a new government report says. But the trend did not apply to heating in homes and car use. Germany's greenhouse gas emissions continued to decline last year, according to a report published Monday by the Environment Ministry. The country emitted some 805 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2019, which was roughly 54 million tons or 6.3% less than in 2018, the report said. With the exception of the 2009 global economic crisis, Germany's emissions reduction in 2019 was the country's largest annual decline since 1990. Compared to then,\u00a0Germany has already reduced its emissions 35.7%. The German government has pledged an emissions reduction of at least 55% by 2030. The report attributed this development to the successful reform of European emissions trading , the low price of gas, the expansion of wind and solar energy, and the shutdown of the first coal-fired power plant units. Read more: \u00a0 Coronavirus and climate change: A tale of two crises Carbon pricing effective Most of the reductions were registered in Germany's energy sector, which saw a reduction of 51 million tonnes of CO2. That represents a 16.5% drop in emissions on the previous year.\u00a0A key factor is the use of gas-fired instead of coal-fired power plants. The report noted that the average price for one ton of CO2 in 2019 was almost twice as high as in 2018, making the operation of coal-fired power plants in 2019 often more expensive than that of gas-fired power plants. Germany's policy of decomissioning coal-fired power plants in 2019, with a total capacity of 3.5 gigawatts, and other measures had a positive effect, the report said. The country's agricultural sector also saw a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 2.3%. This was due to declining livestock numbers of cattle and pigs, as well as a 10.3% decline in mineral fertilizer sales. But the report cautioned that the reduction in agriculture could be in large part due to the consequences of very dry weather conditions last year. Germany also saw a hike in electricity production from renewable sources, such as wind and solar power. The report noted that this was due to sunnier and windier conditions, but also increased investment in those industries. Read more: \u00a0 Tackling climate change from Kyoto to Paris and beyond Emissions from housing and cars rise The report also noted a surge in emissions in housing and transportation. A key driver of the emissions in the housing sector was heating . According to the report, the price of heating oil was significantly lower in 2019 than in 2018. Germans are also still driving and as a result, gas consumption was also on the rise. The total number of motor vehicles in circulation grew by 1.6%. Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said the report was a positive sign for the future and urged for more expansion renewable energy sources, saying that ''electricity from wind and solar power is the basis for successful climate protection.'' ''Additional measures are needed in transportation policy and in housing, in order to create a trend of falling emissions in these areas too,'' Schulze said. The Federal Environment Agency President Dirk Messner praised the ministry's report, on which his organization collaborated. \"Germany is moving in the right direction towards the climate target for 2030, which is encouraging,\" Messner said.\u00a0 ''In principle, I see that Germany can achieve its climate targets. And Germany can achieve even more if we set the right course and exploit the opportunities in all sectors,'' Messner added, echoing Schulze's push for more renewable energy investments.

{"id": null, "body": "     Merkel is leaving office after 16 years. One of three candidates could succeed her. DW analyzed: What do they talk about in parliament? How do they vote? And what does that mean for their potential chancellorship? Who will succeed Angela Merkel (background)? Depending on the results of Germany's parliamentary election in September, it could be Olaf Scholz (SPD), Armin Laschet (CDU) or Annalena Baebock (Greens). In September 2021, Germany will elect a new federal parliament, and change chancellors, as well. Three major parties have put up candidates hoping to succeed Angela Merkel, who will not run again after 16 years in office. Merkel's own party, the Christian Democrats (CDU), nominated Armin Laschet for the candidacy. Laschet serves as state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. The Greens, meanwhile, made 40-year-old international law expert Annalena Baerbock their candidate, the party's first candidacy with real prospects of success. The Social Democrats (SPD) tipped Finance Minister Olaf Scholz as their top candidate. Voting records provide an overview of how the governing parties have implemented their promises and how the opposition parties have positioned themselves politically. In Germany, several parties usually form a majority coalition that votes unanimously, and whose motions will thus generally pass. Much depends, therefore, on the formation of the next coalition, and the deals struck in the process. For most of her time in office, Merkel oversaw a grand coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD, with the Greens in the opposition. Should the SPD go into the opposition after this election, it could cast its vote separately from the conservatives for the first time since 2013. And should the greens become a government party, they will have to compromise with their coalition partners. So what is each candidate's track record so far? And what does that tell us about Germany's future chancellor? To find the politicians' signature issues, DW assessed the words and phrases each of the candidates use more often than their competitors in parliamentary speeches. In recent years, the CDU chairman has been mostly active in state- and regional-level politics. That focus is reflected in his speeches, in which he mentions his home state and its political institutions more often than his fellow campaigners. His time as Integration and Family Minister from 2005 to 2010 also stands out, with mentions for parents, children and education. Annalena Baerbock's characteristic issues stand out in her parliamentary speeches: She mentions climate policy, Germany\u2019s coal phase-out and Europe more often than her competitors. Her home state of Brandenburg also makes an appearance: Baerbock comes from and is a member of parliament for Potsdam, near Berlin. The SPD politician is active in both state and federal politics. He was mayor of Hamburg from 2011 to 2018 and, accordingly, often speaks about the city and its local politics. As a former labor minister and current finance minister, he mentions workers and the economy more often than the other two candidates. Author: Kira Schacht Whether issues and policy positions of politicians are put into practice is partly decided in the federal and state parliaments. Here, political positions are discussed and new laws voted on. DW gathered all roll-call votes the candidates and Merkel participated in, recorded by the German parliamentary watchdog NGO Abgeordnetenwatch , and manually labeled them by international relevance and policy issue. What is their track record on migration, environmental policy, or European cooperation? Merkel's decision not to close the borders to refugees stranded in Hungary in 2015 was watched around the world. Overall, however, the chancellor's voting record on migration and refugee policy is rather mixed. Less than a quarter of her votes support a more open migration policy. Instead, her governing coalition voted, for example, against deportation stops for Syrian refugees , which the Greens had requested in 2011, or introduced a motion to classify Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Georgia as safe countries of origin in 2019. Political calculations play a big role in such votes, says Ulrich Sieberer , professor of empirical political science at the University of Bamberg: \"99% of the time, votes are about positioning yourself in the conflict between government and opposition.\" Opposition parties such as the Greens can introduce motions to parliament, but these have no chance of success without the support of the governing coalition. But they still serve a purpose, says Sieberer: \"From the opposition's point of view, it's an instrument to present one's own position to the voters, and to show up the government by occasionally forcing them to reject something popular.\" The SPD knows this dynamic well: As the CDU's coalition partner, the party often faces accusations of voting against its proclaimed ideals. \"At the end of the day, the parties stand together for the government line and, of course, have to be measured against it to some extent,\" Sieberer says. \"But, at the same time, of course, the battle over interpretation begins immediately.\" Parties might claim to have wanted a different outcome, but to have been forced to make concessions to the coalition partner. The Greens could be in that very position after the election. Should they become part of a government coalition, they would have to vote differently. \"They will only introduce motions that are sure to have the support of the coalition,\" says Sieberer. As an opposition party, the Greens have often introduced motions deemed too extreme by the governing parties. Among them are multiple requests for Germany to take in more refugees and asylum-seekers, including a motion \u00a0from March 2020 to admit some 5,000 people from overcrowded Greek camps. Baerbock and her party vote for more immigration and a more open refugee policy in almost all cases. By contrast, the SPD's Scholz and the CDU's Laschet have a relatively thin voting record on the topic. Publicly, the SPD politician spoke out in favor of accepting more refugees from Moria after fires destroyed the Greek camp in 2020. When large numbers of refugees arrived in Germany during 2015 and 2016, he pleaded for more European cooperation and faster processing procedures for asylum applications, but also advocated for stricter controls at the EU borders and more stringent deportation procedures. For Laschet, only two roll-call votes on the topic are recorded, both on opposition motions in state parliament. Generally, the CDU politician and former integration minister for North Rhine-Westphalia is seen as a\u00a0 staunch supporter of a multicultural society , and, in 2015, he backed Merkel's open refugee policy in the face of criticism. As Merkel's policy got stricter, though, so did his. German soldiers are currently deployed on a total of 11\u00a0missions around the world. These are generally decided on by the government, but most must be approved by parliament. The Greens voted against the army mission \"Resolute Support\" in Afghanistan, which ended in 2021. The Greens, as part of the opposition, have supported only some of these missions. For example, Baerbock has always voted along party lines against German military involvement in NATO's Sea Guardian operation, which is meant to ensure security in the Mediterranean, and against the missions in Iraq and Syria. Other missions have the support of the Greens, however, such as those in North Africa and Lebanon. Environmental policy is the key issue for the Greens. During Baerbock's time in the Bundestag, the Greens have repeatedly introduced motions on the topic, such as a fundamental ban on fracking , as well as an exit from coal by 2022 . Many of these motions have little chance of success and serve primarily to position themselves politically, Sieberer explains. But the Greens also generally support government motions that strengthen climate policy and nature conservation, except for protest votes on motions they deem insufficient. Repeatedly rejecting opposition motions drags down Merkel's own track record on climate policy. Still, Merkel and her ruling coalition support more than half of all motions for more climate and nature protection. Her government has helped introduce and implement some environmental policy decisions in recent years, such as the\u00a0 climate protection program 2030 and an increase in aviation tax rates . But she and her party also voted, for example, to cut solar power subsidies . Once again, there is less data on Laschet and Scholz, who more often vote on regional issues in state parliament. In his few roll-call votes on environmental issues, Laschet has voted against motions on animal welfare and\u00a0 environmental protection . In public, Laschet is often hesitant in his support of climate policies. In his home state, coal still plays a major role . This may be one reason the CDU candidate always emphasizes the importance of industry and economy when talking about climate protection. Motions on EU cooperation are usually introduced by the governing coalition and therefore mostly pass. On this issue, the Greens introduce fewer motions themselves, but support the CDU/CSU and their coalition partners in motions ranging from financial aid for Greece to the start of EU accession talks with Albania in 2019 to participation in the EU's pandemic crisis support in 2020. Being in the opposition, the Greens have agreed with the governing coalition surprisingly often in the past years, Sieberer notes: \"It seems a bit like they're preparing for possible future government participation. You can't disagree with everything if you want to govern together with the same people later.\" \u00a0 Olaf\u00a0Scholz\u00a0is the Social Democrats' candidate as German chancellor to succeed Angela Merkel. There is no doubting his experience \u2014 and he is known for his ability to handle a crisis.\u00a0But many say something is missing.\n\u00a0 Annalena Baerbock is said to be tough, talented and very ambitious. Now, Germany's Green Party has named her as its candidate for chancellor.

{"id": null, "body": "     Australia, a major coal exporter and one of the worst per capita emitters, goes to the polls Saturday. The result could be decisive for global climate goals, as voters demand lawmakers do more to cut emissions. Australians are already dealing with hellish wildfires, worsened by climate change The results of the Australian election this Saturday will set the climate agenda for one of the planet's worst per-capita CO2 emitters. It comes\u00a0as the world faces a rapidly closing window to stop the most severe impacts\u00a0of climate change. The country, dubbed a \"wrecker\" at climate change negotiations,\u00a0is a major exporter of fossil fuels, largely to East Asia and India. It\u00a0has been criticized\u00a0for grossly insufficient climate targets by the UK and US as well as its neighboring Pacific nations who could see their homes disappear as sea levels rise. Australians want action on climate change, but major parties have hardly mentioned the issue in their election campaigns At the same time, polls clearly show voters back stronger climate action in the \"sunburned land,\" having already experienced deadly and costly flooding and wildfires linked to climate change in recent years. Some big businesses, once against emissions cuts,\u00a0have also done a U-turn on climate policy. The country is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. \"Australians are feeling and seeing climate damage now and that's why most Australians are very worried about climate change and want the government to do a lot more than they are,\" said Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF). Despite public support, the major parties vying for votes in the tight election have barely mentioned the issue in their campaigns, said Peter Christoff, senior research fellow with Melbourne Climate Futures, which is part of the University of Melbourne. \"And that's really quite concerning and worrying,\" said Christoff. Wildfires in 2021: Australians are already feeling the effects of the climate crisis Since 2007, Australia's two major parties, the center-left Labor Party and the conservative Liberal Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison, have been in an open war over climate change policies, leading to multiple leaders being toppled. \"The public vitriol in political exchanges \u2014 particularly over an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon and carbon taxes \u2014 led to some of the ugliest politics we've seen in Australia over a 15-year period,\" said Christoff. Labor believes it lost the supposedly unlosable \"climate election\" in 2019 to the Liberals because of a backlash against its strong climate policies and job fears in key seats in coal-mining areas. Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter. And because of\u00a0the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising coal prices mean Australia will likely earn 100 billion Australian dollars (\u20ac67\u00a0billion, $70\u00a0billion) in one year from coal. Meanwhile, between 100,000 and 300,000 Australian jobs connected to coal, oil and gas are at risk if the country doesn't prepare for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to a study by independent Australian think tank, the Centre for Policy Development. To date, the conservatives\u00a0have stymied significant action on climate change \u2014 blocking a major emissions trading scheme,\u00a0 slashing funding on climate research, \u00a0subsidizing and allowing fossil fuel production to expand and abolishing the government-funded Climate Commission. At the 2021\u00a0UN climate conference in Glasgow, the government refused to budge from its 2030 emission cuts of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels \u2014\u00a0one of the weakest targets in the developed world. The UN Climate Action Tracker rates Australia's emissions and net-zero targets as \"poor\" and \"highly insufficient,\" putting it on a path to\u00a0more than 3 degrees Celsius warming. Going into the 2022 election, the Liberal Party\u00a0 pledged to go net-zero by 2050 , but has given itself scope to ignore this . At the same time, it has vowed to continue exports of Australia's coal and gas past 2050 and has included these fossil fuels in its domestic energy blueprint. Labor \u2014 currently forecast to win this election \u2014 has also vowed to go net-zero by 2050 and has stronger emission cuts of 43% by 2030 . It has\u00a0pledged tens of billions of dollars to revitalize the nation's energy grid and install solar banks and batteries. But it\u00a0says it won't stop exporting coal and gas. The Australian Green Party, as well as climate-minded independents, are seeing a surge in support Australia is dominated by two main parties, but by dragging their heels on climate change Labor and the Liberals have opened the door to new challengers. A group of independents, dubbed \"the teals,\" are competing with Liberal lawmakers\u00a0for urban seats. Mostly women, they\u00a0receive funding from a group called Climate 200 \u2014 a relatively new political fund\u00a0established by clean energy investor Simon Holmes a Court \u2014 and have campaigned on climate, integrity, and gender equality. They have all set ambitious 2030 emission reduction targets ranging from 50% to 70% by 2030. And they appear to be attracting moderate Liberal voters who have become disillusioned with a lack of movement on climate change. Most recent polling shows several key seats are at risk. Meanwhile, the Greens\u00a0have enjoyed a surge and are now polling at about 15% nationally \u2014 compared to 10% in the 2019 election. They have pledged to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 , go net-zero by 2035, phase out the mining, burning and exporting of coal by 2030 and convert the grid to 100% renewables. Depending on the result of the election, both the Greens and the teal candidates could wield significant power over the government. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg may lose his seat to a climate-friendly independent Businesses are also calling for more action. In one\u00a0example, Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes is attempting to use his wealth to force energy giant AGL to exit coal-fired power generation. Even the Business Council of Australia \u2014\u00a0which represents big\u00a0banks and corporations, such as industrial and retail giant Wesfarmers, mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto and airline Qantas\u00a0\u2014 is now also calling for major emission cuts by 2030. It's a dramatic shift for the organization that in 2018 called 45% emissions reduction cuts \"an economy wrecking target.\" \"It's certainly not the community that is holding back the Australian political parties on climate action and also not the business community,\" ACF's O'Shanassy said. \"Everyone wants climate action except for the people that go to Parliament House.\" But neither Labor nor the Liberals' targets are enough to bring Australia in line with its Paris Commitments. Emissions cuts of at least 50% by 2030 are what's required to keep it below the upper threshold of 2 degrees warming and about 75% for the 1.5-degree target, according to some estimates. ACF believes\u00a0 the next government should\u00a0take advantage of the country's\u00a0huge solar and wind potential and could quickly cut\u00a0emissions while preserving jobs by replacing fossil fuel\u00a0exports with products created with renewable energy such as hydrogen and ammonia. \"We need to use the vast amount of renewable energy we have in this country. We need to times it by about ten and then turn that into exports and stop exporting pollution to the world,\" O'Shanassy said. \"That would be our greatest contribution to climate change.\" Many countries around the world banned the usual New Year's fireworks to relieve pressure on hospitals swamped with COVID-19 cases. For Germany, that meant an estimated 3,500 tons of plastic waste saved. In Amsterdam, the taboo on home pyrotechnics looks set to endure, with the city organizing public displays instead. Europe and North America saw plunging temperatures, with many regions blanketed in deep snow. Arctic warming caused dips in the polar vortex and a weaker jet stream, conspiring to send chilly Arctic air south. Disruption of the jet stream can also have the reverse effect, sending warm air up from the tropics. We're yet to see which trend will dominate as the planet continues to heat up. Thousands of people had to leave their homes after heavy rain flooded towns in eastern Australia. Gladys Berejiklian, then the premier of New South Wales, a state that was particularly affected, called the inundation a \"one-in-100-year event.\" Some commentators argued that this kind of flooding is in fact becoming the new normal. Europe's biggest economy was given a reality check by its Constitutional Court, which declared the German Climate Protection Act unconstitutional for failing to include climate targets beyond 2030. The court said this would place too great a burden on future generations. The Bundestag toughened up the legislation with a commitment to go climate-neutral by 2045. In another landmark ruling, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered Shell to cut its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was the first time a private company has been legally forced to comply with the global agreement. \"This applies to the entire world, so also to Shell,\" the judge said. More than 230 people died during a heat wave in Canada, with record temperatures of nearly 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) recorded in Lytton, British Columbia. The following day, forest fires reduced much of the village to ash. This was also a summer of devastating blazes for California, Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey, and Siberia and the Amazon. In Central Europe, catastrophic heavy rain turned streams into raging rivers that inundated towns and villages as they burst their banks. In Germany's Rhineland, more than 180 people lost their lives. Parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also suffered extreme floods. Property damage in Germany alone was estimated at several billion euros. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report with an unequivocal message: The climate crisis is worse than we thought and humans are definitely to blame. The IPCC's assessment reports are the most detailed and comprehensive on the topic, in this case drawing on more than 14,000 peer-reviewed studies. At the UN General Assembly, Premier Xi Jinping announced that China would no longer build coal-fired power plants abroad \u2014 putting an end to a construction spree that has already seen hundreds of Chinese-backed coal power projects go up as part of its Belt and Road Initiative through Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. But Beijing continues to build new coal power plants at home. Concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere reached a new record in 2020. According to the report by the World Meteorological Organization, the year-on-year increase was higher than the average increase over the past decade, despite the economic fallout of the pandemic. The WMO announced the figures with the warning that \"we are way off track\" for the Paris Agreement targets. After a pandemic hiatus, the UN Climate Change Conference was back in 2021, but it struggled to decide the details of the Glasgow Climate Pact. With India and China resisting a commitment to phase out coal, the final text agreed only to a \"phasedown.\" For many, this was hugely disappointing, though not necessarily surprising. Greta Thunberg had already declared COP26 \"a global greenwash festival.\" With the year drawing to a close, the US was hit by more extreme weather as 36 tornadoes swept through six states and left devastation in their wake. Homes and businesses were demolished, while dozens of people were killed. President Biden announced an investigation into global heating's impact on the tornadoes. Soonafter, nearly 400 people died in the Philippines after Typhoon Rai hit.

Carved into a block of wood and given pride of place in the parlor of an old farmhouse 100 or so kilometers (around 62 miles) northwest of Berlin, is a quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe : Was du ererbt von deinen V\u00e4tern hast, erwirb es, um es zu besitzen . From his place at the head of a solid wooden table, farmer Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen recites the words that were also a feature of his western German childhood home.\u00a0 Loosely translated, they mean: To own your inheritance,\u00a0you have to use it well. He interprets them as a reminder of his \"duty\" to tend the land in his custody with such care, that when it passes to his children, it is in better condition than when he took it on. Read more:  Germany swelters under heat wave As a young man, Gr\u00fcnhagen left Lower Saxony and the family farm that dates back to the year 936 and has been running his own place in Germany's former East for almost three decades. During that time, he has seen changes, not only to his farm and the lively village where it's located, but to the country's political, societal and, increasingly, climate landscape . \"I'm not talking about the extremes, because we've always had them,\" he told DW, \"but about the growing period, which now starts earlier in the spring, even when we have a late winter like this one, when it was still very cold in January and February.\" Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen comes from a long line of farmers. He says the changing climate is having an impact on his crops Fatal frosts and punishing heat His is an arable farm of 1,300 hectares (3,212 acres) \u2014 part conventional, part organic \u2014 that grows 19 crop varieties including grains, peas, hemp, Jerusalem artichokes and corn. One of his signature plants is the humble potato, which has struggled to survive in this summer of no rain and temperatures edging towards 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). \"Potatoes don't like temperatures above 25 degrees, they stop growing properly,\" he said, adding that he invested in an irrigation system a few years ago. \"It doesn't stop the heat, but at least it keeps the plants alive.\" Where possible, he has begun to switch to varieties that lend themselves to warmer weather. But even that hasn't worked this year. \"We planted corn, but it was so dry that it didn't even germinate. The field is empty.\" For those crops that do germinate, there is still the very real threat of late spring frosts heavy enough to wipe out young plants that have been seduced into premature existence by unnaturally warm daytime temperatures. \"Grains start to grow earlier than they used to, the ear might already be in the stalk when there's a night frost,\" he said. \"That means the ear dies and you're left with nothing.\" Gr\u00fcnhagen's main crop is the potato. The edible tuber doesn't do well in high temperatures From the grain to the grape Hundreds of kilometers south-west, in the wine growing region of Rhein-Hesse, vigneron Adolf Dahlem is looking for ways to overcome similar challenges that he says are \"undeniably\" linked to climate change . \"The first really bad year was 2003. Nothing but sun for months on end,\" he told DW. \"We've had several early and warm years since then, and the gaps between them are getting shorter and shorter.\" Though unremitting sunshine might sound like a wine grower's dream, it's more complex than that. Apart from the same problems of plants that produce shoots before the fatal frost season is over, vignerons in the region are grappling with new strains of pests and ever earlier harvests. Read more:  Climate change and farming: 'Unpredictability is here to stay' When Dahlem was a child, the grapes were picked in October. But in recent years, the annual event has moved into September and even August. \"This early harvest goes hand-in-hand with high temperatures,\" he said. And therein lies the problem. \"If we're harvesting when it's around 30 C, the grapes and the must will also have a temperature of 30 degrees.\" Though Dahlem tries to harvest at night and in the early morning when the fruit is cooler, it takes \"a highly technological and energy-intensive process\" to keep the grapes at the right temperature to achieve \"the unique harmony of fruit and acidity\" for which the region's riesling is famed. Wine growers are dealing with vines that produce shoots earlier, leaving them vulnerable to frosts Some growers see an opportunity to experiment with different grape sorts to make red wines atypical for the region, but Dahlem says there's a real desire in the community to find ways to keep on producing top-quality riesling. \"We will try to adapt,\" he said. \"But it is really very hard to meet the market's expectations.\" From the ground up And that is becoming a common refrain. Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen anticipates a 50 percent drop in yield this year. \"It has consequences for the agricultural industry, for those who buy our grain or the starch factory that processes our potatoes.\" All he can do, he says, is to try and adapt to the changing conditions, to be selective in the crops he sows, to irrigate where possible, and to ensure his soil is as healthy as it can be. For the chairman of the German Federation of the Organic Food Industry (B\u00d6LW), Felix zu L\u00f6wenstein, the state of Germany's farming land is a pressing issue.\u00a0 He believes the country's agricultural system has been due a complete rethink for some time, but that climate change brings the need for a \"radical\" overhaul into even sharper relief.\u00a0 Citing the increasing incidence of extreme weather events such as drought and heavy rainfall, he says it's untenable to \"pretend that everything has to stay as it was, and from time to time ask for some public money to keep us alive.\" Read more:  Heat wave challenges German wine industry as it eyes changing trends He sees soil fertility, increased humus content and reduced soil compaction \u2014 both of which make it easier for the ground to absorb and store water \u2014 increased biodiversity and crop rotation as potential measures for long-term change. Many farmers have hit back at him for vocalizing these thoughts at a time when the relentless heat of the past months has filled many with an existential angst. \"They take it as a reproach,\" he said, \"and it makes me sad because that's the last thing I want to do.\" Rethinking European farming What he does want though, is to use the extremity of this summer as a catalyst for an earnest discussion about the future. He sees EU plans to rework its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) by 2020 as an opportunity to stop paying subsidies on the current per hectare basis under which large farms stand to benefit the most. \"We have to switch to a policy where farmers are paid for a service they're providing,\" he said. \"For measures that increase biodiversity, that make farming and food production more resilient.\" Experts say Germany and Europe's agricultural system needs a radical overhaul to deal with the impact of climate change Read more:  Opinion: The German farmers who moan until the cows come home Gr\u00fcnhagen, however, fears that a loss of the current subsidy system would lead to fallow land. \"In this region, we have light soil which means the earning potential is relatively low,\" he said, adding that the subsidies are a lifeline for many farmers. Without them, he predicts summers where \"large swathes of brown land\" stretch across the country because farmers would simply give up. He hopes it won't come to that, and for his part, vows to continue adapting and tending his land in keeping with his interpretation of Goethe's words, and with enough care to ensure there is something to pass onto the next generation. Even in the face of climate change. Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen has an arable farm a 90-minute drive north of Berlin. He says he has noticed climate change in the extended growing period of his crops. While even a few years ago, he had to harvest his potatoes by early October, he says that has changed, because the frosts no longer arrive as early in the year. Gr\u00fcnhagen expects to get at least this number of potatoes from each plant, but because they wither in temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit), keeping them healthy is not easy. The only option he has is to water them. Even so, this summer of extreme heat means he's looking at half his usual yield. He grows many different kinds of grain and says nothing about their harvest time has changed. Still, they sprout and grow earlier, making them more vulnerable to late frosts, which have not been eradicated by climate change. Where possible, he is now switching to crop varieties that can cope with more sun. Vintners are facing similar problems. In western Germany, warmer daytime temperatures in North Rhine-Westphalia's (NRW) wine-growing region coax vines into producing buds earlier than they used to. As with other plants, that makes them vulnerable on nights when the temperature falls below zero degrees Celsius. As they're particularly sensitive, once they've been bitten, they tend to die. Long summers of extreme heat also make the grapes ripen much earlier, meaning they have to be harvested earlier. The higher temperatures affect their taste. But keeping them cool enough during the wine-making process requires a huge technological effort. When possible, vintners try to pick the grapes in the middle of the night or in the early morning before they've absorbed the warmth of the day. Some in the NRW wine-making community see the changing weather patterns as an opportunity to experiment with growing grape sorts that previously couldn't have weathered the German climate. But they don't want to lose their long-standing reputation for producing the white wines for which the region has become globally well-known. There are calls from within Germany's farming community to rethink the country's entire food production system and to put more emphasis on improving the quality of the ground on which the nation relies. Measures such as planting more trees and bushes to stop drying winds, and preventing excessive soil compaction through the use of heavy machines could help. Healthy soil, says Felix zu L\u00f6wenstein, Chairman of the German Federation of the Organic Food Industry, has much to do with how much humus and how much life exists within it. The higher the content, the greater the soil's ability to absorb water, making it more resilient both in times of drought and extreme rainfall. Author: Tamsin Walker Earth's population is soaring, demand for more resource-intensive foods shows no sign of abating and climate change threatens to make farming in many regions even tougher. Growing plants without soil could be a solution.

World leaders meet the Queen of England at the G7 conference in Cornwall Criticism from health and environment campaigners followed the release of the final G7 communique. \"This G7 summit will live on in infamy,\" said Max Lawson, the head of inequality policy at international aid group Oxfam. \"Faced with the biggest health emergency in a century and a climate catastrophe that is destroying our planet, they have completely failed to meet the challenges of our times.\" \u00a0 Campaigners also complained that the G7\u00a0failed to go into details about how it will pay for a newly agreed \"Nature Compact\" \u2014 aimed to protect 30% of the world's land and oceans from further destruction by 2030. Additionally, the 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses for poorer countries falls far short of the 11 billion doses the World Health Organization said is needed to vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population and truly end the pandemic. Former British prime minister Gordon Brown said the lack of a more ambitious vaccination plan was \"an unforgivable moral failure.\" International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach meanwhile thanked \"G7 leaders for their support\" for the Tokyo games that were postponed for a year \u00a0due to the coronavirus pandemic. \"We take this as a great encouragement to deliver safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 for everybody in this spirit of worldwide solidarity,\" Bach said. US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden visited the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, following the end of the three-day G7 summit. The Bidens emerged from a Land Rover on Sunday to meet the awaiting queen before inspecting the Guard of Honor assembled on the castle grounds. US President Joe Biden and US First Lady Jill Biden headed to Windsor Castle to meet the British monarch The queen and the US first lady stayed on a dais as Biden walked along the guard. Once Sunday's inspection was completed, the queen and the Bidens headed into the castle for tea. Following the visit, Biden said \"I don't think she'll be insulted, but she reminded me of my mother.\" US President Joe Biden inspected the Guard of Honor during a visit to Windsor Castle US President Joe Biden said his fellow leaders agreed that \"America is back at the table and fully engaged,\" following a period of \"America First\" protectionist policy under former president Donald Trump. Here's a roundup G7 leaders' comments on Biden at the summit. A \"big breath of fresh air\" is how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, host of the summit in southwest England, described Biden, He told reporters Sunday that the G7 stood united anew in its \"democratic values.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel, attending her last G7 in the post, meanwhile said Biden had brought \"new momentum\" to resolving the world's problems at the three-day summit. French President Macron and US counterpart Biden hit it off during the G7 summit French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that it was a relief that he was now working with an American president who he termed was \"willing to cooperate.\" \"What you demonstrate is leadership is partnership,\" Macron said of Biden. Macron and Biden appeared to have built up quick chemistry during the in-person summit. The two draped their arms around each other and chatted animatedly when they walked together after the leaders' photo on Friday. US President Joe Biden said democracies were \"in a contest with autocratic governments around the world\" in his final address at the G7 conference. \"We're in a contest, not with China per se, ... with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in a rapidly changing 21st century,\" said Biden. He indicated Russia had its own problems to \"chew on,\" saying its president, Vladimir Putin, had not changed. \"Let me make it clear I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which in many cases he has not,\" Biden told reporters. The US president also stressed that his country was making a comeback in international diplomacy, following Trump. \"America's back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values,'' Biden said, before leaving Cornwall to visit Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. \"I think we've made progress in reestablishing American credibility among our closest friends.\" Biden said he does not view NATO as a \"protection racket.\" Trump had often criticized European member states for what he viewed as too low financial contributions to the organization. Biden also reported that global leaders were gratified that he accepted the science of climate change: \"One of the things some of my colleagues said to me when I was there was, 'Well, the United States' leadership recognizes there is global warming,''' Biden said. The final communique from the G7 meeting has been released to some media outlets.\u00a0 The document covers several topics On the coronavirus, the document: On climate change\u00a0and environment it: Pledges\u00a0to meet\u00a0$100 billion a year overdue funding to help poorer countries tackle climate change On Russia, the document: On other human rights issues, it: On China, it: On global economic issues, it: G7 leaders said in their draft communique that China must respect human rights in Xinjiang as well as allow Hong Kong freedoms. The group also expressed concern over what it called Beijing's growing influence in the East and South China Seas, and in the Taiwan Strait. \"We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,\" the\u00a0G7\u00a0said in the\u00a0communique that was almost finalized. Leaders also expressed concern over forced labor in China.\u00a0 \"The United States and our G7 partners remain deeply concerned by the use of all forms of forced labor in global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor of vulnerable groups and minorities and supply chains of the agricultural, solar, and garment sectors \u2014 the main supply chains of concern in Xinjiang,\" the document said. DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says G7\u00a0leaders have agreed to increase their financial support \"to make sure that they will be able to mobilize \u20ac100 billion for poorer nations to cope with the coincidences of climate change and to help them switch to clean energy.\"\u00a0 \"However, this promise was already made a decade ago and so far the leaders have not managed to live up to their promises,\" von Nahmen told DW.\u00a0Therefore, they are \"now saying they are definitely going to increase financial spending,\" she added. G7 leaders called for a\u00a0transparent, science-based study into the origins of COVID-19 convened by the World Health Organization, according to the draft communique.\u00a0 \"We\u00a0call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 COVID-19 Origins study including, as recommended by the experts\u2019 report, in\u00a0China,\" it said.\u00a0 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hopes that a new G7 task force can present details of the first infrastructure projects in developing countries in 2022. She also said that 2.3 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses should be distributed to low-income countries by\u00a0the end of next year. \"Germany is responsible for 350 million doses,\"\u00a0Merkel\u00a0said.\u00a0That includes 30 million doses that Germany had ordered and would distribute, she said. \"That will probably be more over time.\"\u00a0 The\u00a0G7\u00a0group has \"agreed that the pandemic can only be defeated globally,\" she said. \"The way out of the pandemic is vaccines,\" she stressed.\u00a0 Speaking about coal, for which the G7 leaders\u00a0are facing pressure to phase out state subsidies, Merkel said\u00a0the delegates had not\u00a0agreed on a date for ending the use of\u00a0the fossil fuel. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has joined the summit for its last day, urged the G7\u00a0to help finance the World Health Organization's\u00a0program\u00a0to increase COVID-19 testing, diagnostics and vaccines. \"We need to address the substantial financing gap for tests, treatments, critical supplies like oxygen and the health systems that enable testing, treatment and vaccination,\" Ramaphosa said in the presidency statement, referring to the\u00a0Access to the COVID-19 Tools Accelerator.\u00a0 \"If all\u00a0G7\u00a0countries met their fair share target, this initiative\u00a0would be two-thirds funded \u2013 and it would be 90% funded if all G20 countries made their fair share contributions,\" Ramaphosa said. G7 countries will provide one\u00a0billion COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next year and work with the private sector\u00a0and other countries to increase the contribution over the next months, according to a communique draft. \"The commitments since we last met in February 2021 including here in Carbis Bay provide for one\u00a0billion doses over the next year,\" the communique said. \"We will work together with the private sector, the G20 and other countries to increase this contribution over the months to come,\" it added. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lauded the vaccine pledge but said it's not enough. He said at least 11 billion doses are needed to\u00a0 vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population \u00a0by the middle of next year. \"We need more and we need them faster,'' Tedros said. DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says climate policy is a \"top priority\" for G7 countries. Speaking from Cornwall, England, where the G7 summit is taking place, von Nahmen\u00a0says leaders are expected to discuss the phasing out of diesel and patrol cars as well as ending the use of coal \"as soon as possible.\" She\u00a0added that the leaders are unlikely to specify a deadline. \u00a0 Concerning\u00a0relations between the West and China, von Nahmen said:\u00a0\"The US is pushing and hoping for a united front to counter China's rise,\" with European countries being \"very cautious not to push it too far to the extent that it would prevent any cooperation with China.\" \"What we expect from the (final) communique is to strike a balance, to stress that it is important to work on global issues with Beijing such as climate change,\" she said,\u00a0adding that the G7 would also be expected to \"call out China for human rights abuses\" and that the Chinese government should \"use fair methods to compete with western economies.\" Oxfam activists get creative at a climate protest at Swanpool Beach near Falmouth during the G7 summit The heads of state\u00a0plan to commit to steps to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources. The US, Germany, Britain and Canada say they intend to provide developing countries with up to $2 billion (\u20ac1.65 billion) to accelerate their phase-out of\u00a0coal. A White House statement also said that the\u00a0G7\u00a0would coordinate climate targets so that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as outlined in the Paris climate agreement\u00a0\u2014\u00a0remains \"within reach.\" British naturalist Sir David Attenborough is to\u00a0address\u00a0the G7 delegates by video link, warning that countries must take urgent action to avoid human-made environmental disasters. In remarks released ahead of his speech, Attenborough said global warming and loss of biodiversity are \"beyond doubt,\" as is the fact that \"our societies and nations are unequal.\" \"The question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether, as a result of these intertwined facts, we are on the verge of destabilizing the entire planet.\" \"If that is so, then the decisions we make this decade, in particular the decisions made by the most economically advanced nations, are the most important in human history,\" Attenborough added. The third and final day of the G7 summit takes\u00a0place in Cornwall, England, on Sunday. The UK wants to use the summit to coordinate global climate targets and persuade world leaders to agree on tougher climate measures, such as the phasing out of coal. The heads of state and government\u00a0will discuss steps on how to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources as well as how to\u00a0accelerate the phase-out of\u00a0coal. mvb/mm (AP, Reuters, dpa) The US leads efforts to create a western alternative to China's New Silk Road project, but the EU is wary of setting up an anti-China coalition.

{"id": null, "body": "     Political leaders from 64 countries and the European Union have committed to stronger environmental protections after a UN report found the world has failed to meet any of its biodiversity targets. Leaders from across the world have promised to turn environmental degradation around and put nature on the path to recovery within a decade. \u00a0 \"We are in a state of planetary emergency,\" the 65 leaders, who include German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, wrote ahead of a UN biodiversity summit on Wednesday. \"We commit ourselves not simply to words, but to meaningful action and mutual accountability.\" \u00a0 The commitments, which come two days before a UN\u00a0biodiversity summit in New York,\u00a0include eliminating plastic leakage to the oceans by 2050 and incentivizing banks and businesses to value the natural world. The leaders identify unsustainable production and consumption as a key driver of environmental crises that \"require urgent and immediate global action.\" \u00a0 But strongmen leading some of the world's biggest polluters \u2014 US, China, India, Russia and Brazil \u2014 are not among the signatories.\u00a0 Missed targets The pledge follows the September publication of a landmark assessment of biodiversity which showed humanity had failed to fully achieve\u00a0any of the 20 global biodiversity targets set by the UN ten years ago. Just six of them had been \"partly achieved\", the report said. For one goal, on protecting coral reefs , the world was found to be\u00a0moving in the opposite direction. An oil spill in Mauritius in July is threatening coral reefs and other areas of rich biodiversity Indigenous people in Brazil blocked a highway in August that has enabled deforestation of the Amazon rainforest Data from individual governments shows\u00a0that a third of national biodiversity targets, which are set by the countries themselves, are on track to be met or exceeded. But these are less ambitious than the UN targets and less than a quarter match up well with the global goals to protect nature. The vision for biodiversity set out in 2010 is only achievable if the world responds to \"compelling evidence\" that \"transformative change\" is required, said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity, which prepared the Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO) report. The charge sheet is long. Pollution from plastics and pesticides have not been brought down to safe levels. Governments still subsidize businesses that damage ecosystems . Coral reefs, which are dying across the world, are struck by the triple-threat of human action: climate change, pollution and overfishing. Some of those drivers are getting worse. Fish populations are recovering in waters managed by sustainable fishing policies More than 3 billion people rely on fish for 20% of their daily protein intake And even where there is progress, it is rarely enough. Deforestation should have been halted by now, but\u00a0has only been cut by a third, with Asia and Europe gaining forests while Africa and South America lose them at a faster rate. Conservation efforts have saved species like the Puerto Rican amazon parrot and the Mongolian Przewalski's horse. But they have failed to keep others like the Western Black Rhino or the Christmas Island pipistrelle from being wiped out forever. While the big trends in biodiversity loss were already known, the UN report included \"systematic analysis\" on how well the world has achieved the 2010 targets, said Josef Settele, an ecologist at the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany, who contributed research to the report but was not involved in writing it.\u00a0 \"There is also some brightness,\" Settele added. \"The things we are doing are not completely in vain.\" For instance, almost 100 countries have incorporated biodiversity values into national accounting systems. Over the last 20 years, the world has increased the share of protected areas from 10% to 15% on land and from 3% to 7% in water. There are now more fish in waters managed by good fishing policies. Governments are increasingly eradicating invasive species from islands. And since 1993, conservation actions have prevented the extinction\u00a0of between 28 and 48 bird and mammal species, according to a study published this month in the journal Conservation Letters \u2014 though many remain highly threatened and may still become extinct. \"The progress toward conserving life on earth has been much greater than it would have been [without action],\" said Thomas Brooks, chief scientist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, who was a co-author of the Conservation Letters study but was not involved in the GBO. \"The absolutely key question is how to scale up from where things currently are, in terms of responses, to meet targets comprehensively.\" Bee populations are falling because of intensive farming, pesticides, pollution and climate change Damage to ecosystems puts food security at risk The way to get that scale, according to the GBO report, is by \"mainstreaming\" the opportunities and responsibilities from protecting nature. That means every level of society \u2014 from individuals and local communities to businesses and national governments \u2014 would need to factor biodiversity into their economic decisions. Like climate change, ecological collapse is happening at breakneck speed. A 2019 report by IPBES, the UN panel of biodiversity experts, found that humans are altering the natural world at an \"unprecedented pace\" and threatening 1 million animal and plant species with extinction. Scientists say both issues require systemic changes, but individual actions can help. Agriculture is one of the greatest drivers of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. A study published in the journal Nature this month found that more than two-thirds\u00a0of future biodiversity losses could be avoided by conserving and restoring land, reducing food waste and switching to more plant-based diets. They are among many actions laid out in the GBO report to reduce and eventually restore lost biodiversity. If we do not act faster, said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Program, \"biodiversity will continue to buckle\" under the weight of overexploitation, climate change, pollution, invasive alien species and changes to land and sea. \"This will further damage human health, economies and societies \u2014\u00a0with particularly detrimental effects on indigenous peoples and local communities.\" This is an updated version of an earlier article. Why do we find it so hard to change our behavior? German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk explains how this is connected to the climate crisis.\n\u00a0 A UN-backed report says a million species are at risk of extinction, and warns biodiversity loss and failure to conserve ecosystems has catastrophic effects on people as well as nature. \n\u00a0 While endangered species such as the spiny seahorse have started to recolonize former habitats due to coronavirus lockdowns, a new study confirms that the number of extinction-threatened species is rising fast. \n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Countries pledge to reverse destruction of nature after missing biodiversity targets", "article_name": "global-biodiversity-outlook-targets-extinction-summit-new-york-pledge", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/global-biodiversity-outlook-targets-extinction-summit-new-york-pledge/a-54932895", "date_published": "2020-09-28 00:00:00", "article_length": 7175, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T06:05:43.325858"}

Australians are already dealing with hellish wildfires, worsened by climate change The results of the Australian election this Saturday will set the climate agenda for one of the planet's worst per-capita CO2 emitters. It comes\u00a0as the world faces a rapidly closing window to stop the most severe impacts\u00a0of climate change. The country, dubbed a \"wrecker\" at climate change negotiations,\u00a0is a major exporter of fossil fuels, largely to East Asia and India. It\u00a0has been criticized\u00a0for grossly insufficient climate targets by the UK and US as well as its neighboring Pacific nations who could see their homes disappear as sea levels rise. Australians want action on climate change, but major parties have hardly mentioned the issue in their election campaigns At the same time, polls clearly show voters back stronger climate action in the \"sunburned land,\" having already experienced deadly and costly flooding and wildfires linked to climate change in recent years. Some big businesses, once against emissions cuts,\u00a0have also done a U-turn on climate policy. The country is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. \"Australians are feeling and seeing climate damage now and that's why most Australians are very worried about climate change and want the government to do a lot more than they are,\" said Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF). Despite public support, the major parties vying for votes in the tight election have barely mentioned the issue in their campaigns, said Peter Christoff, senior research fellow with Melbourne Climate Futures, which is part of the University of Melbourne. \"And that's really quite concerning and worrying,\" said Christoff. Wildfires in 2021: Australians are already feeling the effects of the climate crisis Since 2007, Australia's two major parties, the center-left Labor Party and the conservative Liberal Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison, have been in an open war over climate change policies, leading to multiple leaders being toppled. \"The public vitriol in political exchanges \u2014 particularly over an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon and carbon taxes \u2014 led to some of the ugliest politics we've seen in Australia over a 15-year period,\" said Christoff. Labor believes it lost the supposedly unlosable \"climate election\" in 2019 to the Liberals because of a backlash against its strong climate policies and job fears in key seats in coal-mining areas. Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter. And because of\u00a0the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising coal prices mean Australia will likely earn 100 billion Australian dollars (\u20ac67\u00a0billion, $70\u00a0billion) in one year from coal. Meanwhile, between 100,000 and 300,000 Australian jobs connected to coal, oil and gas are at risk if the country doesn't prepare for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to a study by independent Australian think tank, the Centre for Policy Development. To date, the conservatives\u00a0have stymied significant action on climate change \u2014 blocking a major emissions trading scheme,\u00a0 slashing funding on climate research, \u00a0subsidizing and allowing fossil fuel production to expand and abolishing the government-funded Climate Commission. At the 2021\u00a0UN climate conference in Glasgow, the government refused to budge from its 2030 emission cuts of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels \u2014\u00a0one of the weakest targets in the developed world. The UN Climate Action Tracker rates Australia's emissions and net-zero targets as \"poor\" and \"highly insufficient,\" putting it on a path to\u00a0more than 3 degrees Celsius warming. Going into the 2022 election, the Liberal Party\u00a0 pledged to go net-zero by 2050 , but has given itself scope to ignore this . At the same time, it has vowed to continue exports of Australia's coal and gas past 2050 and has included these fossil fuels in its domestic energy blueprint. Labor \u2014 currently forecast to win this election \u2014 has also vowed to go net-zero by 2050 and has stronger emission cuts of 43% by 2030 . It has\u00a0pledged tens of billions of dollars to revitalize the nation's energy grid and install solar banks and batteries. But it\u00a0says it won't stop exporting coal and gas. The Australian Green Party, as well as climate-minded independents, are seeing a surge in support Australia is dominated by two main parties, but by dragging their heels on climate change Labor and the Liberals have opened the door to new challengers. A group of independents, dubbed \"the teals,\" are competing with Liberal lawmakers\u00a0for urban seats. Mostly women, they\u00a0receive funding from a group called Climate 200 \u2014 a relatively new political fund\u00a0established by clean energy investor Simon Holmes a Court \u2014 and have campaigned on climate, integrity, and gender equality. They have all set ambitious 2030 emission reduction targets ranging from 50% to 70% by 2030. And they appear to be attracting moderate Liberal voters who have become disillusioned with a lack of movement on climate change. Most recent polling shows several key seats are at risk. Meanwhile, the Greens\u00a0have enjoyed a surge and are now polling at about 15% nationally \u2014 compared to 10% in the 2019 election. They have pledged to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 , go net-zero by 2035, phase out the mining, burning and exporting of coal by 2030 and convert the grid to 100% renewables. Depending on the result of the election, both the Greens and the teal candidates could wield significant power over the government. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg may lose his seat to a climate-friendly independent Businesses are also calling for more action. In one\u00a0example, Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes is attempting to use his wealth to force energy giant AGL to exit coal-fired power generation. Even the Business Council of Australia \u2014\u00a0which represents big\u00a0banks and corporations, such as industrial and retail giant Wesfarmers, mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto and airline Qantas\u00a0\u2014 is now also calling for major emission cuts by 2030. It's a dramatic shift for the organization that in 2018 called 45% emissions reduction cuts \"an economy wrecking target.\" \"It's certainly not the community that is holding back the Australian political parties on climate action and also not the business community,\" ACF's O'Shanassy said. \"Everyone wants climate action except for the people that go to Parliament House.\" But neither Labor nor the Liberals' targets are enough to bring Australia in line with its Paris Commitments. Emissions cuts of at least 50% by 2030 are what's required to keep it below the upper threshold of 2 degrees warming and about 75% for the 1.5-degree target, according to some estimates. ACF believes\u00a0 the next government should\u00a0take advantage of the country's\u00a0huge solar and wind potential and could quickly cut\u00a0emissions while preserving jobs by replacing fossil fuel\u00a0exports with products created with renewable energy such as hydrogen and ammonia. \"We need to use the vast amount of renewable energy we have in this country. We need to times it by about ten and then turn that into exports and stop exporting pollution to the world,\" O'Shanassy said. \"That would be our greatest contribution to climate change.\" Many countries around the world banned the usual New Year's fireworks to relieve pressure on hospitals swamped with COVID-19 cases. For Germany, that meant an estimated 3,500 tons of plastic waste saved. In Amsterdam, the taboo on home pyrotechnics looks set to endure, with the city organizing public displays instead. Europe and North America saw plunging temperatures, with many regions blanketed in deep snow. Arctic warming caused dips in the polar vortex and a weaker jet stream, conspiring to send chilly Arctic air south. Disruption of the jet stream can also have the reverse effect, sending warm air up from the tropics. We're yet to see which trend will dominate as the planet continues to heat up. Thousands of people had to leave their homes after heavy rain flooded towns in eastern Australia. Gladys Berejiklian, then the premier of New South Wales, a state that was particularly affected, called the inundation a \"one-in-100-year event.\" Some commentators argued that this kind of flooding is in fact becoming the new normal. Europe's biggest economy was given a reality check by its Constitutional Court, which declared the German Climate Protection Act unconstitutional for failing to include climate targets beyond 2030. The court said this would place too great a burden on future generations. The Bundestag toughened up the legislation with a commitment to go climate-neutral by 2045. In another landmark ruling, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered Shell to cut its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was the first time a private company has been legally forced to comply with the global agreement. \"This applies to the entire world, so also to Shell,\" the judge said. More than 230 people died during a heat wave in Canada, with record temperatures of nearly 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) recorded in Lytton, British Columbia. The following day, forest fires reduced much of the village to ash. This was also a summer of devastating blazes for California, Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey, and Siberia and the Amazon. In Central Europe, catastrophic heavy rain turned streams into raging rivers that inundated towns and villages as they burst their banks. In Germany's Rhineland, more than 180 people lost their lives. Parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also suffered extreme floods. Property damage in Germany alone was estimated at several billion euros. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report with an unequivocal message: The climate crisis is worse than we thought and humans are definitely to blame. The IPCC's assessment reports are the most detailed and comprehensive on the topic, in this case drawing on more than 14,000 peer-reviewed studies. At the UN General Assembly, Premier Xi Jinping announced that China would no longer build coal-fired power plants abroad \u2014 putting an end to a construction spree that has already seen hundreds of Chinese-backed coal power projects go up as part of its Belt and Road Initiative through Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. But Beijing continues to build new coal power plants at home. Concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere reached a new record in 2020. According to the report by the World Meteorological Organization, the year-on-year increase was higher than the average increase over the past decade, despite the economic fallout of the pandemic. The WMO announced the figures with the warning that \"we are way off track\" for the Paris Agreement targets. After a pandemic hiatus, the UN Climate Change Conference was back in 2021, but it struggled to decide the details of the Glasgow Climate Pact. With India and China resisting a commitment to phase out coal, the final text agreed only to a \"phasedown.\" For many, this was hugely disappointing, though not necessarily surprising. Greta Thunberg had already declared COP26 \"a global greenwash festival.\" With the year drawing to a close, the US was hit by more extreme weather as 36 tornadoes swept through six states and left devastation in their wake. Homes and businesses were demolished, while dozens of people were killed. President Biden announced an investigation into global heating's impact on the tornadoes. Soonafter, nearly 400 people died in the Philippines after Typhoon Rai hit.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change is happening more rapidly than anyone though possible, the German government's expert, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, warned in an interview. The earth is heating up faster than many realize The threats posed by climate change are worse than those imagined by most governments, warned Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the scientist who heads the Potsdam Institute for Research on Global Warming Effects and acts as an adviser to German Chancellor Angela Merkel on climate-change issues. Schellnhuber warns that previous predictions about climate change and its catastrophic effects were too cautious and optimistic. \"In nearly all areas, the developments are occurring more quickly than it has been assumed up until now,\" Schellnhuber told the Saarbruecker Zeitung newspaper in an interview published Monday, Dec. 29. \"We are on our way to a destabilization of the world climate that has advanced much further than most people or their governments realize.\" Melting ice, rising water levels Ice in Greenland is melting fast The Arctic sea ice is melting more quickly than expected. There are also signs that the entire climate pattern at the North Poll has been disrupted to the extent of causing irreversible change. For the Arctic, the global warming which has already occurred of 0.8 degrees Celsius has already stepped over the line, Schellnhuber said. If Greenland's ice cap ice melts completely, water levels will rise by seven meters (23 feet). \"The current coastline will no longer exist, and that includes in Germany,\" he said. All countries need to sign on Will Europe's shift towards renewable energy be fast enough? In order to stop global warming, global CO2 emissions would need to be halved by 2050. For industrial countries, that would mean a decrease of 80 to 90 percent. By 2020, this process has to be well underway. \"When only one side fails to act, industrial countries or developing countries, than a disastrous climate change will be inevitable,\" he said. European lawmakers have given the final thumbs up to a package of measures to fight climate change. Being hyped as the most ambitious environmental package ever, the next challenge will be implementation.

{"id": null, "body": "     Despite government promises of a green COVID recovery, a new report says the world missed a \"historic chance\" to boost clean energy. Carbon dioxide emissions tied to energy were up 6% in 2021 Even with record growth in renewable energy last year, fossil fuels continue to dominate the world's energy use,\u00a0with the overall share in global energy consumption rising just under eight percentage points over the last decade. In its annual overview of the renewable energy sector, international policy network REN21 said the share of renewables in the world's energy consumption had stagnated, despite increased investment. The sector, which provided around 20% of the world's energy needs in 2011, accounted for just over 28% in 2021. The gains made in 2021 were overshadowed by an estimated 4% rise in energy consumption as the world slowly started to bounce back from COVID lockdowns , an increase that was primarily met by fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. \"Although many more governments committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2021, the reality is that, in response to the energy crisis, most countries have gone back to seeking out new sources of fossil fuels and to burning even more coal, oil and natural gas,\" said Rana Adib, executive director at REN21, ahead of the release of the report. The result is that\u00a0 carbon dioxide emissions tied to energy soared last year to a record 36.3 billion metric tons \u2014 up 6% to their highest level ever, according to the International Energy Agency. The report did have some good news. Around $366 billion (\u20ac350 billion) was invested in the renewable energy sector in 2021, according to figures provided by REN21, rising for the fourth consecutive year. And for the first time, more than 10% of the world's electricity was provided by solar and wind power. But those investments paled in comparison to fossil fuel subsidies, which amounted to $18 trillion between 2018 and 2020 \u2014 $5.9 trillion in 2020 alone. \"Governments largely failed to make decarbonization a focus in their post-pandemic economic recovery packages , with only a small fraction of the billions spent dedicated to accelerating the energy transition to bring down emissions,\" wrote Climate Action Tracker, an independent research coalition, in a recent analysis . \"Instead, they missed a massive opportunity, spending the lion's share of those packages on maintaining the status quo.\" That was made clear in the lead-up to the COP26 climate conference in November last year. Of the many net-zero pledges made ahead of the crucial meeting, only 84 countries had economy-wide renewable energy targets, and only 36 for 100% renewables. The assessment by Climate Action Tracker was shared by three academics from Johns Hopkins University, in a March commentary in the journal \"Nature .\" \"Today's green investments are proportionately less than those that followed previous recessions,\" they said. \"After the global financial crisis in 2007\u201309, for example, 16% of global stimulus spending was directed at emissions cuts (or about $520 billion of $3.25 trillion in total). If a similar share had been committed today, the total would be $2.2 trillion \u2014 more than double what has been pledged towards reducing emissions.\" Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine , and the resulting global sanctions against Moscow, have aggravated the global energy crisis and threatened to cut off exports of natural gas and oil, especially in Europe. Though the European Union agreed earlier this month to ban around 90% of Russian exports of crude and oil products\u00a0into the bloc over the next eight months, certain countries \u2014 like Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic \u2014\u00a0 said they could not entirely stop imports. And the bloc has yet to figure out how to cut its dependency on Russian gas, with Germany one of its biggest customers. Some 58% of nearly 2000 German companies said they would not be able to replace fossil gas in the short term, while 14% had seen a drop in production since the start of the war, according to a survey conducted by Germany's\u00a0Institute for Employment Research (IAB).\u00a0 Adib of REN21 said recent developments have only highlighted the need for a swift global transition to renewables, calling them \"the most affordable and best solution to tackle energy price fluctuations,\" as well as a way to provide energy independence.\u00a0 Speaking with DW in September, following Germany's federal election, she said the country needed to take the lead in driving an integrated \"transition from fossil-fuel based economy to a renewables-based economy,\" though she added that the country still had far to go. \"[The transition] needs to be anchored in any economic activity and any political activity. And Germany, who has been a historic front-runner in terms of the development of the energy transition, clearly has a big task today to take a lead and drive the integrated transition [\u2026] but also be an inspiration for other governments globally.\" Edited by: Jennifer Collins The oil and gas industry is choking the atmosphere with a heat-trapping gas stronger than CO2 \u2014 despite cheap, fast and easy fixes. \u00a0 A pandemic recovery plan to be thrashed out at this weekend's G20 summit is to have strong climate conditions, even with 'climate villain' Saudi Arabia at the helm. \u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Climate crisis: Fossil fuels still dominate, renewables growth too slow", "article_name": "despite-renewables-growth-fossil-fuels-still-dominate", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/despite-renewables-growth-fossil-fuels-still-dominate/a-62134789", "date_published": "2022-06-15 00:00:00", "article_length": 5399, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T08:24:28.334405"}
{"id": null, "body": "     Merkel is leaving office after 16 years. One of three candidates could succeed her. DW analyzed: What do they talk about in parliament? How do they vote? And what does that mean for their potential chancellorship? Who will succeed Angela Merkel (background)? Depending on the results of Germany's parliamentary election in September, it could be Olaf Scholz (SPD), Armin Laschet (CDU) or Annalena Baebock (Greens). In September 2021, Germany will elect a new federal parliament, and change chancellors, as well. Three major parties have put up candidates hoping to succeed Angela Merkel, who will not run again after 16 years in office. Merkel's own party, the Christian Democrats (CDU), nominated Armin Laschet for the candidacy. Laschet serves as state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. The Greens, meanwhile, made 40-year-old international law expert Annalena Baerbock their candidate, the party's first candidacy with real prospects of success. The Social Democrats (SPD) tipped Finance Minister Olaf Scholz as their top candidate. Voting records provide an overview of how the governing parties have implemented their promises and how the opposition parties have positioned themselves politically. In Germany, several parties usually form a majority coalition that votes unanimously, and whose motions will thus generally pass. Much depends, therefore, on the formation of the next coalition, and the deals struck in the process. For most of her time in office, Merkel oversaw a grand coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD, with the Greens in the opposition. Should the SPD go into the opposition after this election, it could cast its vote separately from the conservatives for the first time since 2013. And should the greens become a government party, they will have to compromise with their coalition partners. So what is each candidate's track record so far? And what does that tell us about Germany's future chancellor? To find the politicians' signature issues, DW assessed the words and phrases each of the candidates use more often than their competitors in parliamentary speeches. In recent years, the CDU chairman has been mostly active in state- and regional-level politics. That focus is reflected in his speeches, in which he mentions his home state and its political institutions more often than his fellow campaigners. His time as Integration and Family Minister from 2005 to 2010 also stands out, with mentions for parents, children and education. Annalena Baerbock's characteristic issues stand out in her parliamentary speeches: She mentions climate policy, Germany\u2019s coal phase-out and Europe more often than her competitors. Her home state of Brandenburg also makes an appearance: Baerbock comes from and is a member of parliament for Potsdam, near Berlin. The SPD politician is active in both state and federal politics. He was mayor of Hamburg from 2011 to 2018 and, accordingly, often speaks about the city and its local politics. As a former labor minister and current finance minister, he mentions workers and the economy more often than the other two candidates. Author: Kira Schacht Whether issues and policy positions of politicians are put into practice is partly decided in the federal and state parliaments. Here, political positions are discussed and new laws voted on. DW gathered all roll-call votes the candidates and Merkel participated in, recorded by the German parliamentary watchdog NGO Abgeordnetenwatch , and manually labeled them by international relevance and policy issue. What is their track record on migration, environmental policy, or European cooperation? Merkel's decision not to close the borders to refugees stranded in Hungary in 2015 was watched around the world. Overall, however, the chancellor's voting record on migration and refugee policy is rather mixed. Less than a quarter of her votes support a more open migration policy. Instead, her governing coalition voted, for example, against deportation stops for Syrian refugees , which the Greens had requested in 2011, or introduced a motion to classify Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Georgia as safe countries of origin in 2019. Political calculations play a big role in such votes, says Ulrich Sieberer , professor of empirical political science at the University of Bamberg: \"99% of the time, votes are about positioning yourself in the conflict between government and opposition.\" Opposition parties such as the Greens can introduce motions to parliament, but these have no chance of success without the support of the governing coalition. But they still serve a purpose, says Sieberer: \"From the opposition's point of view, it's an instrument to present one's own position to the voters, and to show up the government by occasionally forcing them to reject something popular.\" The SPD knows this dynamic well: As the CDU's coalition partner, the party often faces accusations of voting against its proclaimed ideals. \"At the end of the day, the parties stand together for the government line and, of course, have to be measured against it to some extent,\" Sieberer says. \"But, at the same time, of course, the battle over interpretation begins immediately.\" Parties might claim to have wanted a different outcome, but to have been forced to make concessions to the coalition partner. The Greens could be in that very position after the election. Should they become part of a government coalition, they would have to vote differently. \"They will only introduce motions that are sure to have the support of the coalition,\" says Sieberer. As an opposition party, the Greens have often introduced motions deemed too extreme by the governing parties. Among them are multiple requests for Germany to take in more refugees and asylum-seekers, including a motion \u00a0from March 2020 to admit some 5,000 people from overcrowded Greek camps. Baerbock and her party vote for more immigration and a more open refugee policy in almost all cases. By contrast, the SPD's Scholz and the CDU's Laschet have a relatively thin voting record on the topic. Publicly, the SPD politician spoke out in favor of accepting more refugees from Moria after fires destroyed the Greek camp in 2020. When large numbers of refugees arrived in Germany during 2015 and 2016, he pleaded for more European cooperation and faster processing procedures for asylum applications, but also advocated for stricter controls at the EU borders and more stringent deportation procedures. For Laschet, only two roll-call votes on the topic are recorded, both on opposition motions in state parliament. Generally, the CDU politician and former integration minister for North Rhine-Westphalia is seen as a\u00a0 staunch supporter of a multicultural society , and, in 2015, he backed Merkel's open refugee policy in the face of criticism. As Merkel's policy got stricter, though, so did his. German soldiers are currently deployed on a total of 11\u00a0missions around the world. These are generally decided on by the government, but most must be approved by parliament. The Greens voted against the army mission \"Resolute Support\" in Afghanistan, which ended in 2021. The Greens, as part of the opposition, have supported only some of these missions. For example, Baerbock has always voted along party lines against German military involvement in NATO's Sea Guardian operation, which is meant to ensure security in the Mediterranean, and against the missions in Iraq and Syria. Other missions have the support of the Greens, however, such as those in North Africa and Lebanon. Environmental policy is the key issue for the Greens. During Baerbock's time in the Bundestag, the Greens have repeatedly introduced motions on the topic, such as a fundamental ban on fracking , as well as an exit from coal by 2022 . Many of these motions have little chance of success and serve primarily to position themselves politically, Sieberer explains. But the Greens also generally support government motions that strengthen climate policy and nature conservation, except for protest votes on motions they deem insufficient. Repeatedly rejecting opposition motions drags down Merkel's own track record on climate policy. Still, Merkel and her ruling coalition support more than half of all motions for more climate and nature protection. Her government has helped introduce and implement some environmental policy decisions in recent years, such as the\u00a0 climate protection program 2030 and an increase in aviation tax rates . But she and her party also voted, for example, to cut solar power subsidies . Once again, there is less data on Laschet and Scholz, who more often vote on regional issues in state parliament. In his few roll-call votes on environmental issues, Laschet has voted against motions on animal welfare and\u00a0 environmental protection . In public, Laschet is often hesitant in his support of climate policies. In his home state, coal still plays a major role . This may be one reason the CDU candidate always emphasizes the importance of industry and economy when talking about climate protection. Motions on EU cooperation are usually introduced by the governing coalition and therefore mostly pass. On this issue, the Greens introduce fewer motions themselves, but support the CDU/CSU and their coalition partners in motions ranging from financial aid for Greece to the start of EU accession talks with Albania in 2019 to participation in the EU's pandemic crisis support in 2020. Being in the opposition, the Greens have agreed with the governing coalition surprisingly often in the past years, Sieberer notes: \"It seems a bit like they're preparing for possible future government participation. You can't disagree with everything if you want to govern together with the same people later.\" \u00a0 Olaf\u00a0Scholz\u00a0is the Social Democrats' candidate as German chancellor to succeed Angela Merkel. There is no doubting his experience \u2014 and he is known for his ability to handle a crisis.\u00a0But many say something is missing.\n\u00a0 Annalena Baerbock is said to be tough, talented and very ambitious. Now, Germany's Green Party has named her as its candidate for chancellor.

The leaders identify unsustainable production and consumption as a key driver of environmental crises that \"require urgent and immediate global action.\" \u00a0 But strongmen leading some of the world's biggest polluters \u2014 US, China, India, Russia and Brazil \u2014 are not among the signatories.\u00a0 Missed targets The pledge follows the September publication of a landmark assessment of biodiversity which showed humanity had failed to fully achieve\u00a0any of the 20 global biodiversity targets set by the UN ten years ago. Just six of them had been \"partly achieved\", the report said. For one goal, on protecting coral reefs , the world was found to be\u00a0moving in the opposite direction. An oil spill in Mauritius in July is threatening coral reefs and other areas of rich biodiversity Indigenous people in Brazil blocked a highway in August that has enabled deforestation of the Amazon rainforest Data from individual governments shows\u00a0that a third of national biodiversity targets, which are set by the countries themselves, are on track to be met or exceeded. But these are less ambitious than the UN targets and less than a quarter match up well with the global goals to protect nature. The vision for biodiversity set out in 2010 is only achievable if the world responds to \"compelling evidence\" that \"transformative change\" is required, said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity, which prepared the Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO) report. The charge sheet is long. Pollution from plastics and pesticides have not been brought down to safe levels. Governments still subsidize businesses that damage ecosystems . Coral reefs, which are dying across the world, are struck by the triple-threat of human action: climate change, pollution and overfishing. Some of those drivers are getting worse. Fish populations are recovering in waters managed by sustainable fishing policies More than 3 billion people rely on fish for 20% of their daily protein intake And even where there is progress, it is rarely enough. Deforestation should have been halted by now, but\u00a0has only been cut by a third, with Asia and Europe gaining forests while Africa and South America lose them at a faster rate. Conservation efforts have saved species like the Puerto Rican amazon parrot and the Mongolian Przewalski's horse. But they have failed to keep others like the Western Black Rhino or the Christmas Island pipistrelle from being wiped out forever. While the big trends in biodiversity loss were already known, the UN report included \"systematic analysis\" on how well the world has achieved the 2010 targets, said Josef Settele, an ecologist at the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany, who contributed research to the report but was not involved in writing it.\u00a0 \"There is also some brightness,\" Settele added. \"The things we are doing are not completely in vain.\" For instance, almost 100 countries have incorporated biodiversity values into national accounting systems. Over the last 20 years, the world has increased the share of protected areas from 10% to 15% on land and from 3% to 7% in water. There are now more fish in waters managed by good fishing policies. Governments are increasingly eradicating invasive species from islands. And since 1993, conservation actions have prevented the extinction\u00a0of between 28 and 48 bird and mammal species, according to a study published this month in the journal Conservation Letters \u2014 though many remain highly threatened and may still become extinct. \"The progress toward conserving life on earth has been much greater than it would have been [without action],\" said Thomas Brooks, chief scientist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, who was a co-author of the Conservation Letters study but was not involved in the GBO. \"The absolutely key question is how to scale up from where things currently are, in terms of responses, to meet targets comprehensively.\" Bee populations are falling because of intensive farming, pesticides, pollution and climate change Damage to ecosystems puts food security at risk The way to get that scale, according to the GBO report, is by \"mainstreaming\" the opportunities and responsibilities from protecting nature. That means every level of society \u2014 from individuals and local communities to businesses and national governments \u2014 would need to factor biodiversity into their economic decisions. Like climate change, ecological collapse is happening at breakneck speed. A 2019 report by IPBES, the UN panel of biodiversity experts, found that humans are altering the natural world at an \"unprecedented pace\" and threatening 1 million animal and plant species with extinction. Scientists say both issues require systemic changes, but individual actions can help. Agriculture is one of the greatest drivers of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. A study published in the journal Nature this month found that more than two-thirds\u00a0of future biodiversity losses could be avoided by conserving and restoring land, reducing food waste and switching to more plant-based diets. They are among many actions laid out in the GBO report to reduce and eventually restore lost biodiversity. If we do not act faster, said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Program, \"biodiversity will continue to buckle\" under the weight of overexploitation, climate change, pollution, invasive alien species and changes to land and sea. \"This will further damage human health, economies and societies \u2014\u00a0with particularly detrimental effects on indigenous peoples and local communities.\" This is an updated version of an earlier article. Why do we find it so hard to change our behavior? German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk explains how this is connected to the climate crisis.\n\u00a0 A UN-backed report says a million species are at risk of extinction, and warns biodiversity loss and failure to conserve ecosystems has catastrophic effects on people as well as nature. \n\u00a0 While endangered species such as the spiny seahorse have started to recolonize former habitats due to coronavirus lockdowns, a new study confirms that the number of extinction-threatened species is rising fast. \n\u00a0 \n |\n Privacy Policy |\n Accessibility Statement |\n Legal notice |\n Contact \n| Mobile version \n", "headline": "Countries pledge to reverse destruction of nature after missing biodiversity targets", "article_name": "global-biodiversity-outlook-targets-extinction-summit-new-york-pledge", "article_url": "https://www.dw.com/en/global-biodiversity-outlook-targets-extinction-summit-new-york-pledge/a-54932895", "date_published": "2020-09-28 00:00:00", "article_length": 7175, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-26T08:24:42.072784"}

World leaders meet the Queen of England at the G7 conference in Cornwall Criticism from health and environment campaigners followed the release of the final G7 communique. \"This G7 summit will live on in infamy,\" said Max Lawson, the head of inequality policy at international aid group Oxfam. \"Faced with the biggest health emergency in a century and a climate catastrophe that is destroying our planet, they have completely failed to meet the challenges of our times.\" \u00a0 Campaigners also complained that the G7\u00a0failed to go into details about how it will pay for a newly agreed \"Nature Compact\" \u2014 aimed to protect 30% of the world's land and oceans from further destruction by 2030. Additionally, the 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses for poorer countries falls far short of the 11 billion doses the World Health Organization said is needed to vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population and truly end the pandemic. Former British prime minister Gordon Brown said the lack of a more ambitious vaccination plan was \"an unforgivable moral failure.\" International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach meanwhile thanked \"G7 leaders for their support\" for the Tokyo games that were postponed for a year \u00a0due to the coronavirus pandemic. \"We take this as a great encouragement to deliver safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 for everybody in this spirit of worldwide solidarity,\" Bach said. US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden visited the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, following the end of the three-day G7 summit. The Bidens emerged from a Land Rover on Sunday to meet the awaiting queen before inspecting the Guard of Honor assembled on the castle grounds. US President Joe Biden and US First Lady Jill Biden headed to Windsor Castle to meet the British monarch The queen and the US first lady stayed on a dais as Biden walked along the guard. Once Sunday's inspection was completed, the queen and the Bidens headed into the castle for tea. Following the visit, Biden said \"I don't think she'll be insulted, but she reminded me of my mother.\" US President Joe Biden inspected the Guard of Honor during a visit to Windsor Castle US President Joe Biden said his fellow leaders agreed that \"America is back at the table and fully engaged,\" following a period of \"America First\" protectionist policy under former president Donald Trump. Here's a roundup G7 leaders' comments on Biden at the summit. A \"big breath of fresh air\" is how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, host of the summit in southwest England, described Biden, He told reporters Sunday that the G7 stood united anew in its \"democratic values.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel, attending her last G7 in the post, meanwhile said Biden had brought \"new momentum\" to resolving the world's problems at the three-day summit. French President Macron and US counterpart Biden hit it off during the G7 summit French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that it was a relief that he was now working with an American president who he termed was \"willing to cooperate.\" \"What you demonstrate is leadership is partnership,\" Macron said of Biden. Macron and Biden appeared to have built up quick chemistry during the in-person summit. The two draped their arms around each other and chatted animatedly when they walked together after the leaders' photo on Friday. US President Joe Biden said democracies were \"in a contest with autocratic governments around the world\" in his final address at the G7 conference. \"We're in a contest, not with China per se, ... with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in a rapidly changing 21st century,\" said Biden. He indicated Russia had its own problems to \"chew on,\" saying its president, Vladimir Putin, had not changed. \"Let me make it clear I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which in many cases he has not,\" Biden told reporters. The US president also stressed that his country was making a comeback in international diplomacy, following Trump. \"America's back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values,'' Biden said, before leaving Cornwall to visit Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. \"I think we've made progress in reestablishing American credibility among our closest friends.\" Biden said he does not view NATO as a \"protection racket.\" Trump had often criticized European member states for what he viewed as too low financial contributions to the organization. Biden also reported that global leaders were gratified that he accepted the science of climate change: \"One of the things some of my colleagues said to me when I was there was, 'Well, the United States' leadership recognizes there is global warming,''' Biden said. The final communique from the G7 meeting has been released to some media outlets.\u00a0 The document covers several topics On the coronavirus, the document: On climate change\u00a0and environment it: Pledges\u00a0to meet\u00a0$100 billion a year overdue funding to help poorer countries tackle climate change On Russia, the document: On other human rights issues, it: On China, it: On global economic issues, it: G7 leaders said in their draft communique that China must respect human rights in Xinjiang as well as allow Hong Kong freedoms. The group also expressed concern over what it called Beijing's growing influence in the East and South China Seas, and in the Taiwan Strait. \"We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,\" the\u00a0G7\u00a0said in the\u00a0communique that was almost finalized. Leaders also expressed concern over forced labor in China.\u00a0 \"The United States and our G7 partners remain deeply concerned by the use of all forms of forced labor in global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor of vulnerable groups and minorities and supply chains of the agricultural, solar, and garment sectors \u2014 the main supply chains of concern in Xinjiang,\" the document said. DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says G7\u00a0leaders have agreed to increase their financial support \"to make sure that they will be able to mobilize \u20ac100 billion for poorer nations to cope with the coincidences of climate change and to help them switch to clean energy.\"\u00a0 \"However, this promise was already made a decade ago and so far the leaders have not managed to live up to their promises,\" von Nahmen told DW.\u00a0Therefore, they are \"now saying they are definitely going to increase financial spending,\" she added. G7 leaders called for a\u00a0transparent, science-based study into the origins of COVID-19 convened by the World Health Organization, according to the draft communique.\u00a0 \"We\u00a0call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 COVID-19 Origins study including, as recommended by the experts\u2019 report, in\u00a0China,\" it said.\u00a0 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hopes that a new G7 task force can present details of the first infrastructure projects in developing countries in 2022. She also said that 2.3 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses should be distributed to low-income countries by\u00a0the end of next year. \"Germany is responsible for 350 million doses,\"\u00a0Merkel\u00a0said.\u00a0That includes 30 million doses that Germany had ordered and would distribute, she said. \"That will probably be more over time.\"\u00a0 The\u00a0G7\u00a0group has \"agreed that the pandemic can only be defeated globally,\" she said. \"The way out of the pandemic is vaccines,\" she stressed.\u00a0 Speaking about coal, for which the G7 leaders\u00a0are facing pressure to phase out state subsidies, Merkel said\u00a0the delegates had not\u00a0agreed on a date for ending the use of\u00a0the fossil fuel. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has joined the summit for its last day, urged the G7\u00a0to help finance the World Health Organization's\u00a0program\u00a0to increase COVID-19 testing, diagnostics and vaccines. \"We need to address the substantial financing gap for tests, treatments, critical supplies like oxygen and the health systems that enable testing, treatment and vaccination,\" Ramaphosa said in the presidency statement, referring to the\u00a0Access to the COVID-19 Tools Accelerator.\u00a0 \"If all\u00a0G7\u00a0countries met their fair share target, this initiative\u00a0would be two-thirds funded \u2013 and it would be 90% funded if all G20 countries made their fair share contributions,\" Ramaphosa said. G7 countries will provide one\u00a0billion COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next year and work with the private sector\u00a0and other countries to increase the contribution over the next months, according to a communique draft. \"The commitments since we last met in February 2021 including here in Carbis Bay provide for one\u00a0billion doses over the next year,\" the communique said. \"We will work together with the private sector, the G20 and other countries to increase this contribution over the months to come,\" it added. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lauded the vaccine pledge but said it's not enough. He said at least 11 billion doses are needed to\u00a0 vaccinate at least 70% of the world's population \u00a0by the middle of next year. \"We need more and we need them faster,'' Tedros said. DW correspondent Alexandra von Nahmen says climate policy is a \"top priority\" for G7 countries. Speaking from Cornwall, England, where the G7 summit is taking place, von Nahmen\u00a0says leaders are expected to discuss the phasing out of diesel and patrol cars as well as ending the use of coal \"as soon as possible.\" She\u00a0added that the leaders are unlikely to specify a deadline. \u00a0 Concerning\u00a0relations between the West and China, von Nahmen said:\u00a0\"The US is pushing and hoping for a united front to counter China's rise,\" with European countries being \"very cautious not to push it too far to the extent that it would prevent any cooperation with China.\" \"What we expect from the (final) communique is to strike a balance, to stress that it is important to work on global issues with Beijing such as climate change,\" she said,\u00a0adding that the G7 would also be expected to \"call out China for human rights abuses\" and that the Chinese government should \"use fair methods to compete with western economies.\" Oxfam activists get creative at a climate protest at Swanpool Beach near Falmouth during the G7 summit The heads of state\u00a0plan to commit to steps to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources. The US, Germany, Britain and Canada say they intend to provide developing countries with up to $2 billion (\u20ac1.65 billion) to accelerate their phase-out of\u00a0coal. A White House statement also said that the\u00a0G7\u00a0would coordinate climate targets so that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as outlined in the Paris climate agreement\u00a0\u2014\u00a0remains \"within reach.\" British naturalist Sir David Attenborough is to\u00a0address\u00a0the G7 delegates by video link, warning that countries must take urgent action to avoid human-made environmental disasters. In remarks released ahead of his speech, Attenborough said global warming and loss of biodiversity are \"beyond doubt,\" as is the fact that \"our societies and nations are unequal.\" \"The question science forces us to address specifically in 2021 is whether, as a result of these intertwined facts, we are on the verge of destabilizing the entire planet.\" \"If that is so, then the decisions we make this decade, in particular the decisions made by the most economically advanced nations, are the most important in human history,\" Attenborough added. The third and final day of the G7 summit takes\u00a0place in Cornwall, England, on Sunday. The UK wants to use the summit to coordinate global climate targets and persuade world leaders to agree on tougher climate measures, such as the phasing out of coal. The heads of state and government\u00a0will discuss steps on how to limit state subsidies for fossil energy sources as well as how to\u00a0accelerate the phase-out of\u00a0coal. mvb/mm (AP, Reuters, dpa) The US leads efforts to create a western alternative to China's New Silk Road project, but the EU is wary of setting up an anti-China coalition.

{"id": null, "body": "     Climate change is happening more rapidly than anyone though possible, the German government's expert, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, warned in an interview. The earth is heating up faster than many realize The threats posed by climate change are worse than those imagined by most governments, warned Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the scientist who heads the Potsdam Institute for Research on Global Warming Effects and acts as an adviser to German Chancellor Angela Merkel on climate-change issues. Schellnhuber warns that previous predictions about climate change and its catastrophic effects were too cautious and optimistic. \"In nearly all areas, the developments are occurring more quickly than it has been assumed up until now,\" Schellnhuber told the Saarbruecker Zeitung newspaper in an interview published Monday, Dec. 29. \"We are on our way to a destabilization of the world climate that has advanced much further than most people or their governments realize.\" Melting ice, rising water levels Ice in Greenland is melting fast The Arctic sea ice is melting more quickly than expected. There are also signs that the entire climate pattern at the North Poll has been disrupted to the extent of causing irreversible change. For the Arctic, the global warming which has already occurred of 0.8 degrees Celsius has already stepped over the line, Schellnhuber said. If Greenland's ice cap ice melts completely, water levels will rise by seven meters (23 feet). \"The current coastline will no longer exist, and that includes in Germany,\" he said. All countries need to sign on Will Europe's shift towards renewable energy be fast enough? In order to stop global warming, global CO2 emissions would need to be halved by 2050. For industrial countries, that would mean a decrease of 80 to 90 percent. By 2020, this process has to be well underway. \"When only one side fails to act, industrial countries or developing countries, than a disastrous climate change will be inevitable,\" he said.

{"id": null, "body": "     Australia, a major coal exporter and one of the worst per capita emitters, goes to the polls Saturday. The result could be decisive for global climate goals, as voters demand lawmakers do more to cut emissions. Australians are already dealing with hellish wildfires, worsened by climate change The results of the Australian election this Saturday will set the climate agenda for one of the planet's worst per-capita CO2 emitters. It comes\u00a0as the world faces a rapidly closing window to stop the most severe impacts\u00a0of climate change. The country, dubbed a \"wrecker\" at climate change negotiations,\u00a0is a major exporter of fossil fuels, largely to East Asia and India. It\u00a0has been criticized\u00a0for grossly insufficient climate targets by the UK and US as well as its neighboring Pacific nations who could see their homes disappear as sea levels rise. Australians want action on climate change, but major parties have hardly mentioned the issue in their election campaigns At the same time, polls clearly show voters back stronger climate action in the \"sunburned land,\" having already experienced deadly and costly flooding and wildfires linked to climate change in recent years. Some big businesses, once against emissions cuts,\u00a0have also done a U-turn on climate policy. The country is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. \"Australians are feeling and seeing climate damage now and that's why most Australians are very worried about climate change and want the government to do a lot more than they are,\" said Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF). Despite public support, the major parties vying for votes in the tight election have barely mentioned the issue in their campaigns, said Peter Christoff, senior research fellow with Melbourne Climate Futures, which is part of the University of Melbourne. \"And that's really quite concerning and worrying,\" said Christoff. Wildfires in 2021: Australians are already feeling the effects of the climate crisis Since 2007, Australia's two major parties, the center-left Labor Party and the conservative Liberal Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison, have been in an open war over climate change policies, leading to multiple leaders being toppled. \"The public vitriol in political exchanges \u2014 particularly over an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon and carbon taxes \u2014 led to some of the ugliest politics we've seen in Australia over a 15-year period,\" said Christoff. Labor believes it lost the supposedly unlosable \"climate election\" in 2019 to the Liberals because of a backlash against its strong climate policies and job fears in key seats in coal-mining areas. Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter. And because of\u00a0the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising coal prices mean Australia will likely earn 100 billion Australian dollars (\u20ac67\u00a0billion, $70\u00a0billion) in one year from coal. Meanwhile, between 100,000 and 300,000 Australian jobs connected to coal, oil and gas are at risk if the country doesn't prepare for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to a study by independent Australian think tank, the Centre for Policy Development. To date, the conservatives\u00a0have stymied significant action on climate change \u2014 blocking a major emissions trading scheme,\u00a0 slashing funding on climate research, \u00a0subsidizing and allowing fossil fuel production to expand and abolishing the government-funded Climate Commission. At the 2021\u00a0UN climate conference in Glasgow, the government refused to budge from its 2030 emission cuts of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels \u2014\u00a0one of the weakest targets in the developed world. The UN Climate Action Tracker rates Australia's emissions and net-zero targets as \"poor\" and \"highly insufficient,\" putting it on a path to\u00a0more than 3 degrees Celsius warming. Going into the 2022 election, the Liberal Party\u00a0 pledged to go net-zero by 2050 , but has given itself scope to ignore this . At the same time, it has vowed to continue exports of Australia's coal and gas past 2050 and has included these fossil fuels in its domestic energy blueprint. Labor \u2014 currently forecast to win this election \u2014 has also vowed to go net-zero by 2050 and has stronger emission cuts of 43% by 2030 . It has\u00a0pledged tens of billions of dollars to revitalize the nation's energy grid and install solar banks and batteries. But it\u00a0says it won't stop exporting coal and gas. The Australian Green Party, as well as climate-minded independents, are seeing a surge in support Australia is dominated by two main parties, but by dragging their heels on climate change Labor and the Liberals have opened the door to new challengers. A group of independents, dubbed \"the teals,\" are competing with Liberal lawmakers\u00a0for urban seats. Mostly women, they\u00a0receive funding from a group called Climate 200 \u2014 a relatively new political fund\u00a0established by clean energy investor Simon Holmes a Court \u2014 and have campaigned on climate, integrity, and gender equality. They have all set ambitious 2030 emission reduction targets ranging from 50% to 70% by 2030. And they appear to be attracting moderate Liberal voters who have become disillusioned with a lack of movement on climate change. Most recent polling shows several key seats are at risk. Meanwhile, the Greens\u00a0have enjoyed a surge and are now polling at about 15% nationally \u2014 compared to 10% in the 2019 election. They have pledged to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 , go net-zero by 2035, phase out the mining, burning and exporting of coal by 2030 and convert the grid to 100% renewables. Depending on the result of the election, both the Greens and the teal candidates could wield significant power over the government. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg may lose his seat to a climate-friendly independent Businesses are also calling for more action. In one\u00a0example, Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes is attempting to use his wealth to force energy giant AGL to exit coal-fired power generation. Even the Business Council of Australia \u2014\u00a0which represents big\u00a0banks and corporations, such as industrial and retail giant Wesfarmers, mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto and airline Qantas\u00a0\u2014 is now also calling for major emission cuts by 2030. It's a dramatic shift for the organization that in 2018 called 45% emissions reduction cuts \"an economy wrecking target.\" \"It's certainly not the community that is holding back the Australian political parties on climate action and also not the business community,\" ACF's O'Shanassy said. \"Everyone wants climate action except for the people that go to Parliament House.\" But neither Labor nor the Liberals' targets are enough to bring Australia in line with its Paris Commitments. Emissions cuts of at least 50% by 2030 are what's required to keep it below the upper threshold of 2 degrees warming and about 75% for the 1.5-degree target, according to some estimates. ACF believes\u00a0 the next government should\u00a0take advantage of the country's\u00a0huge solar and wind potential and could quickly cut\u00a0emissions while preserving jobs by replacing fossil fuel\u00a0exports with products created with renewable energy such as hydrogen and ammonia. \"We need to use the vast amount of renewable energy we have in this country. We need to times it by about ten and then turn that into exports and stop exporting pollution to the world,\" O'Shanassy said. \"That would be our greatest contribution to climate change.\" Many countries around the world banned the usual New Year's fireworks to relieve pressure on hospitals swamped with COVID-19 cases. For Germany, that meant an estimated 3,500 tons of plastic waste saved. In Amsterdam, the taboo on home pyrotechnics looks set to endure, with the city organizing public displays instead. Europe and North America saw plunging temperatures, with many regions blanketed in deep snow. Arctic warming caused dips in the polar vortex and a weaker jet stream, conspiring to send chilly Arctic air south. Disruption of the jet stream can also have the reverse effect, sending warm air up from the tropics. We're yet to see which trend will dominate as the planet continues to heat up. Thousands of people had to leave their homes after heavy rain flooded towns in eastern Australia. Gladys Berejiklian, then the premier of New South Wales, a state that was particularly affected, called the inundation a \"one-in-100-year event.\" Some commentators argued that this kind of flooding is in fact becoming the new normal. Europe's biggest economy was given a reality check by its Constitutional Court, which declared the German Climate Protection Act unconstitutional for failing to include climate targets beyond 2030. The court said this would place too great a burden on future generations. The Bundestag toughened up the legislation with a commitment to go climate-neutral by 2045. In another landmark ruling, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered Shell to cut its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. It was the first time a private company has been legally forced to comply with the global agreement. \"This applies to the entire world, so also to Shell,\" the judge said. More than 230 people died during a heat wave in Canada, with record temperatures of nearly 50 degrees Celsius (122 F) recorded in Lytton, British Columbia. The following day, forest fires reduced much of the village to ash. This was also a summer of devastating blazes for California, Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Turkey, and Siberia and the Amazon. In Central Europe, catastrophic heavy rain turned streams into raging rivers that inundated towns and villages as they burst their banks. In Germany's Rhineland, more than 180 people lost their lives. Parts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also suffered extreme floods. Property damage in Germany alone was estimated at several billion euros. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report with an unequivocal message: The climate crisis is worse than we thought and humans are definitely to blame. The IPCC's assessment reports are the most detailed and comprehensive on the topic, in this case drawing on more than 14,000 peer-reviewed studies. At the UN General Assembly, Premier Xi Jinping announced that China would no longer build coal-fired power plants abroad \u2014 putting an end to a construction spree that has already seen hundreds of Chinese-backed coal power projects go up as part of its Belt and Road Initiative through Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. But Beijing continues to build new coal power plants at home. Concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere reached a new record in 2020. According to the report by the World Meteorological Organization, the year-on-year increase was higher than the average increase over the past decade, despite the economic fallout of the pandemic. The WMO announced the figures with the warning that \"we are way off track\" for the Paris Agreement targets. After a pandemic hiatus, the UN Climate Change Conference was back in 2021, but it struggled to decide the details of the Glasgow Climate Pact. With India and China resisting a commitment to phase out coal, the final text agreed only to a \"phasedown.\" For many, this was hugely disappointing, though not necessarily surprising. Greta Thunberg had already declared COP26 \"a global greenwash festival.\" With the year drawing to a close, the US was hit by more extreme weather as 36 tornadoes swept through six states and left devastation in their wake. Homes and businesses were demolished, while dozens of people were killed. President Biden announced an investigation into global heating's impact on the tornadoes. Soonafter, nearly 400 people died in the Philippines after Typhoon Rai hit.

{"id": null, "body": "     Australia, a major coal exporter and one of the worst per capita emitters, goes to the polls Saturday. The result could be decisive for global climate goals, as voters demand lawmakers do more to cut emissions. Australians are already dealing with hellish wildfires, worsened by climate change The results of the Australian election this Saturday will set the climate agenda for one of the planet's worst per-capita CO2 emitters. It comes\u00a0as the world faces a rapidly closing window to stop the most severe impacts\u00a0of climate change. The country, dubbed a \"wrecker\" at climate change negotiations,\u00a0is a major exporter of fossil fuels, largely to East Asia and India. It\u00a0has been criticized\u00a0for grossly insufficient climate targets by the UK and US as well as its neighboring Pacific nations who could see their homes disappear as sea levels rise. Australians want action on climate change, but major parties have hardly mentioned the issue in their election campaigns At the same time, polls clearly show voters back stronger climate action in the \"sunburned land,\" having already experienced deadly and costly flooding and wildfires linked to climate change in recent years. Some big businesses, once against emissions cuts,\u00a0have also done a U-turn on climate policy. The country is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. \"Australians are feeling and seeing climate damage now and that's why most Australians are very worried about climate change and want the government to do a lot more than they are,\" said Kelly O'Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF). Despite public support, the major parties vying for votes in the tight election have barely mentioned the issue in their campaigns, said Peter Christoff, senior research fellow with Melbourne Climate Futures, which is part of the University of Melbourne. \"And that's really quite concerning and worrying,\" said Christoff. Wildfires in 2021: Australians are already feeling the effects of the climate crisis Since 2007, Australia's two major parties, the center-left Labor Party and the conservative Liberal Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison, have been in an open war over climate change policies, leading to multiple leaders being toppled. \"The public vitriol in political exchanges \u2014 particularly over an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon and carbon taxes \u2014 led to some of the ugliest politics we've seen in Australia over a 15-year period,\" said Christoff. Labor believes it lost the supposedly unlosable \"climate election\" in 2019 to the Liberals because of a backlash against its strong climate policies and job fears in key seats in coal-mining areas. Australia is the world's second biggest coal exporter. And because of\u00a0the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising coal prices mean Australia will likely earn 100 billion Australian dollars (\u20ac67\u00a0billion, $70\u00a0billion) in one year from coal. Meanwhile, between 100,000 and 300,000 Australian jobs connected to coal, oil and gas are at risk if the country doesn't prepare for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to a study by independent Australian think tank, the Centre for Policy Development. To date, the conservatives\u00a0have stymied significant action on climate change \u2014 blocking a major emissions trading scheme,\u00a0 slashing funding on climate research, \u00a0subsidizing and allowing fossil fuel production to expand and abolishing the government-funded Climate Commission. At the 2021\u00a0UN climate conference in Glasgow, the government refused to budge from its 2030 emission cuts of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels \u2014\u00a0one of the weakest targets in the developed world. The UN Climate Action Tracker rates Australia's emissions and net-zero targets as \"poor\" and \"highly insufficient,\" putting it on a path to\u00a0more than 3 degrees Celsius warming. Going into the 2022 election, the Liberal Party\u00a0 pledged to go net-zero by 2050 , but has given itself scope to ignore this . At the same time, it has vowed to continue exports of Australia's coal and gas past 2050 and has included these fossil fuels in its domestic energy blueprint. Labor \u2014 currently forecast to win this election \u2014 has also vowed to go net-zero by 2050 and has stronger emission cuts of 43% by 2030 . It has\u00a0pledged tens of billions of dollars to revitalize the nation's energy grid and install solar banks and batteries. But it\u00a0says it won't stop exporting coal and gas. The Australian Green Party, as well as climate-minded independents, are seeing a surge in support Australia is dominated by two main parties, but by dragging their heels on climate change Labor and the Liberals have opened the door to new challengers. A group of independents, dubbed \"the teals,\" are competing with Liberal lawmakers\u00a0for urban seats. Mostly women, they\u00a0receive funding from a group called Climate 200 \u2014 a relatively new political fund\u00a0established by clean energy investor Simon Holmes a Court \u2014 and have campaigned on climate, integrity, and gender equality. They have all set ambitious 2030 emission reduction targets ranging from 50% to 70% by 2030. And they appear to be attracting moderate Liberal voters who have become disillusioned with a lack of movement on climate change. Most recent polling shows several key seats are at risk. Meanwhile, the Greens\u00a0have enjoyed a surge and are now polling at about 15% nationally \u2014 compared to 10% in the 2019 election. They have pledged to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 , go net-zero by 2035, phase out the mining, burning and exporting of coal by 2030 and convert the grid to 100% renewables. Depending on the result of the election, both the Greens and the teal candidates could wield significant power over the government. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg may lose his seat to a climate-friendly independent Businesses are also calling for more action. In one\u00a0example, Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes is attempting to use his wealth to force energy giant AGL to exit coal-fired power generation. Even the Business Council of Australia \u2014\u00a0which represents big\u00a0banks and corporations, such as industrial and retail giant Wesfarmers, mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto and airline Qantas\u00a0\u2014 is now also calling for major emission cuts by 2030. It's a dramatic shift for the organization that in 2018 called 45% emissions reduction cuts \"an economy wrecking target.\" \"It's certainly not the community that is holding back the Australian political parties on climate action and also not the business community,\" ACF's O'Shanassy said. \"Everyone wants climate action except for the people that go to Parliament House.\" But neither Labor nor the Liberals' targets are enough to bring Australia in line with its Paris Commitments. Emissions cuts of at least 50% by 2030 are what's required to keep it below the upper threshold of 2 degrees warming and about 75% for the 1.5-degree target, according to some estimates. ACF believes\u00a0 the next government should\u00a0take advantage of the country's\u00a0huge solar and wind potential and could quickly cut\u00a0emissions while preserving jobs by replacing fossil fuel\u00a0exports with products created with renewable energy such as hydrogen and ammonia. \"We need to use the vast amount of renewable energy we have in this country. We need to times it by about ten and then turn that into exports and stop exporting pollution to the world,\" O'Shanassy said. \"That would be our greatest contribution to climate change.\" Many countries around the world banned the usual New Year's fireworks to relieve pressure on hospitals swamped with COVID-19 cases. For Germany, that meant an estimated 3,500 tons of plastic waste saved. In Amsterdam, the taboo on home pyrotechnics looks set to endure, with the city organizing public displays instead. Europe and North America saw plunging temperatures, with many regions blanketed in deep snow. Arctic warming caused dips in the polar vortex and a weaker jet stream, conspiring to send chilly Arctic air south. Disruption of the jet stream can also have the reverse effect, sending warm air up from the tropics. We're yet to see which trend will dominate as the planet continues to heat up. Thousands of people had to leave their homes after heavy rain flooded towns in eastern Australia. Gladys Berejiklian, then the premier of New South Wales, a state that was particularly affected, called the inundation a \"one-in-100-year event.\" Some commentators argued that this kind of flooding is in fact becoming the new normal. Europe's biggest economy was given a reality check by its Constitutional Court, which declared the German Climate Protection Act unconstitutional for failing to include climate targets beyond 2030. The court said this would place too great a burden on future generations. The Bundestag toughened up the legislation with a commitment to go climate-neutral by 2045. In another landmark ruling, a district court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered Shell to cut its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

{"id": null, "body": "     German farmers are no strangers to the elements, but this summer has brought home the realities of climate change, and the need to start adapting. How can farmers adapt to the changing conditions? Carved into a block of wood and given pride of place in the parlor of an old farmhouse 100 or so kilometers (around 62 miles) northwest of Berlin, is a quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe : Was du ererbt von deinen V\u00e4tern hast, erwirb es, um es zu besitzen . From his place at the head of a solid wooden table, farmer Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen recites the words that were also a feature of his western German childhood home.\u00a0 Loosely translated, they mean: To own your inheritance,\u00a0you have to use it well. He interprets them as a reminder of his \"duty\" to tend the land in his custody with such care, that when it passes to his children, it is in better condition than when he took it on. Read more:  Germany swelters under heat wave As a young man, Gr\u00fcnhagen left Lower Saxony and the family farm that dates back to the year 936 and has been running his own place in Germany's former East for almost three decades. During that time, he has seen changes, not only to his farm and the lively village where it's located, but to the country's political, societal and, increasingly, climate landscape . \"I'm not talking about the extremes, because we've always had them,\" he told DW, \"but about the growing period, which now starts earlier in the spring, even when we have a late winter like this one, when it was still very cold in January and February.\" Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen comes from a long line of farmers. He says the changing climate is having an impact on his crops Fatal frosts and punishing heat His is an arable farm of 1,300 hectares (3,212 acres) \u2014 part conventional, part organic \u2014 that grows 19 crop varieties including grains, peas, hemp, Jerusalem artichokes and corn. One of his signature plants is the humble potato, which has struggled to survive in this summer of no rain and temperatures edging towards 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). \"Potatoes don't like temperatures above 25 degrees, they stop growing properly,\" he said, adding that he invested in an irrigation system a few years ago. \"It doesn't stop the heat, but at least it keeps the plants alive.\" Where possible, he has begun to switch to varieties that lend themselves to warmer weather. But even that hasn't worked this year. \"We planted corn, but it was so dry that it didn't even germinate. The field is empty.\" For those crops that do germinate, there is still the very real threat of late spring frosts heavy enough to wipe out young plants that have been seduced into premature existence by unnaturally warm daytime temperatures. \"Grains start to grow earlier than they used to, the ear might already be in the stalk when there's a night frost,\" he said. \"That means the ear dies and you're left with nothing.\" Gr\u00fcnhagen's main crop is the potato. The edible tuber doesn't do well in high temperatures From the grain to the grape Hundreds of kilometers south-west, in the wine growing region of Rhein-Hesse, vigneron Adolf Dahlem is looking for ways to overcome similar challenges that he says are \"undeniably\" linked to climate change . \"The first really bad year was 2003. Nothing but sun for months on end,\" he told DW. \"We've had several early and warm years since then, and the gaps between them are getting shorter and shorter.\" Though unremitting sunshine might sound like a wine grower's dream, it's more complex than that. Apart from the same problems of plants that produce shoots before the fatal frost season is over, vignerons in the region are grappling with new strains of pests and ever earlier harvests. Read more:  Climate change and farming: 'Unpredictability is here to stay' When Dahlem was a child, the grapes were picked in October. But in recent years, the annual event has moved into September and even August. \"This early harvest goes hand-in-hand with high temperatures,\" he said. And therein lies the problem. \"If we're harvesting when it's around 30 C, the grapes and the must will also have a temperature of 30 degrees.\" Though Dahlem tries to harvest at night and in the early morning when the fruit is cooler, it takes \"a highly technological and energy-intensive process\" to keep the grapes at the right temperature to achieve \"the unique harmony of fruit and acidity\" for which the region's riesling is famed. Wine growers are dealing with vines that produce shoots earlier, leaving them vulnerable to frosts Some growers see an opportunity to experiment with different grape sorts to make red wines atypical for the region, but Dahlem says there's a real desire in the community to find ways to keep on producing top-quality riesling. \"We will try to adapt,\" he said. \"But it is really very hard to meet the market's expectations.\" From the ground up And that is becoming a common refrain. Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen anticipates a 50 percent drop in yield this year. \"It has consequences for the agricultural industry, for those who buy our grain or the starch factory that processes our potatoes.\" All he can do, he says, is to try and adapt to the changing conditions, to be selective in the crops he sows, to irrigate where possible, and to ensure his soil is as healthy as it can be. For the chairman of the German Federation of the Organic Food Industry (B\u00d6LW), Felix zu L\u00f6wenstein, the state of Germany's farming land is a pressing issue.\u00a0 He believes the country's agricultural system has been due a complete rethink for some time, but that climate change brings the need for a \"radical\" overhaul into even sharper relief.\u00a0 Citing the increasing incidence of extreme weather events such as drought and heavy rainfall, he says it's untenable to \"pretend that everything has to stay as it was, and from time to time ask for some public money to keep us alive.\" Read more:  Heat wave challenges German wine industry as it eyes changing trends He sees soil fertility, increased humus content and reduced soil compaction \u2014 both of which make it easier for the ground to absorb and store water \u2014 increased biodiversity and crop rotation as potential measures for long-term change. Many farmers have hit back at him for vocalizing these thoughts at a time when the relentless heat of the past months has filled many with an existential angst. \"They take it as a reproach,\" he said, \"and it makes me sad because that's the last thing I want to do.\" Rethinking European farming What he does want though, is to use the extremity of this summer as a catalyst for an earnest discussion about the future. He sees EU plans to rework its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) by 2020 as an opportunity to stop paying subsidies on the current per hectare basis under which large farms stand to benefit the most. \"We have to switch to a policy where farmers are paid for a service they're providing,\" he said. \"For measures that increase biodiversity, that make farming and food production more resilient.\" Experts say Germany and Europe's agricultural system needs a radical overhaul to deal with the impact of climate change Read more:  Opinion: The German farmers who moan until the cows come home Gr\u00fcnhagen, however, fears that a loss of the current subsidy system would lead to fallow land. \"In this region, we have light soil which means the earning potential is relatively low,\" he said, adding that the subsidies are a lifeline for many farmers. Without them, he predicts summers where \"large swathes of brown land\" stretch across the country because farmers would simply give up. He hopes it won't come to that, and for his part, vows to continue adapting and tending his land in keeping with his interpretation of Goethe's words, and with enough care to ensure there is something to pass onto the next generation. Even in the face of climate change. Hans-Heinrich Gr\u00fcnhagen has an arable farm a 90-minute drive north of Berlin. He says he has noticed climate change in the extended growing period of his crops. While even a few years ago, he had to harvest his potatoes by early October, he says that has changed, because the frosts no longer arrive as early in the year. Gr\u00fcnhagen expects to get at least this number of potatoes from each plant, but because they wither in temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit), keeping them healthy is not easy. The only option he has is to water them. Even so, this summer of extreme heat means he's looking at half his usual yield. He grows many different kinds of grain and says nothing about their harvest time has changed. Still, they sprout and grow earlier, making them more vulnerable to late frosts, which have not been eradicated by climate change. Where possible, he is now switching to crop varieties that can cope with more sun. Vintners are facing similar problems. In western Germany, warmer daytime temperatures in North Rhine-Westphalia's (NRW) wine-growing region coax vines into producing buds earlier than they used to. As with other plants, that makes them vulnerable on nights when the temperature falls below zero degrees Celsius. As they're particularly sensitive, once they've been bitten, they tend to die. Long summers of extreme heat also make the grapes ripen much earlier, meaning they have to be harvested earlier. The higher temperatures affect their taste. But keeping them cool enough during the wine-making process requires a huge technological effort. When possible, vintners try to pick the grapes in the middle of the night or in the early morning before they've absorbed the warmth of the day. Some in the NRW wine-making community see the changing weather patterns as an opportunity to experiment with growing grape sorts that previously couldn't have weathered the German climate. But they don't want to lose their long-standing reputation for producing the white wines for which the region has become globally well-known. There are calls from within Germany's farming community to rethink the country's entire food production system and to put more emphasis on improving the quality of the ground on which the nation relies. Measures such as planting more trees and bushes to stop drying winds, and preventing excessive soil compaction through the use of heavy machines could help. Healthy soil, says Felix zu L\u00f6wenstein, Chairman of the German Federation of the Organic Food Industry, has much to do with how much humus and how much life exists within it. The higher the content, the greater the soil's ability to absorb water, making it more resilient both in times of drought and extreme rainfall. Author: Tamsin Walker Earth's population is soaring, demand for more resource-intensive foods shows no sign of abating and climate change threatens to make farming in many regions even tougher. Growing plants without soil could be a solution.
