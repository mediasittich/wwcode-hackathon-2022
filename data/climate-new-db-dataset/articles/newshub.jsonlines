While climate campaigners and nations pushing for bigger steps to be taken to fight climate change  came away underwhelmed , a growing number of private investors are putting their money where their mouths are.\u00a0 The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ),  set up in April , brings together asset managers and financial institutions pledging to only invest in businesses that are already at, or have plans to be net zero when it comes to carbon emissions by 2050. \"What that means is they'll direct more funding towards green companies, or those companies that are helping decarbonise; and less to those companies that will stay being high polluters,\" Milford Asset Management portfolio manager Frances Sweetman told The AM Show on Thursday.\u00a0 During the Glasgow COP26 talks, GFANZ said it now represented managers with US$140 trillion in assets - more than the entire global GDP. In the short-term they're expected to deliver \"their fair share of 50 percent emission reductions this decade\", and report their progress annually.\u00a0 \"The architecture of the global financial system has been transformed to deliver net zero,\"  said UN special envoy for climate action and finance Mark Carney , who also advises UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on finance issues.\u00a0 \"We now have the essential plumbing in place to move climate change from the fringes to the forefront of finance so that every financial decision takes climate change into account. Only this mainstream focus can finance the estimated $100 trillion of investment needed over the next three decades for a clean energy future.\" Sweetman said companies who don't decarbonise might struggle to raise investment in the future. \"That has quite a serious implication for the share market and particularly those companies that are high polluters and are not dedicated to reducing their carbon emissions.\" Kiwi investors should also avoid putting all their money into coal, Sweetman warned. One of the agreements reached in Glasgow was to phase out coal use by the 2030s, a \"reasonably ambitious\" target.\u00a0 \"We have one coal-fired power station, and its owner Genesis Energy has already sort of indicated it wants to phase out in that time scale.\u00a0 \"The more important implication is the other coal-fired boilers and manufacturing processes that we have around New Zealand - which we've got a lot. In order to transfer those to either be powered by renewable electricity or by biomass will take a lot of investment, particularity in the electricity grid. That part's really important - who's going to invest in that grid upgrade, and when and how?\" Another agreement New Zealand signed up to was a global effort to cut methane emissions by 30 percent. Luckily for our heavy methane emitting industries, not every country has to do the full 30 percent. \"Not every country has to reduce by 30 percent - some can reduce more, some can reduce less. Our Zero Carbon Act has us reducing methane by 10 percent - is that enough, or do we need to do more?

If we stopped emissions right now, it will take a bit longer for warming to resume, but their calculations suggest it's inevitable.\u00a0 \"All man-made emissions would have had to be cut to zero sometime between 1960 and 1970 - when global warming was still below 0.5C,\"  they wrote in journal  Scientific Reports .\u00a0 Greenpeace NZ executive director and former Green Party co-leader Russel Norman disagreed, telling The AM Show it's not too late to save the planet from runaway climate change.\u00a0 \"It's using a much simpler climate model than the usual climate models used by the big international reports - like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. When you look at the big climate models... they say there is still time to avoid out-of-control climate change.\" Kiwi scientists appear to agree with Dr Norman. \"Earth system models typically contain hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and require a supercomputer to run on.

But even supposedly clean-and-green New Zealand is nowhere near meeting its present, weaker targets. \"It gives you a sense of the scale of the challenge. We have to rapidly decarbonise transport, we have to really cut emissions out of agriculture. They're huge challenges - they're doable, but we really do need to get on with it...

Existential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach , published by Australian thinktank  Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration , suggests climate warnings from the likes of the UN are downplaying the sheer chaos that could erupt by 2050 as the world warms. If emissions don't start to fall until 2030 - behind the goal set by the 2015 Paris Agreement - the authors say the world could warm 3C by 2050 \"due to the activation of a number of carbon-cycle feedbacks\". This could result in sea levels rising 0.5m by 2050, 3m by 2100 as ice sheets and permafrost melt, and up to 25m in the longer-term. \"Thirty-five percent of the global land area, and 55 percent of the global population, are subject to more than 20 days a year of lethal heat conditions, beyond the threshold of human survivability,\" by 2050, the report says. \"North America suffers from devastating weather extremes including wildfires, heatwaves, drought and inundation,\" as the Gulf stream weather system weakens. \"The summer monsoons in China have failed, and water flows into the great rivers of Asia are severely reduced by the loss of more than one-third of the Himalayan ice sheet... Aridification emerges over more than 30 percent of the world's land surface. Desertification is severe in southern Africa, the southern Mediterranean, west Asia, the Middle East, inland Australia and across the south-western United States.\" Ecosystems in the Amazon, Arctic and coral reefs collapse and crop yields drop as food-growing regions become too hot to live in. \"Armed conflict between nations over resources, such as the Nile and its tributaries, is likely and nuclear war is possible.\" At 25m of sea level rise, much of Auckland's west and south would be underwater, according to  floodmap.net . The report was penned by climate change researcher David Spratt and Ian Dunlop, who used to be chairman of the Australian Coal Association and a fossil fuel industry executive. They're calling on the world to adopt a \"wartime level of response\" to climate change. \"To reduce such risks and to sustain human civilisation, it is essential to build a zero-emissions industrial system very quickly.\" Failure to do so could mean the end of civilisation as we know it. \"Even for 2C of warming, more than a billion people may need to be relocated and in high-end scenarios, the scale of destruction is beyond our capacity to model, with a high likelihood of human civilisation coming to an end,\" the report states. \"Human life on earth may be on the way to extinction, in the most horrible way,\" retired Australian Navy Admiral Chris Barrie added in a foreword to the report. \"A doomsday future is not inevitable! But without immediate drastic action, our prospects are poor.\" New Zealand's greenhouse emissions have  increased 23 percent since 1990 , data released in April shows. \"The world now has just a decade to cut carbon emissions in half to avoid climate catastrophe,\" Greenpeace executive director Russel Norman said at the time.

New Zealand has also had an  extreme summer of weather , with record-breaking high temperatures in some areas, and tornados and flooding in others.

The legislation would allow companies and public agencies to compulsorily buy land to construct the infrastructure. However, according to  The Guardian , the monarch officials gained an exemption through a process called the Queen's consent. This is a mechanism through which the monarch can see legislation that affects her interests in advance and give approval for it to progress. The media outlet said that in January a top Scottish official wrote to the Queen's most senior aide asking for her consent to the legislation. Her lawyers reportedly raised concerns with the Bill and documents show Paul Wheelhouse, the then-Scottish Energy Minister, agreed to an amendment addressing the issue. A courtier for the Queen later said she had given her consent to the Bill.\u00a0 The Guardian  says that when the legislation was introduced, an amendment was filed preventing companies or agencies from compelling the Queen to sell her land for pipelines to be built.\u00a0 One politician who objected to the amendment as it gave the Queen special treatment told The Guardian that he was \"shocked to discover that the amendment was put in place in order to secure Queen's consent\".\u00a0 \"That should have been stated in the debate.

In it, the group concludes the current Government has \"hollowed out or removed\" policies aimed at reducing New Zealand's dependence on oil and coal, and has allowed the price of carbon to \"crash to near zero\". \"At present the Government's own figures say we're headed in the wrong direction,\" lead author and Generation Zero policy spokesman Paul Young said on Firstline this morning. The report argues New Zealand should seek to emulate Denmark, which plans to be entirely powered by renewable sources by 2050. \"That sounds like a very ambitious proposition, but they've done the analysis and they believe it's possible for them, and they've got across-the-board political commitment to a plan to make it happen,\" says Mr Young. \"That's really exactly the approach we want to see here in New Zealand to get us moving in the right direction.\" In contrast, he says our Government's vision is \"virtually indistinguishable from 'business-as-usual\", despite growing concern about the effects of rising temperatures. The report states that compared to current Government policy, doing nothing at all would only increase carbon emissions by 0.4 percent by 2030. And though most of our electricity now comes from renewable sources, more needs to be done. \"New Zealand's got a proud history of renewable energy, and it's something that is a big advantage for us. But in terms of energy it's important to note that it's more than just electricity; we're talking about transport and the energy that we're using in industries, and there's a lot more that we could be doing there,\" says Mr Young. \"We need a comprehensive plan that's going to tackle all of those areas; that's what Denmark has and we are lacking.\" Climate Change Minister Tim Groser says New Zealand is committed to meeting its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, but that some of the negative effects of climate change \"can't be avoided\" and adaptation is important.

New Zealand has been  ranked middle-of-the-pack  when it comes to fighting climate change in a new report. The  2021 Climate Change Performance Index  (CPPI) puts us in 25th place out of 58 countries and the European Union, covering more than 90 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0 But in the report's formal list, we're actually 28th out of 61 - the experts behind the CPPI determining no nations were performing well enough to deserve gold, silver or bronze.\u00a0 \"No country performs well enough in all index categories to achieve an overall very high rating in the index. Therefore, once again the first three ranks of the overall ranking remain empty,\" the report, released Tuesday, reads.\u00a0 It's an improvement on our 2019 ranking of 44th (or 41st, no country doing enough to meet their Paris Agreement obligations that year either). In 2006, we were ranked 31st.\u00a0 The scores are based on four areas - emissions, renewable energy, energy use and climate policy.\u00a0 New Zealand performs poorly in this category, ranking 44th out of 61 (no country being deemed worthy of positions one, two and three). This shouldn't be surprising, considering New Zealand has increased its emissions 24 percent since the 1990s - unlike countries such as the UK and Sweden who have cut emissions over the past three decades. Other countries performing well in this category include Egypt, Chile, Malta, Morocco, Norway, Switzerland, India, Denmark, Croatia and France. Last place is Kazakhstan, whose growing dependence on fossil fuels is at odds with its Paris Agreement obligations. It actually boosted exports of oil and gas to help its economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. New Zealand does well here, coming in ninth (or sixth, for the reasons above). We're ranked 'high' with Latvia, Lithuania, the Nordic countries, Chile, Brazil, the UK, Ireland and others. About 40 percent of New Zealand's total energy use comes from renewables, and 80 percent of our electricity generation.\u00a0 Last is Iran, with Russia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Belarus, Mexico, Egypt and Canada also being ranked 'very low'. The US and Australia barely scrape into the 'low' category. This section tracks whether a nation's current energy use, and future plans and investments, will put it on track to meet Paris Agreement warming targets. New Zealand performs badly here, ranked 'low', mostly because of our high per-capita energy consumption. Our mark is slightly improved by the targets the Government has set and a  falling per-capita energy use , enough to put us in 44th (41st).\u00a0 The Ukraine tops this list, followed by Malta, Mexico, Morocco and Switzerland. The UK and South Africa also earned 'high' scores.\u00a0 Last is Canada, which gets only 16 percent of its energy from renewable sources, and has the world's third-biggest oil reserves. Saudi Arabia, the US, Finland, Australia and China also rank 'very low' in this category. New Zealand ranks 24th (21st) here, with its efforts deemed 'medium'. We're far behind front-runners Finland, Sweden, the UK, Latvia, Portugal and Denmark, but well ahead of Australia (second-to-last) and the United States (last place, after  pulling out of the Paris Agreement altogether last month ; President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to overturn this decision).\u00a0 \"The plans of president-elect [Joe] Biden present great opportunities for this assessment to improve significantly but only if the promises from the election campaign are actually delivered,\" wrote Niklas H\u00f6hne and Leonardo Nascimento of the Germany-based organisation NewClimate, which contributed to the report. \"Given the still unclear majority in the Senate, it is uncertain how much of this will be implemented.\" Putting together all the results, New Zealand - as mentioned earlier - ranks 28th (25th).\u00a0 Top place - or fourth - went to Sweden, followed by the UK, Denmark, Morocco, Norway, Chile, India, Finland, Malta and Latvia.\u00a0 But not even their efforts are enough. \"The results show that, even if all countries were as committed as the current frontrunners, efforts would still be insufficient to prevent hazardous climate change,\" the report states. Last place overall went to the United States, with wooden spoon runners-up including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, Taiwan, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Australia, South Korea and Russia.\u00a0 The CCPI has been published every year since 2005, and is presented at the United Nations Climate Change Conference.\u00a0", "headline": "Climate change: How New Zealand's efforts stack up against the world", "article_name": "climate-change-how-new-zealand-s-efforts-stack-up-against-the-world", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/12/climate-change-how-new-zealand-s-efforts-stack-up-against-the-world.html", "date_published": "2020-12-08 14:11:31", "article_length": 4568, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:44.104676"}

They talked the talk, but didn't walk the walk, the authors say. There was a stronger relationship between pro-environment intentions, than the actions.  It means while people who acknowledge climate change are more likely to agree something needs to be done about it, their behaviour doesn't reflect the same trend as strongly. \"This is not surprising given that intentions are less compromised by practical reality constraints than are behaviours, and so the relationship between beliefs and intentions is more 'pure',\" Professor Matthew Hornsey and colleagues  write in the paper , published today in journal Nature Climate Change.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Newshub Nation The ACT Party says  the government's being asked to \"ban and ban and tax its way out of climate change\"  by the Climate Commission. Leader David Seymour said the recommendations are to ban vehicles with internal combustion engines and new gas connections, to reduce herd sizes and increase taxes through the feebate scheme. He said the report should be binned and instead New Zealand should set a cap to reduce emissions in line with its partners, and \"let New Zealanders choose how they live, travel, and work within that cap\". Seymour said that if the rest of the world wanted to decarbonise, New Zealand should track them. \"It is dangerous for a small trading nation to get out of sync with its trading partners for reasons of diplomacy, trade, and consumer preferences. \"It would be foolish for New Zealand to 'lead' the world. Whether we like it or not we are a passenger on this journey, our emissions alone will not change the climate,\" he says. In place of the Zero Carbon Act, ACT would introduce a plan tying New Zealand's carbon price to the prices paid by its top five trading partners, he said. Climate Change Minister James Shaw told Midday Report the Commission's report was a call for the government to create more options for people to change habits and take advantage of practical alternatives to carbon-emitting ways of doing things. Shaw said the government needed to facilitate the necessary transition by planning for alternative modes of living. He said if the Commission report recommendations were implemented it would not only see a greater proportion of electric cars on the road, it would also be easier to get around towns and cities on public transport and other means of transport. \"What the Commission has said is that we really need to lift our game as a country, mostly in our big cities where greatest concentrations of transport exist. In those places there is a really strong call for ... urban design, not just laying out our streets, but actually making sure people are able to live close to work and they've got shopping and entertainment and other things that are more accessible than they are at the moment... \"But I think what the Commissioner is saying is we need to pull all of the levers that are available to us.\" The Commission wants to see all petrol vehicle imports banned by 2035 and Shaw said there was good reason for doing so, especially because other countries were planning to ban these too. \"One of the risks New Zealand faces is that, if we don't match them, then we will become a dumping ground for everybody's dirty, second-hand internal-combustion-engine vehicles.\" He said Finance Minister Grant Robertson's allocation of $300 million in the Budget towards incentivising the uptake of electric vehicles, and the biofuels mandate to power those internal combustion vehicles still on the roads after 2035, would help that transition away from fossil fuels and continued carbon pollution. He said the Commissioner wanted the government to make better travel options available to people. Shaw said he also expected farmers to play their part in creating a changed environment and that there was evidence they were taking ownership of that role themselves. \"By the time we get to 2025 every farmer in the country is supposed to have the ability to see what the sources of the emissions are on their farm and also what the carbon sequention opportunities are on their farm,\" he said. \"That was a really strong call from the sector - that they wanted farmers to be able to directly control what happens on their farm. And so generally speaking, with some exceptions, I think the sector is broadly on board ... that direction.\" Shaw said the problem and the solution was systemic, as there were prohibitive factors influencing people's behaviours. Making electric cars more affordable and creating alternative means of getting around without a private vehicle created an environment where people could make practical, realistic choices other than the narrow ones being made now. \"I think it's important not to say that it's all on individual behaviour because it isn't.

The dairy herd alone emits more than the entire transport sector\".\u00a0 \"Any politician serious about the climate emergency would accept the fact that there are too many cows, rather than berate educators for telling the truth.\" Patterson said there is \"danger\" in \"underplaying the nutritional benefits of dairy and red meat in a balanced diet\", telling Newshub it can help with iron deficiency.\u00a0 \"It will certainly be a topic for discussion when our caucus next meets.\" Jones and Patterson aren't the first MPs to criticise the teaching resource's advice to students to consume less meat, as well as other aspects of the material.\u00a0 National MP Scott Simpson  said there are \"some issues around dietary dogma, for instance, and the call to activism, and issues around how to handle people who have a different point of view - so-called deniers\".

Credits: Newshub Infrastructure and coastal areas will be examined based on vulnerability to climate-related hazards in the Government's new framework unveiled by James Shaw.\u00a0 Shaw, the Minister for Climate Change, released the National Climate Change Adaptation and Risk Assessment (NCCRA) Framework on Thursday.\u00a0 It is part of Shaw's Zero Carbon Bill submitted to Parliament in May, which sets a framework for New Zealand to develop climate change policies, and includes a mandate for undertaking an NCCRA.\u00a0 \"We're not waiting for the Zero Carbon Bill to pass before we get started,\" Shaw said. \"We've had a team who have developed an incredibly comprehensive and thorough approach to developing the risk assessment.\"\u00a0 The aim of it is to \"inform climate change adaptation and mitigation opportunities\" so New Zealand can be \"resilient and prepared\" for the effects of climate change.\u00a0 It will look at \"significant regional risks\", including those that would affect iwi, such as the emergence of sub-tropical pests and diseases and fish species into Northland or receding snowlines and glaciers.\u00a0 Infrastructure assets are a large part of the expenditure of local authorities, and will be a major part of the consideration, Shaw, also Greens co-leader, said.\u00a0 \"Infrastructure hangs around for decades and we want to make sure that we are not creating literal sunk assets.\"\u00a0 As for whether it could affect insurance premiums, Shaw said the industry is \"already starting to shift and are developing increasingly sophisticated models about the risks that are present in different locations\".\u00a0 He said the Government wants to work with the insurance industry.\u00a0 Climate change hazards are first going to have to be defined and it will need to be determined what impact each hazard could have.\u00a0 The state of change in these perceived hazards will need to be agreed on as well as an assessment process.\u00a0 Equally important will be identifying research gaps where strength of evidence is low for perceived risks or where there is deep uncertainty.\u00a0 The approach chosen to identify at-risk elements for the first NCCRA aligns with the Treasury's Living Standards Framework, which  shaped this year's Wellbeing Budget .\u00a0 Hazards will be categorised into primary and secondary risks. For example, change in annual rainfall will be split into hazardous effects that would be considered more at risk.\u00a0 Relative sea-level rise and change in tidal or increased water depth would be considered primary, while changes in waves and swell would be classed as secondary.\u00a0 The Government provided an example in the framework for what else will be considered: an X metre sea-level rise could lead to a significant national exposure of buildings and infrastructure.\u00a0 For a national-scale risk assessment, it is recommended hazards are developed for seven climate zones to represent the country's range of climates that \"may show significant differences in climate change impacts\".\u00a0 The framework notes that just because an area has no previous record of a particular hazard, it might in the future.

The co-founder of Sustainable Coastlines joined forces the community groups and they spent Friday at Lovells Rd in Cambridge to meet their goal.\u00a0 Supported by local schools and Black Sticks hockey team members, Judd says the efforts of nearly 150 volunteers put them ahead of their original target of 10,000 trees. He told Newshub nearly 6000 trees had been planted on Friday, with another full day of mucking in planned for Saturday. \"We've been smashing it,\" Judd told Newshub. \"It is the best thing that New Zealanders can do to address climate change; is plant trees on marginal land like this. \"If you look at the recent State of the Environment report, we are going in a bad trajectory when it comes to loss of threatened, native species.\" The Environment Aotearoa report found 90 percent of our seabirds and 76 percent of our freshwater fish are at risk of extinction. Once the project was complete, Judd hoped a number of native species, such as long-finned eels, would be able to thrive in the wetland environment. \"I think the key thing that we need to do is scale up on these types of efforts. \"We need to engage with multiple different groups in the community.\" Judd said they were proving when lots of groups come together for one cause, a difference can be made. \"We can actually start to see some hope in people that we can change some of those things that aren't going so well. \"Tomorrow [Saturday] is an open day for the public, and we're able to cater for very lunch numbers - we're looking for as many people as we can to just scale it up. \"The goal was 10,000 - I reckon we'll be able to get to about 12,500.\" Architectural Profiles Ltd (APL), ANZ and local charity the Ngati Haua Mahi Trust collaborated with them on the project. \"We will continue to strive towards creating a better future for generations to come,\" said Mikayla Plaw - APL general manager of organisational development and sustainability. \"The Waikato is our primary home and playground, we will therefore continue to support and enhance the region's environment.\" Newshub.", "headline": "Kiwi charity at forefront of fight against climate change ", "article_name": "planting-trees-best-way-to-fight-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/07/planting-trees-best-way-to-fight-climate-change.html", "date_published": "2019-07-05 16:30:39", "article_length": 2623, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:45.949318"}

The agreement between almost 200 states on December 12, 2015 was hailed as a potential turning point in efforts to contain global warming. It called for holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. While the long-term trend in global temperatures is now downwards, progress is insufficient, Fabius said, blaming a lack of political will among many governments, not least the United States under President Donald Trump. However, in an interview with Reuters, he highlighted some positive developments, including President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s pledge to bring the United States back into the accord. Governments have taken courageous financial and social decisions to halt the virus, but climate change poses an even graver threat, Fabius said. \"Unfortunately, we are not doing as much to fight climate change as we are to tackle the fallout from COVID,\" said Fabius, who was chief negotiator at the Paris talks and is now president of France\u2019s Constitutional Council. He said it was critical that in the global recovery from the pandemic, the rebound is \"green\" and money is not ploughed into old, polluting industries. The accord has brought some success, Fabius said. Scientific models had projected temperatures would increase 5 or 6 degrees and now estimated rises of 3 to 4 degrees by 2100. But this was still too high, he said. The thresholds set by the Paris Accord reflect scientists\u2019 beliefs that a rise in temperatures of more than 2 degrees would doom the planet to a future of rising sea levels, catastrophic floods, droughts and storms, and food and water shortages. Fabius, a former prime minister who was France\u2019s foreign minister at the time of the accord, recalled sleepless nights during two weeks of intense negotiations. The accord almost fell apart at the last moment. He has a cherished replica of the green wooden hammer: cheers erupted and diplomats hugged as his gavel came down. \"Since then, it\u2019s not been the same. In particular there was the backtracking by US President Donald Trump, which was bad for America but more so the rest of the world,\" he said. The United States, the world\u2019s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, formally exited the accord on November 4, a day after Election Day, fulfilling a Trump promise to withdraw. \"A certain number of countries said to themselves: if the world\u2019s biggest power doesn\u2019t respect its commitments, why should we?\" Fabius continued. But he said there had been a geopolitical shift in recent months. Biden has promised to rejoin the accord, China has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2060 and Japan by 2050. Fabius predicted that Biden\u2019s task will not be easy, with control of the US Senate still up for grabs and energy lobby groups wielding huge influence in Washington. \"(But) to move things we need every country in the world to act, not just one county.\" Reuters \u00a0 \n \n", "headline": "Climate change should be fought the same way world fought COVID-19 - Paris Accord chief negotiator ", "article_name": "climate-change-should-be-fought-the-same-way-world-fought-covid-19-paris-accord-chief-negotiator", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/12/climate-change-should-be-fought-the-same-way-world-fought-covid-19-paris-accord-chief-negotiator.html", "date_published": "2020-12-11 07:01:03", "article_length": 3145, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:46.318805"}

{"id": null, "body": "Watch: The effects of climate change are running away and humans are unequivocally to blame, according to the world's largest-ever report on Climate Change from the United Nations.  Credits: Image - Getty Images; Video - Newshub The UN climate panel sounded a dire warning Monday, saying the world is dangerously close to runaway warming and that humans are \"unequivocally\" to blame. Already, greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere are high enough to guarantee climate disruption for decades if not centuries, scientists warn in  a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\u00a0 That's on top of the deadly heat waves, powerful hurricanes and other weather extremes that are happening now and are likely to become more severe. Describing the report as a \"code red for humanity,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged an immediate end to coal energy and other high-polluting fossil fuels. \"The alarm bells are deafening,\" Guterres said in a statement. \"This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet.\" The IPCC report comes just three months before a major UN climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, where nations will be under pressure to pledge ambitious climate action and substantial financing. Drawing on more than 14,000 scientific studies, the report gives the most comprehensive and detailed picture yet of how climate change is altering the natural world - and what still could be ahead. Unless immediate, rapid and large-scale action is taken to reduce emissions, the report says, the average global temperature will likely cross the 1.5-degree Celsius warming threshold within the next 20 years. So far, nations' pledges to cut emissions have been inadequate for bringing down the level of greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere. Reacting to the findings, governments and campaigners expressed alarm. \"The IPCC report underscores the overwhelming urgency of this moment,\" US climate envoy John Kerry said in a statement. \"The world must come together before the ability to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is out of reach.\" Emissions \"unequivocally caused by human activities\" have pushed today's average global temperature 1.1C higher than the preindustrial average -- and would have pushed it 0.5C further if not for the tempering effect of pollution in the atmosphere, the report says. That means that, as societies transition away from fossil fuels, much of the aerosols in the air would vanish - and temperatures could spike. Scientists warn that warming more than 1.5C above the preindustrial average could trigger runaway climate change with catastrophic impacts, such as heat so intense that crops fail or people die just from being outdoors. Every additional 0.5C of warming will also boost the intensity and frequency of heat extremes and heavy rainfall, as well as droughts in some regions. Because temperatures fluctuate from year to year, scientists measure climate warming in terms of 20-year averages. \"We have all the evidence we need to show we are in a climate crisis,\" said three-time IPCC co-author Sonia Seneviratne, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich who doubts she will sign up for a fourth report. \"Policy makers have enough information. You can ask: Is it a meaningful use of scientists' time, if nothing is being done?\" The 1.1C warming already recorded has been enough to unleash disastrous weather. This year, heat waves killed hundreds in the Pacific Northwest and smashed records around the world. Wildfires fueled by heat and drought are sweeping away entire towns in the US West, releasing record emissions from Siberian forests, and driving Greeks to flee their lands by ferry.\u00a0 \"Every bit of warming matters,\" said IPCC co-author Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading in Britain. \"The consequences get worse and worse as we get warmer.\" Greenland's ice sheet is \"virtually certain\" to continue melting. Oceans will keep warming, with surface levels rising for centuries to come. It's too late to prevent these particular changes. The best the world can do is to slow them down so that countries have more time to prepare and adapt. \"We are now committed to some aspects of climate change, some of which are irreversible for hundreds to thousands of years,\" said IPCC co-author Tamsin Edwards, a climate scientist at King's College London. \"But the more we limit warming, the more we can avoid or slow down those changes.\" But even to slow climate change, the report says, the world is running out of time. If the world drastically cuts emissions in the next decade, average temperatures could still rise 1.5C by 2040 and possibly 1.6C by 2060 before stabilizing. If the world does not cut emissions dramatically and instead continues the current trajectory, the planet could see 2.0C warming by 2060 and 2.7C by the century's end. The earth has not been that warm since the Pliocene Epoch roughly 3 million years ago -- when the first ancestors to humans were appearing and oceans were 25 meters higher than today. It could get even worse, if warming triggers feedback loops that release even more climate-warming carbon emissions - such as the melting of Arctic permafrost or the dieback of global forests. Under these high-emissions scenarios, Earth could broil at temperatures 4.4C above the preindustrial average by 2081-2100. \"We have already changed our planet, and some of those changes we will have to live with for centuries and millennia to come,\" said IPCC co-author Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.

Federated Farmers' climate change spokesperson Andrew Hoggard said introducing children to the science behind climate change is positive and worthwhile, but it needs to be balanced. \"Teachers will need to present and explain the pros and cons of various courses of action in response to global warming, and in particular guard against the lessons fostering feelings of panic or hopelessness,\" said Hoggard. He said while much of the material in the 'Prepare today, live well tomorrow' teacher resource was instructive and compelling, he claimed some of it was misleading.\u00a0 \"For example, there's a section that urges people to buy local food and products as they haven't had to travel so far in a vehicle which uses fossil fuels.\" He said the suggestion was simplistic, as New Zealand produce had a low environmental footprint. \"Per kilogram of protein, produce from New Zealand farmers can reach consumers in most parts of the world with a lower greenhouse gas/environmental footprint than is achieved by many local producers.\" The resource also implied eating red meat was wrong and environmentally damaging, he said. \"Again, that's a misleading generalisation here unless other factors are explained, including nutritional needs, that New Zealand doesn't have the industrial livestock feedlots common in some other parts of the world, and that we have a role in another pressing challenge facing humankind - hunger in a growing world population.\" A United Nations report on the effects of climate change last year said global meat consumption needed to fall to curb global warming, reduce growing strain on land and water and improve food security, health and biodiversity. It called for big changes to farming and eating habits to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on stretched land and water resources. Federated Farmers wanted to see more input from farmers to the new teaching resource. \"Schools could invite farmers to come in and talk to students or even better they could get on board with the 'Open Farm' programme and kids could visit farms to see for themselves what happens there.\"\u00a0 Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw  told Magic Talk's Sean Plunket  the resource, modelled on a trial at New Brighton School in Christchurch, was based on science.

The most efficiently produced beef takes 36 times more land to produce than peas, according to the research, and created six times the emissions. \"I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project,\" lead researcher Joseph Poore told  The Guardian . \"These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life.

Oxfam NZ executive director Barry Coates is in Cancun, and told 3 News progress is being made. \"A final agreement's not going to happen in Cancun, but hopefully the finance part will,\" he says. \"One of the most important achievements would be a fair climate fund. This would help to rebuild trust and put the talks back on track.\" Oxfam wants rich countries to help poorer nations deal with climate change, since rich countries are the cause of most climate-related issues, yet the effects are felt most strongly in poorer nations. \"Our Pacific neighbours are struggling with the impacts of climate change,\" he says. \"This is not aid. This is about vulnerable communities protecting themselves from a problem that they did not cause.\" The lack of any deal at last year's talks in Copenhagen took the media spotlight off this year's meet. Mr Coates called the lack of any deal a \"spectacular failure\". \"There was a big build up to Copenhagen,\" he says. \"It was the world's biggest climate change conference, the world's biggest ever environmental conference. There was quite a dashing of expectations. \"There was a consensus of expectations being let down, so things have gone a little bit quiet.\" The reverse is true for the world's climate itself.

Though an overall agreement to tackle climate change is highly unlikely to come from Cancun, Mr Coates says there are \"building blocks\" for a final deal he hopes will come together at next year's talks in Durban,  South Africa. But apart from reducing emissions and helping poorer nations, Mr Coates says New Zealand should take advantage of opportunities presented by the growing awareness of climate change. \"The one thing that's really changed over the past year is that many countries have stopped seeing climate change as a cost,\" says Mr Coates. \"They are seeing that there are business opportunities in climate change, and the countries that move fast will do well.\" He says if New Zealand wants to have any other future than being a commodity producer, we had better join become one of those countries.  3 News source: newshub archive", "headline": "Oxfam NZ fighting for climate change fund", "article_name": "oxfam-nz-fighting-for-climate-change-fund-2010113012", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/environmentsci/oxfam-nz-fighting-for-climate-change-fund-2010113012", "date_published": "1970-01-01 15:12:00", "article_length": 2621, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:48.679287"}

It makes sense to New Zealand's School Strike 4 Climate leader Sophie Handford, who told Newshub children give adults a new perspective. \"When their children stand up and say 'actually climate change puts my own future at risk' then that's something that I think no adult really wants for their child, so I think that's quite powerful.\" Hundreds of thousands of children around the world have walked out of school over the past few months, protesting a lack of action on the climate from the adults in charge. Handford said the protests have increased conversation about the environment in homes. \"So whether it's the kids seeing something on TV and asking their parents what it's about, maybe a parent raising it with their kid about whether it's been spoken about at their school, I think it's been raised in quite a few different ways.\" Researchers from North Carolina State University trained 15 teachers to use a curriculum intended to provoke children to talk to their parents about climate change. The researchers then measured the impact on children and their parents over the next two years.

I'm really not sure when for many New Zealanders part of having days where you don't eat meat is a reality because they can't afford the meat.\" The teaching resource, almost about two weeks ago by Education Minister Chris Hipkins and Climate Change Minister James Shaw, tells students how they can help to reduce emissions by eating \"less meat and dairy\". The advice sparked an angry response from Martin's New Zealand First colleagues Winston Peters and Shanes Jones - both Cabinet ministers - and Mark Patterson, the party's spokesperson for agriculture. \"I don't want the politically correct brigade colonising my dietary habits - it will never, ever happen... Schools have absolutely no authority to stigmatise and demonise us meat-eaters,\"  Jones told Newshub last week .\u00a0 Peters, the Deputy Prime Minister,  supported Jones  and suggested to Magic Talk that the prospect of eating less meat could damage the country's agriculture industry and lead to job losses.\u00a0 \"Exports give people jobs in this country and you've got this group of elitists challenging the very existence of these jobs by their extremist, absolutist statements.\" Patterson described the dietary advice as \"out of context\" and said grass-fed New Zealand dairy, beef and lamb \"have a much lower carbon footprint\" than overseas grain-fed factory farm systems.

She pointed to one of the resource's recommendations to have \"meatless Mondays\", arguing it's \"not a new concept\" and one that she grew up familiar with. \"I don't know about you, but in my lifetime I've lived both as a child and as a parent at a time when we couldn't afford to eat meat every day of the week.\" The minister also addressed concerns about an activity in the resource - for year 7-10 students - called \"myth buster role-play\" where one student will play the role of an 'activist' for climate change and the other a 'sceptic'. ACT leader David Seymour  described the activity as \"terrible\" .\u00a0 \"I just think that sort of exercise, given that it doesn't provide any sort of resource or credence to why people might be sceptical, amounts to state-organised bullying of kids.\" Martin defended it, saying: \"Please don't tell me that we don't have activists and we don't have sceptics around this topic in the real world.\" The minister explained how halfway through the task students swap roles, \"so they're not asking the students to take that role and be that - they're asking the students to actually have an intelligent debate\". She explained how the teaching resource is \"helping our young people to actually participate... It's teaching them to do so respectfully\". \"I think if you look at it objectively and realise that this is about our children having a constructive conversation and finding the answers for themselves.\" The National Party says it might  make changes to the resource , or perhaps withdraw it altogether if elected to power this year.\u00a0 You can read more about the resource  here .", "headline": "New Zealand First MP Tracey Martin defends climate change teaching resource", "article_name": "new-zealand-first-mp-tracey-martin-defends-climate-change-teaching-resource", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/new-zealand-first-mp-tracey-martin-defends-climate-change-teaching-resource.html", "date_published": "2020-01-22 14:58:16", "article_length": 4067, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:49.935487"}

During an interview with Auckland newspaper the Western Leader earlier this week, Ms Crone said climate change was \"a very contentious debate\" and she would need to \"sit down and have a thorough briefing\" on it, and \"have a look at all the facts\". \u00a0 \"Of course you've got erosion right across Auckland, in terms of seabed and creeping into beaches and playgrounds and things like that,\" she told the paper. \"Whether you then say that's because of humans or it's actually a cycle, I'm not going to kind of get drawn into that debate.\" For climate scientists there is no debate, but Ms Crone says there definitely is amongst voters.  \"As I've been going across Auckland for the past nine months, I can tell you there is a lot of contentious debate amongst Aucklanders as to the cause of climate change and the council's role in that. That's what I was referring to,\" she told Paul Henry on Thursday. \"I'm not talking about scientists' views here - I'm talking about general Aucklanders.\" Asked point-blank if she believes in human-induced climate change, she said she does - but many potential voters don't. \"Aucklanders don't have a consensus view on this.

It's about recognising there is a contentious debate out there.\" Her rival for the mayoralty Phil Goff said Ms Crone's comments were \"a mistake\", and Green Party co-leader James Shaw said climate change is \"only contentious if you believe that things like chemistry and physics are contentious\".  Ms Crone, former managing director\u00a0of tech company Xero, is likely to come a distant second to Mr Goff.

Shaw's declaration follows the release of the  latest annual report on the country's greenhouse gases . The New Zealand Greenhouse Gas Inventory provides the most up-to-date information regarding how much work needs to be done to make an impact on climate change.\u00a0 The annual report provides the official estimates of all human-generated greenhouse gas emissions and removals that have occurred in New Zealand since 1990. It covers carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. \"Narrowing the gap between where we are now and where we need to be is the difference between handing our children a better world, or more crises in the future,\" Shaw said in a statement on Tuesday. \"People are understandably worried about their immediate future, which is why we must continue to do everything we can to reduce the economic pressures [that] people and businesses... are facing. However, we can do that in a way that also helps the climate.\" \"When we look at the pathway to zero net emissions by 2050, there are two things that stand out from this report - firstly, we have a long way to go, but secondly, that the scale of what is required goes beyond what current policies will achieve,\" Shaw explained.\u00a0 \"Building on our track record of progress is going to be crucial if we are to solve climate change and create a better future for our kids and grandkids.\" Shaw also highlighted the measures introduced by the Labour Government in the fight against climate change, claiming that successive governments have long acted with \"little regard\" for the environment.\u00a0 The report does not show what impact COVID-19 has had on emissions. As it takes about 15 months to collect and analyse the data for each year and prepare it for the inventory's publication, the impacts of COVID-19 won\u2019t be fully known until the 2022 inventory. \"We have an opportunity to change the quality of our economic growth and reduce its impact on the climate,\" Shaw said. \"Our goal is to transition to a net-zero carbon economy in a way that gives people good job opportunities and certainty about how they will provide for their families.\"", "headline": "Climate change: New Zealand's annual emissions report shows 'limited progress' - James Shaw", "article_name": "climate-change-new-zealand-s-annual-emissions-report-shows-limited-progress-james-shaw", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/04/climate-change-new-zealand-s-annual-emissions-report-shows-limited-progress-james-shaw.html", "date_published": "2020-04-15 15:11:08", "article_length": 2441, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:50.564591"}
{"id": null, "body": "Climate change - what New Zealanders have to change and when.  Credits: Video - Newshub Nation; Image - Reuters Ice in Greenland and Antarctica is melting so fast, it's overtaking scientists' worst-case scenarios, a new study has found. When climate scientists use computer modelling to predict what the effects of greenhouse gases will be in the future, they usually provide a range of possibilities. Such was the case in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's last big wrap of the scientific data - the  Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2014 . \"Although we anticipated the ice sheets would lose increasing amounts of ice in response to the warming of the oceans and atmosphere, the rate at which they are melting has accelerated faster than we could have imagined,\" said Tom Slater, climate researcher at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds, who led  the new research . \"The melting is overtaking the climate models we use to guide us, and we are in danger of being unprepared for the risks posed by sea level rise.\" The new study looked at the IPCC's predictions from 2014 and what is actually happening on the ground at the poles, where most of the world's ice is located. The loss matched the worst-case scenarios laid out by the world's top climate scientists. \"We need to come up with a new worst-case scenario for the ice sheets because they are already melting at a rate in line with our current one,\" Dr Slater told AFP. The problem is while the forecasts generally look at climate over decades, short-term fluctuations in weather - itself influenced by climate change - have driven an increase in melting at the poles, which are warming faster than the rest of the planet. If all of Greenland's ice melted, it would drive sea levels up about six metres, and Antarctica 60m.\u00a0 Interactive sea level maps  show a 6m rise would submerge entire low-lying Auckland suburbs like Rosebank and Favona, as well as most of the city's airport.\u00a0 If both Antarctica and Greenland's ice melted, Auckland would be an archipelago. The CBD, Mt Wellington, Otahuhu, Papatoetoe, Manurewa, Blockhouse Bay, Botany, Henderson and Devonport would all be under the sea. The ocean would even bury inland cities like Hamilton, coming down through the Hauraki Plains, and Palmerston North. Most of downtown Wellington would be gone too, and Christchurch would be completely wiped out.\u00a0 Ice melting isn't the only way the sea rises. Most of it so far has been due to thermal expansion - warm water simply takes up more space than cold. It's believed ice melt has moved into first place in the last few years. In August, scientists studying Greenland's glaciers said the melting had  gone past the point of no return  - there's no longer enough snow to replenish what's being lost to the ocean. Another group found it  lost more ice last year than ever before  - 482 billion tonnes, 60 tonnes for every person on Earth.\u00a0 \"It is not only Antarctica and Greenland that are causing the water to rise,\" said Ruth Mottram, climate researcher at the Danish Meteorological Institute who contributed to the new research. \"In recent years, thousands of smaller glaciers have begun to melt or disappear altogether, as we saw with the glacier Ok in Iceland, which was declared 'dead' in 2014.\u00a0 The research  was carried out at the University of Leeds and published in journal  Nature Climate Change.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Councils could be liable for up to $13 billion to replace infrastructure - or \"far beyond\" that figure - if measures aren't taken to prevent or adapt to sea level rises right away, according to a new report. And the cost to the private sector could run into tens of billions, insurers have warned. The report -  Vulnerable: The Quantum of Local Government Infrastructure Exposed to Sea Level Rise  - was commissioned by Local Government NZ (LGNZ) and  released on Friday morning . \"As this study highlights, roughly 65 per cent of New Zealanders live within five kilometres of the ocean, and an increasing number of councils will face significant policy and financial challenges as the sea continues to encroach on them,\" said LGNZ president Dave Cull. If the sea level rises 1.5m by 2100 - which is at the higher end of scientists' predictions - the report says the cost of replacing council infrastructure would be $8 billion. At 3m - which isn't outside the realms of probability - this would rise to $13 billion. Low-lying Canterbury will be hardest-hit, followed by Hawke's Bay, Auckland, Wellington, Bay of Plenty, Otago and Waikato. Almost half the total would need to be spent replacing swamped drinking, storm and waste water assets. If the sea gets higher, bridges, landfills, green space, airports and treatment plants would also be affected. Even the almost-certain rise of only 0.5m would see $1.4 billion in damage done to council infrastructure. A 1.5m rise would see 2100km of local roads underwater, and 3m would drown 4559km, with a replacement cost of $2.3 billion - and this doesn't include bridges. \"This report should have everyone sitting up and listening,\" said chief executive of the Insurance Council of NZ Tim Grafton, adding that others stand to lose even more. \"We believe the full cost of exposure to central government and private sector property will be in the tens of billions of dollars... This is not just an issue for local government. Central government has a key role to play too and ultimately carries the economic, social and political risk if adapting to sea-level rise is not well managed.\" Minister for Climate Change James Shaw said the report highlights the \"sheer magnitude of devastation\" sea level rises can cause. \"It would destroy critical infrastructure that allows our communities to function and thrive. The consequences of that are frightening. To delay or weaken our stance would be to the detriment of New Zealand communities.\" The report says we have \"roughly 25 years\" to get ready before all that will be left to do is park an \"ambulance at the bottom of a metaphorical hill\". \"Costs will likely go far beyond tangible measures; not only will infrastructure be exposed, so will potential economic development and growth, community health and safety, and social support systems.\" Actions proposed by LGNZ to mitigate and adapt to the threat include:\u00a0 Mr Shaw says the Government isn't wasting any time. \"The challenges can be met, and the best way to do that is to gather the best information we can, along with the best community involvement and expert advice possible to put strategies in place sooner rather than later.\" The Insurance Council says every dollar invested now \"to reduce and adapt to risk\" will save many more in the future. Earlier this week, the West Coast Regional Council made a submission against the Government's Zero Carbon Bill,  saying it needed proof climate change was being caused by humans .

One even said they felt \"a little sick\" at times, and that it was time for politicians to \"do their job\" and fix it.\u00a0 The epic  AR6 Climate Change 2021 - Sixth Assessment Report  from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is nearly 4000 pages, bringing together years of research from climate scientists from around the world.\u00a0 It paints a horrifying picture of what humanity is doing to the climate, saying 50-year heatwaves could become almost annual events and not ruling out a sea level rise of 15m in the next couple of hundred years and 22m in the next two millennia if emissions aren't reined in.\u00a0 \"They've made it an absolute statement of fact - that humanity is causing climate breakdown,\" Oxfam Aotearoa executive director Rachel Le Mesurier told The AM Show on Tuesday. \"We all know about the frog in the boiling water, don't we?\u00a0 What we've actually got now is we're in this warm water and there are bubbles coming up around us.\" \"It makes for very sobering reading,\" Green Party co-leader James Shaw told Newshub. \"It's very clear the window of opportunity is closing, but there is still time if we act now. This report's a really big deal - there's something like 14,000 scientific reports that have gone into it. This is the global view of the science community around the world.\u00a0 \"We need to act urgently and we need to act comprehensively right across the economy, in every community, in every sector of the economy, to start to reduce our emissions over a sustained period of time.\"\u00a0 New Zealand won't escape the effects of the warming climate. We're mentioned dozens of times in the report. Our mean temperature has increased about 1.1C since records began (page 3522 of the report), \"with human influence the dominant driver\".\u00a0 \"Decreases in snow and ice or increases in pluvial/river flooding will affect sectors such as winter tourism, energy production, river transportation, and infrastructure,\" it says on page 132 - and that's just with 2C of warming compared to pre-industrial times, which we'll likely reach by mid-century at the present rate. \"Fire weather is projected to increase throughout Australia and New Zealand,\" it reads on page 136 - again, with just 2C of warming. \"Fire weather is projected to increase throughout Australia and New Zealand. Snowfall is expected to decrease throughout the region at high altitudes in both Australia and New Zealand, with glaciers receding in New Zealand.\" Wellington and Dunedin in particular will become far more at risk of fires, the report said (page 3197).\u00a0 The south and west of the country will likely get wetter while the north and east dry up (also page 3197). \"As the climate warms, the tracks of storms are moving towards the poles in many regions, notably across the Southern Hemisphere,\" said James Renwick, one of the report's lead authors and a climate change professor at Victoria University.\u00a0 \"At the same time, the high-pressure regions in the subtropics are expanding polewards. The net effects for New Zealand are that the west and south will see increases in precipitation in winter and spring, while the north and east will see reductions.\" Rivers will be more likely to flood, marine heatwaves will become more common and last longer, particularly coming from the Tasman Sea (also page 3197). The ocean around New Zealand has warmed more quickly than the global average (page 3200), particularly around the South Island.\u00a0 If temperatures rise more than 3C New Zealand will likely lose all of its glaciers, the report says on page 2160, along with up to three-quarters of glaciers around the globe.\u00a0 There will be between 30 and 50 percent fewer 'frost days' than there used to be (page 3194). \"Agricultural and ecological\" droughts will be more common (page 3196), landslides will be more likely in the South Island and eastern half of the North Island thanks to \"total precipitation rates, precipitation intensity, mountain permafrost thaw rates, glacier retreat and air temperature\" (page 3195) and there will be a \"continuing reduction in snowfall during the 21st century\" (page 3198).\u00a0 From 2030, areas below 1500m will likely go without snow for entire years. \"As mean sea-level rise is projected to continue for at least several more centuries, there is very high confidence that this will lead to large increases in the frequency of extreme sea-level events in Australia and New Zealand,\" the report says on page 3518.\u00a0 Many New Zealanders were involved in the science behind the report, as well as writing it. One of those, University of Canterbury international relations professor Bronwyn Hayward, said the report showed things are getting worse much faster than the IPCC's 2018 report predicted.\u00a0 \u201cThe report doesn\u2019t put a precise date on when we know we have crossed the dangerous threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, but says unless we make far-reaching change, this will occur over the next 20 years using average temperatures. This will expose many more people and our natural environment to even more devastating consequences including intense flooding, storms and unprecedented droughts and fires.\" Kiwi cities are particularly at risk, she said, \"as hotspots where the experience of localised heat and flooding will be more intense than global averages. This matters because cities in New Zealand are already home to nearly 90 per cent of our population.\"\u00a0 She said it was time to stop \"magical thinking\" that technology would solve the problem before it was too late.\u00a0 Iain White, a professor of environmental planning at the University of Waikato, thought he was desensitised to alarming climate reports before sitting down to read this latest one.\u00a0 \"I actually felt a little sick at a couple of paragraphs. I feel for the scientists who have to put this together.\" He said the emissions reduction plan the Government is required to deliver by the end of this year will be \"vitally important\", but is sceptical authorities will act with enough urgency.\u00a0 \"At the same time as politicians in Wellington react to this report with concern, climate advocacy groups are suing Auckland Transport and Auckland Council over a long-term Land Transport Plan that fails to reduce emissions. It\u2019s a sign that our institutions helped create the current situation, and action may involve new governance structures or fundamental changes to leadership, budgets, or sectors.\" He also pointed to locals who oppose efforts to make streets safer and better for cyclists and pedestrians over cars. \"If anyone is in doubt at the scale of the challenge, reflect on how hard it was to reorient just a few individual streets towards walking and cycling during the Innovating Streets trial. Now do that to a city. Or a sector.\" Nick Cradock-Henry, a scientist at Landcare Research, said drought was now \"Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s costliest hazard, with economic and social implications for rural communities\" - and the report predicts things will only get worse - and farmers need to adapt, as well as cut emissions.\u00a0 \"Mitigation will be insufficient to address the changes in climate presented here. To ensure sustainable long-term futures for Aotearoa New Zealand, the report is a stark reminder of the need for adaptation. Adaptation will require strategic and even radical adjustments to practices, processes, capital, and infrastructure in response to climate change, and must begin now.\u201d Sara Mikaloff-Fletcher of NIWA said New Zealand's strategy of offsetting carbon emissions with new forests will become increasingly infeasible. \"Models predict extreme temperatures and droughts brought on by climate change will weaken the ability of forests and other green spaces to absorb carbon dioxide. This is particularly significant for Aotearoa New Zealand, because our forests and land use offsets roughly a third of our total greenhouse gas emissions.\" Luke Harrington, a senior research fellow at Victoria University's Climate Change Research Institute said the report's predictions for New Zealand were likely the most accurate yet.\u00a0 \"Some climate models can struggle with our thin, mountainous wedge of land sticking out of the ocean. The emphasis on never using climate models beyond their limitations, understanding precisely what those limitations are, and always working with local knowledge and contexts when making local decisions, seems to ring true for Aotearoa just as with the rest of the world - particularly as we adapt to an ever-changing climate over the coming decades.\" Lauren Vargo, a research fellow at Victoria University's Antarctic Research Centre, said seafood around New Zealand would be impacted. \"The impacts on New Zealand will likely include: sea level rise, which will lead to more frequent and extreme flooding and erosion; increases in extreme rain and flooding in some regions, but increases in drought in other regions; decreases in glacier ice and seasonal snow, leading to impacts on water resources, hydropower, and tourism; and increases in ocean warming, which will impact resources like seafood in New Zealand.\"", "headline": "Climate change: What the new IPCC report says is in store for New Zealand", "article_name": "climate-change-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-is-in-store-for-new-zealand", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/08/climate-change-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-is-in-store-for-new-zealand.html", "date_published": "2021-08-10 13:19:30", "article_length": 9378, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:51.139044"}

The new Ministry of Education  resource  available for New Zealand students in years 7-10 tells them climate scientists agree that \"humanity is responsible for the vast majority of the enhanced greenhouse effect\".\u00a0 It includes eight lessons on topics such as understanding the difference between climate and weather, how climate change could affect New Zealand, and New Zealand's current commitments to tackling the issue.\u00a0 Teachers are also provided a \"wellbeing guide\" to \"help them navigate the delivery of climate change scientific content, whilst maintaining the wellbeing/hauora of students\".\u00a0 Students who choose to take the course will learn about understanding their feelings about climate change and how it will have \"direct and indirect impacts on psychological wellbeing\".\u00a0 \"Learning and understanding about climate change affects people even without exposure to a direct event, and may create anxiety, depression, despair, aggression and a host of other emotional upheavals.\" The resource says climate-related extreme weather events could cause stress, anxiety, grief, social tension, feelings of displacement, relationship conflicts, cognitive decline, problems with alcohol and drugs, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\u00a0 In one lesson, students are asked to get in groups and \"choose one climate change feeling response (their own or imaginary)\" and consider feelings associated with climate change.\u00a0 \"During this discussion, reinforce key messages about feelings and highlight how our feelings are linked to thinking, physical responses, action and the environment,\" the curriculum says.\u00a0\u00a0 \"We can listen to our body for signals of how we are feeling. Everyone has thoughts about the things that happen. How people think influences how they feel and behave. Feelings are connected to our motivations and actions.\" Students are taught how to psychologically adapt to climate change in three steps: Students are also instructed on how to communicate with people who aren't convinced that the climate is changing or that humans are impacting the changing climate significantly.\u00a0\u00a0 \"As the students learn more about climate change, they may also hear, read about, or speak with, those who disagree with the science behind climate change,\" the resource says.\u00a0 \"This could cause confusion and anxiety, especially if it appears that because of that denial or lack of understanding, the urgent action required to mitigate and adapt to climate change is stalled.\" The syllabus provides a list of \"myths\" that have been \"busted\" by scientists - although it does not provide a source on the page.\u00a0 An example of a \"myth\" provided in the resource: \"Humans are too insignificant to affect global climate\".

It also instructs them to not make it personal, to \"listen to the other point of view\", and to use \"I\" statements to communicate how they feel.\u00a0 The students are then instructed to participate in an activity called \"myth buster role-play\" where one student will be the 'activist' for climate change and the other the 'sceptic'.\u00a0 The syllabus includes a YouTube video of Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who last year rallied students across the world - including New Zealand - to protest against inaction from leaders.\u00a0 \"At a young age, Greta Thunberg recognised that there was a huge disconnect between the evidence from climate experts and the actions being taken in society,\" the resource says. \"Frustrated by this lack of action, she decided to take matters into her own hands.\" The curriculum cites various sources including the Ministry for the Environment, Stats NZ, the Department of Conservation, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations Environment Program's climate body.\u00a0 Students are taught New Zealand's commitments, including the 2015 Paris Agreement, the purpose of which is to keep the global average temperature well below 2degC above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5degC.

This is false. At least 95 percent of scientists in the field believe there is sufficient evidence to support the existence of climate change caused largely by human activities, so-called \"anthropogenic global warming\". The consensus is mainly channelled through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the main international body for the evaluation of the phenomenon, set up in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organisation, of which 195 countries are members. In their most recent report published in September, more than 100 scientists warned of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the magnitude of changes to oceans and ice sheets. The effects of the earth's natural cycles have nothing to do with the global warming recorded in the last century. The three natural causes of climate variability are sunspots, an indicator whose periodicity is about 11 years; changes in the earth's orbital cycles, which operate on scales of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years; and volcanic eruptions. \"Since there is an instrumental registry, more than 100 years ago, none of the three natural causes explain global warming and the patterns are completely different,\" said Fernando Valladares, a researcher on the Higher Council for Scientific Research. Sunspots are indicative of changes in the sun's activity that occur every decade and are not related to rising temperatures in the past 60 or 70 years. The Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC, published in 2014, contributed to the falsity that global warming was interrupted in 1998, which stated that the average temperature had shown a linear trend of a smaller increase in the last 15 years (1998-2012) than in the 30-60 previous. But warming has not stopped at all. In fact, the average global temperature for the years 2015-2019 is on its way to being the warmest of any other registered equivalent period, one degree Celsius above pre-industrial times (1850-1900). This year will be among the five warmest ever due to climate change, according to WMO data. Sanz recalled that in 1998 there was a rise of almost 0.7C due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, but the general trend can only be measured with long historical series and reveals that the average temperature continues to rise. Valladares pointed out that the warmest four years of the past 150 were in the last decade. Moreno said 2018 was the fourth warmest year since records began. Warming favours business opportunities in some sectors and can even improve the health of those who live in the mountains or north of the 50th parallel, but the population benefited would be less than 5 percent of the total, Valladares said. The result is negative for humanity and, as Sanz warned, the increase in extreme phenomena will generate numerous economic outcomes and losses to human life. In the past 25 years, the sea level has risen an average of 8 centimetres (in some areas, more than 20cm). Climate change will also raise the risk of fires, cyclones and large droughts, trigger the salinisation of aquifers near coasts, reduce water availability, hinder the conservation of cold in industrial food facilities and threaten the electricity supply in large cities. The ozone layer protects life on earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays but warming is not caused by the direct effect of solar radiation, but by infrared radiation reflected by the planet and trapped by greenhouse gases, primarily CO2. The concentration of CO2 reached a record of 407.8 parts per million (ppm) last year, which could be even higher in 2019. To understand the dimension of the problem, the last time a concentration of 400ppm was recorded was more than 3 million years ago, when the global temperature was two or three degrees higher than the current one.\u00a0 AAP", "headline": "Debunking myths around the climate crisis", "article_name": "debunking-myths-around-the-climate-crisis", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2019/12/debunking-myths-around-the-climate-crisis.html", "date_published": "2019-12-04 09:10:00", "article_length": 4005, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:51.540335"}

In an interview with  Radio Waatea  on Monday, Jones likened activists to \"medieval torture chamber workers\" hellbent on \"preaching this gospel of absolutism\". Jones, who is the Minister of Forestry, Infrastructure and Regional Economic Development, made his opinions known following the Government's announcement that schools will receive new resources to teach children about climate change.\u00a0 On Sunday, January 12, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced that  school children will be taught \"the role science plays in understanding climate change\" , as well as \"the response to it and its impacts, globally, nationally and locally\". The resource also explores opportunities to reduce and adapt to the impacts of climate change \"on everyday life\". The 'Climate Change - Prepare Today, Live Well Tomorrow' resource was trialled at Christchurch's New Brighton School in 2018 and includes video, text and guidance for students. Green MP and Climate Change Minister James Shaw has suggested that children can help the fight against carbon emissions by reducing their meat intake in favour of a more plant-based diet. \"Children today are understandably growing up worried about how climate change will affect their lives... our zero-carbon legislation is an important framework for lasting change, but its success depends on all of us working every single day to take the ambitious action we need,\" Shaw said in a statement. Although Jones did not reference Shaw's comments specifically, he did reject the common dietary advice as \"absolutism\" perpetuated by \"bible bashers\". \"Absolutism is what we saw in the medieval days of putting people on the rack because there was an absolute sense of conviction that their perspective was the only perspective,\" he told the Auckland-based M\u0101ori station. Jones added that New Zealand First is \"deeply suspicious of any scientist\" who \"preaches\" ways to fight against climate change. \"This gospel of absolutism - we don't like that and we're not going to acquiesce in that. \"They want you to join their shrill voices.\" He noted that \"standing up for industry\" is not always hand-in-hand with \"denying the existence of changing climate and changing weather\".

{"id": null, "body": "Laurent Fabius, the Frenchman who brought down the gavel to seal the Paris Accord on climate change five years ago, said he wished world powers had fought global warming as resolutely as they have confronted the coronavirus pandemic. The agreement between almost 200 states on December 12, 2015 was hailed as a potential turning point in efforts to contain global warming. It called for holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. While the long-term trend in global temperatures is now downwards, progress is insufficient, Fabius said, blaming a lack of political will among many governments, not least the United States under President Donald Trump. However, in an interview with Reuters, he highlighted some positive developments, including President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s pledge to bring the United States back into the accord. Governments have taken courageous financial and social decisions to halt the virus, but climate change poses an even graver threat, Fabius said. \"Unfortunately, we are not doing as much to fight climate change as we are to tackle the fallout from COVID,\" said Fabius, who was chief negotiator at the Paris talks and is now president of France\u2019s Constitutional Council. He said it was critical that in the global recovery from the pandemic, the rebound is \"green\" and money is not ploughed into old, polluting industries. The accord has brought some success, Fabius said. Scientific models had projected temperatures would increase 5 or 6 degrees and now estimated rises of 3 to 4 degrees by 2100. But this was still too high, he said. The thresholds set by the Paris Accord reflect scientists\u2019 beliefs that a rise in temperatures of more than 2 degrees would doom the planet to a future of rising sea levels, catastrophic floods, droughts and storms, and food and water shortages. Fabius, a former prime minister who was France\u2019s foreign minister at the time of the accord, recalled sleepless nights during two weeks of intense negotiations. The accord almost fell apart at the last moment. He has a cherished replica of the green wooden hammer: cheers erupted and diplomats hugged as his gavel came down. \"Since then, it\u2019s not been the same. In particular there was the backtracking by US President Donald Trump, which was bad for America but more so the rest of the world,\" he said. The United States, the world\u2019s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, formally exited the accord on November 4, a day after Election Day, fulfilling a Trump promise to withdraw. \"A certain number of countries said to themselves: if the world\u2019s biggest power doesn\u2019t respect its commitments, why should we?\" Fabius continued. But he said there had been a geopolitical shift in recent months. Biden has promised to rejoin the accord, China has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2060 and Japan by 2050. Fabius predicted that Biden\u2019s task will not be easy, with control of the US Senate still up for grabs and energy lobby groups wielding huge influence in Washington. \"(But) to move things we need every country in the world to act, not just one county.\" Reuters \u00a0 \n \n \n            Copyright \u00a9 2022  Discovery New Zealand - All Rights Reserved\n        ", "article_name": "climate-change-should-be-fought-the-same-way-world-fought-covid-19-paris-accord-chief-negotiator.amp", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/12/climate-change-should-be-fought-the-same-way-world-fought-covid-19-paris-accord-chief-negotiator.amp.html", "date_published": "2020-12-11 07:01:03", "article_length": 3229, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:51.935639"}

The amount of energy that's warmed the world's oceans over the past 25 years is the same as if 3.6 billion atom-bombs were dropped into them. A new report has analysed more than half a century of ocean data - painting a picture of the trends of climate change. Summer's supposed to be an ideal time for a dip - but so far for much of the country, the water hasn't been so inviting. Beachgoers Newshub spoke to on Tuesday described the water as \"refreshingly cold\" and \"quite chilly\". And while it might not feel like it at the moment, the oceans are actually getting much warmer. An Advances in Atmospheric Sciences report published on Tuesday has found the world's oceans warmed four-and-a-half times faster between 1987 and 2019 than they did between 1955 and 1986. NIWA meteorologist Ben Noll says it's not surprising, but it's still concerning. \"The long-term trend is certainly not our friend at this point in time,\" says Noll. Not only was last year's ocean temperature the warmest ever - it was 0.075C higher than the average between 1981 and 2010. The report says the energy required to warm the world's water that much would be 228 sextillion joules of heat. The same rate as if five Hiroshima atomic bombs were dropped into the water every second over the past 25 years. Oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases. Fourteen international scientists examined data all the way back to the 1950s, using satellites as well as deploying thousands of Argo floats around the world. \"The oceans are a repository of the excess heat that is caused by global warming, and represent one of the best ways that we can measure climate change anywhere on the globe,\" says Noll.

It accounted for about 0.17 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions in 2014.\u00a0 But per capita, New Zealand was the 21st biggest contributor.\u00a0 \"Small countries don't get off the hook because collectively we add up to a greater total of emissions than the larger countries do,\" Shaw said.\u00a0 The minister's Zero Carbon Bill  passed into law  in November last year. It includes a net-zero emissions target by 2050 and a 24-47 percent reduction in biogenic methane below 2017 levels by 2050.\u00a0 There has been some debate about humankind's contribution to climate change and whether humans can realistically reverse the effects of a warming planet.\u00a0 National MP  Judith Collins is sceptical  and believes the \"likely impacts of climate change are being hugely overstated by the media and political left\".\u00a0 But a stark warning was issued in October 2018 in a report about global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations body made up of experts on the topic.\u00a0 It said if Earth warms by 2degC, hundreds of thousands of species could go extinct, natural environments will die and coastal communities will be flooded out of existence. The key finding was that meeting a 1.5degC target is possible but would require \"deep emissions reductions\" and \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\u00a0 New Zealand agreed to help keep global average temperatures below 2degC and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5degC, when it signed up to the Paris Agreement in 2015. Collins has said she doubts that goal can be met, saying despite New Zealand's best efforts, there is \"almost no chance\" the world will avoid reaching 1.5degC. The Government admits that emissions forecasts based on current policies show that New Zealand is not on track to meet this target. The IPCC report does say that global warming will likely rise to 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052 if warming continues to increase at the current rate. But some scientists are more optimistic. When the report came out, NIWA scientist Dr Jonny Williams said maintaining temperatures below 1.5degC will be \"challenging, but certainly not impossible\".", "headline": "James Shaw clashes with Sean Plunket over teaching climate change in schools", "article_name": "james-shaw-clashes-with-sean-plunket-over-teaching-climate-change-in-schools", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/james-shaw-clashes-with-sean-plunket-over-teaching-climate-change-in-schools.html", "date_published": "2020-01-13 18:05:40", "article_length": 5208, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:53.132561"}
{"id": null, "body": "\n Warmer temperatures may have caused the monster landslide which trimmed the top of Mt Cook in 1991, according to a Swiss study of slope failures on three continents.  On December 14 1991, 12 million cubic metres of Mt Cook/Aoraki - including 10m from its top - collapsed and roared down the ice fields of the east face. It lowered the mountain's height by 10m to 3754m.  A special issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A today, investigating the thrust of climate change on geological hazards, reported that snowy and icy slopes have been failing more frequently over the past couple of decades.  An international team of researchers led by Christian Huggel from the University of Zurich analysed weather patterns in the days and weeks before slope failures on three continents, and found that all the avalanches followed unusually warm periods that ended with sudden temperature drops.  The rock and ice which detached from the eastern face of Mt Cook and scoured the surface as it travelled 7.5km followed such a pattern, the researchers said.  In the week immediately before the avalanche, temperatures warmed to 14.4degC at the base of the detachment zone, then rapidly cooled to subfreezing temperatures.  Rapid thaws from short-term, unusually warm temperatures enhanced melting and water production, which reduced the strength of the rock; and the sudden refreezing blocked the movement of meltwater in the bedrock, causing destabilising pressure changes.  Similar slope failures were also observed on Mounts Steller and Miller in Alaska in 2008, as well as in two epic avalanches in the last five years on Monte Rosa in the Alps.  The researchers said that large slope failures will increase in high-mountain areas as the number of warm extreme events increase.  In another study, Nature science journal reported British scientists Bill McGuire, Paul Harrop and Kim Deeming, looked closely at an ancient collapse on Mount Etna in Sicily, concluding that it was likely triggered by a warm and wet period around 10,000 years ago.  The most prominent feature on Mount Etna, Valle del Bove, a natural amphitheatre over 1000 times larger than the Colosseum and bounded by kilometre-high cliffs was excavated from the eastern flank of the volcano in a catastrophic collapse 7500 years ago, when the surface was exposed to extraterrestrial cosmic rays and warmer and wetter weather.  These researchers said rain and meltwater from snow and ice on top of a volcano can interact with fresh magma, causing pressures to build within the pores of rocks, which destabilises slopes.  They predicted that the warmer and wetter conditions to come under climate change may increase potential for more collapses of volcanic slopes.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images Climate change is a \"huge threat\" to humanity and it is very important for governments to take action as quickly as possible, Italian physics Nobel prize winner Giorgio Parisi told reporters on Tuesday. \"I am very pleased to have this Nobel because it is a recognition of all the field I have been working in,\" Parisi added. Japanese-born American Syukuro Manabe, German Klaus Hasselmann and Parisi won the 2021 Nobel Prize for Physics on Tuesday for work that helps understand complex physical systems such as Earth's changing climate. Japanese-born American Syukuro Manabe, German Klaus Hasselmann and Italian Giorgio Parisi won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for work that helps understand complex physical systems such as Earth's changing climate. In a decision hailed by the UN weather agency as a sign of a consensus forming around man-made global warming, one half of the 10-million Swedish crown (US$1.15 million) prize goes in equal parts to Manabe, 90, and Hasselmann, 89, for modelling earth's climate and reliably predicting global warming. The other half goes to Parisi for discovering in the early 1980s \"hidden rules\" behind seemingly random movements and swirls in gases or liquids that can also be applied to aspects of neuroscience, machine learning and starling flight formations. \"Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann laid the foundation of our knowledge of the Earth's climate and how humanity influences it,\" the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement. \"Giorgio Parisi is rewarded for his revolutionary contributions to the theory of disordered materials and random processes.\" Hasselmann, who is at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, told Reuters from his home that he did not want to wake up from what he described as a beautiful dream. \"I am retired, you know, and have been a bit lazy lately. I am happy about the honour. The research continues,\" he said. The Academy said Manabe, who works at Princeton University in the United States, had laid the foundation in the 1960s for today's understanding of Earth's climate after moving to the United States from Japan to continue his research. Interviewed by US and Japanese journalists at his home, Manabe said he believed his award reflected the Academy's recognition of climate change, which he said will continue to intensify with more droughts, torrential rains, warming of land masses and melting of polar ice. \"Already, as you know, there are many phenomena showing climate change is happening,\" he said in Japanese. \"And I think that is the reason why the theme of climate change was selected for the award this time.\" Asked in English how he would address climate change sceptics, he smiled and replied, \"That problem is about a million times more difficult than understanding climate change. It is very mysterious to me.\" Hasselmann, the Academy said, had developed models about 10 years later that became instrumental in proving that mankind's carbon dioxide emissions cause rising temperatures in the atmosphere. Parisi, who dialled into the media briefing announcing the winners, was asked for his message to world leaders due to meet for UN climate change talks in Glasgow, Scotland, from October 31. \"I think it is very urgent that we take real and very strong decisions and we move at a very strong pace,\" said the 73-year-old Nobel laureate, who works at Sapienza University of Rome. Scientists have spent decades urging climate change action on an often reluctant society, Hasselmann said in a recording published on the Nobel Prize's website. \"It is just that people are not willing to accept the fact that they have to react now for something that will happen in a few years,\" he said. Work on  climate change  has been recognised by Nobel prizes before. Former US Vice President Al Gore and the UN climate panel received the Peace Prize in 2007 for galvanizing international action against global warming. William Nordhaus won one half of the 2018 Economics prize for integrating climate change into the Western economic growth model. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is also seen as a strong contender for this year's Peace Prize,  due to be announced from Oslo on Friday .\u00a0 \"Sceptics or deniers of scientific facts...are not so visible anymore and this climate science message has been heard,\" World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said of this year's award. Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week after Americans David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian won the prize for  medicine  on Monday for the  discovery of receptors in the skin that sense temperature and touch . The Nobel prizes were created in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901 with only a handful of interruptions, primarily due to the two world wars. Like last year, there will be no banquet in Stockholm because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

{"id": null, "body": "Watch: 2020 was the seventh hottest on record.  Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty 2020 was New Zealand's seventh-hottest year on record, a new report has revealed. The Annual Climate Summary, released on Tuesday by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), says the average temperature in 2020 was 13.24C - 0.63C above the average recorded between 1981 and 2010. Six months of the year had temperatures well above the norm, six about average and none below average. It's now been 47 months since New Zealand experienced a month of below average temperatures (January 2017).\u00a0 Six of the past eight years have been the hottest since records began in 1909, NIWA said, with two outliers from the late 1990s making the list.\u00a0 A graph provided by the forecaster shows just how frequent above-average temperatures are occurring - covering 1909 to the present day, it starts off blue with the odd anomalous light red stripe, before turning deep red in the last decade as the warming effect of climate change starts to bite. The warmest place overall was Leigh, a small community north of Auckland, which averaged 16.9C. Whangarei and Kaitaia, also in Northland, came in second on 16.6C. 2020 began with a cold snap which quickly gave way to a heatwave, with several locations setting record highs - Gisborne on January 31 recorded the hottest temperature of the year, a sweltering 38.2C (the country's fifth-hottest January temperature ever).\u00a0 The second-warmest temperatures were recorded in Napier (37.4C) and Wairoa (37.3C), both on February 2. Warm and dry conditions arrived in February and March as the country went into lockdown, causing water supply shortages in places like Auckland and Northland. Some regions had less than 10 percent of the rain they'd normally get.\u00a0 Blenheim went 64 days without significant rainfall between December 2019 and February 2021. Auckland managed 47 days between January and February, the longest on record.\u00a0 February was particularly warm, more than 1.2C above average.\u00a0 There was rain in the deep south however, with floods in Fiordland, Otago and Southland, and a cold snap hit the eastern coast of the South Island. The big dry continued into April, again affecting most of the country except the far south. \"Several locations in Wairarapa, coastal Marlborough and coastal North Canterbury received less than 5mm of rain for the entire month,\" NIWA said.\u00a0 Rain came in winter, but temperatures remained relatively warm - snow levels at 10-year lows and ski areas struggling to attract business, even as Kiwis unable to travel overseas looked to their own backyard for tourism opportunities. It was the fifth-warmest June on record, and sixth-warmest August. Timaru reached 25.1C on August 30, the fourth-warmest winter temperature anywhere in the country on record.\u00a0 The coldest snap came in September, helping out ski fields and sending daytime temperatures to zero in Southland and Otago. The year's coldest temperature was recorded on June 14 at Middlemarch in Otago - a chilly -12.3C.\u00a0 The heat came back in October and November, fanning wildfires and water shortages in some parts of the country and dousing others in heavy rain. Napier had 242mm of rain on November 9 - the second-wettest day on record. It ended the month with six times as much rain as usual. Waikato had 200 percent as much rain as normal, as did Hawke's Bay, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson and Tasman. The situation in the south flipped, with below-normal rainfall in much of Southland, Fiordland, and the southern half of the West Coast. Everywhere but Stewart Island dried up in December as summer arrived.\u00a0 Whakatane racked up the most sunny hours - 2704 - followed by Nelson (2632) and Marlborough (2603).\u00a0 \"Of the six main centres in 2020, Auckland was the warmest, Dunedin was the coolest, Wellington was the wettest, Christchurch was the driest, Tauranga was the sunniest and Dunedin was the least sunny,\" said NIWA.

It's like, 'climate is about everything'. OK - but your models aren't based on everything. Your models are based on a set number of variables. So that means you've reduced the variables - which are everything - to that set. \"Well how did you decide which set of variables to include in the equation, if it's about everything? That's not just a criticism, that's like, if it's about everything, your models aren't right.

Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a senior research associate at the University of New South Wales (NSW), said climate change is undoubtedly a driving force behind the severity of the current bushfire season - despite what Australia's leaders are saying. \"We can certainly say it has contributed to the length and severity of this fire season... we knew this was going to happen,\" Perkins-Kirkpatrick, who specialises in climate extremes, told  New Scientist. In 2008, a report commissioned by the Australian government concluded that from roughly 2020, the country's bushfire season would begin earlier and become more ferocious due to global warming.\u00a0 \"Recent projections of fire weather suggest that fire seasons will start earlier, end slightly later, and generally be more intense. This effect increases over time, but should be directly observable by 2020,\" says the  report , preserved by the National Library of Australia.

According to Andrew Watkins at Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, two large-scale climate events are also underpinning the extreme fires. Drought has been exacerbated by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which has pushed warm water away from Australia towards Africa. He also acknowledged the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which has driven hot, dry winds from Australia's inland desert towards its east coast, fanning the flames in the fire-ravaged south-eastern states of NSW and Victoria.\u00a0 It's believed more than 24 people have died and more than 2000 properties have been decimated. Roughly eight million hectares of land have been burned, and new estimates predict more than 1 billion mammals, birds and reptiles have perished in the fires. A number of endangered native species are feared to be extinct. Watkins told the  outlet  that the hot, dry conditions should ease by March or April due to shifts in the IOD and SAM patterns, but it's unclear when they will return.", "headline": "Australia bushfires: Govt report in 2008 predicted climate change would intensify wildfires in 2020", "article_name": "australia-bushfires-govt-report-in-2008-predicted-climate-change-would-intensify-wildfires-in-2020", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/01/australia-bushfires-govt-report-in-2008-predicted-climate-change-would-intensify-wildfires-in-2020.html", "date_published": "2020-01-09 15:11:18", "article_length": 2603, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:55.024624"}

Credits: Video - The AM Show; Image - Getty Images / NIWA Last month was officially  New Zealand's warmest June on record  - news that might set alarm bells ringing for the environmentally conscious. But an expert says climate change is not the only reason behind the milder temperatures this winter, with several other factors at play. Last week, a polar blast from the Antarctic sent temperatures plummeting as bone-chilling winds swept the nation, causing heavy snowfall in several areas. But the sudden cold snap had little impact on the higher-than-average temperatures that month, says Nava Fedaeff, a forecaster at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA). \"It was one of the warmest months of all months on record, just looking at the anomaly values,\" Fedaeff told The AM Show on Tuesday morning.\u00a0 When analysing anomalies - months that saw a deviation from the average temperatures expected at that time of year - experts determined that June was the 13th warmest month on record since 1909, Fedaeff said. It is only the 13th time since 1909 that a month recorded a temperature anomaly of more than 1.9C above average.\u00a0\u00a0 But this week will see a return to wintery weather, she added, with cool air set to swathe the west of the South Island on Tuesday before shifting to the north on Wednesday. The cold front will spell snow for the lower South Island, with rainfall also on the cards for a number of regions, particularly along the west coast. It's a dramatic departure from the abundance of northeasterlies last month - winds that played a key factor in the balmy beginning to the winter season.\u00a0 \"That was one of the key reasons why June was warmer - more northeasterly winds. We had high pressure to the east of us, so that drives that northeasterly flow. One of the drivers is we've had a pretty strong polar vortex - that sounds cold, but the polar vortex is winds that circumnavigate Antarctica, high up in the atmosphere,\" Fedaeff explained. \"They were locking a lot of that cold air in place, so there weren't a lot of cold southerly outbreaks we would typically associate with winter.\u00a0 \"That change at the end of June, when Mother Nature opened the fridge door - that's when we got that southerly blast.\" But Fedaeff says a number of factors contributed to last month becoming the warmest June on record, including the plethora of northeasterly winds and the polar vortex - meaning climate change isn't solely to blame. \"We already live in a warmer climate\u2026 We live in a climate change mold, you would say. It affects every single weather pattern. So yes, that is something that bumps us up, gives us the warmth, but that's not the only reason [sic],\" she told The AM Show. \"We had the northeasterlies, we had the strong polar vortex, we had some subtropical storms coming down that brought a lot of humid air, so [there was] a lot of warmth from a lot of different areas - but [climate change] is part of the puzzle, absolutely.\"\u00a0 According to NIWA , the nationwide average temperature last month was 2.0C above average. This is just the 13th occasion since 1909 that a month achieved an anomaly of more than 1.9C relative to the 1981-2010 average. Temperatures were above average (0.51-1.20C above average) or well above average (more than 1.20C) throughout the country, with 24 locations observing their warmest June on record.\u00a0 Although rainfall was above normal or well above normal for eastern parts of Northland, inland Bay of Plenty, eastern Waikato, Wairarapa, northern Canterbury, southeastern Otago and western Southland, rainfall was below average or well below average for parts of Central Otago, South and Mid Canterbury, Nelson, Tasman, inland Whanganui, Gisborne and eastern Bay of Plenty.\u00a0 \"June 2021 mean sea level air pressure was above normal to the east of Aotearoa New Zealand. This was associated with more northeasterly airflows than usual over the country,\" NIWA said in its  climate report for June . \"The prevalence of these airflows, occasional low-pressure systems that transported warm, humid air down from the subtropics, and ongoing background warming from climate change meant it was a very warm start to winter throughout the country.\"", "headline": "Weather: Climate change 'not the only reason' why New Zealand recorded warmest June on record - NIWA forecaster", "article_name": "weather-climate-change-not-the-only-reason-why-new-zealand-recorded-warmest-june-on-record-niwa-forecaster", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/07/weather-climate-change-not-the-only-reason-why-new-zealand-recorded-warmest-june-on-record-niwa-forecaster.html", "date_published": "2021-07-06 11:50:18", "article_length": 4265, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:55.170771"}

A new survey has suggested that New Zealanders' perception of the environment has changed over time. The Public Perceptions of New Zealand's Environment\u00a0 online survey \u00a0released by Lincoln University was completed by 2000 people and looked at what people think about the state of the environment. It indicated the number of people who viewed climate change as an issue for the nation almost doubled from since 2016. Professor Ken Hughly said he wasn't surprised. \"A substantial proportion of respondents chose climate change as their number one global issue, and even though it was only second as an issue for New Zealand, it has certainly increased hugely. People are aware of what is going on and it is now being reflected in those surveys,\" Professor Hughly said. Professor Hughly noted that for the 2019 survey, they had recieved their highest number of young people participating. He said he was surprised they seemed optimistic about New Zealand's environmental state. \"If you think of the climate change agenda which is being driven hard by young people, you would think they would have a more pessimistic view than those age thirty and over. It's an area that's fertile ground for research and something that we will follow up in our next survey,\" Professor Hughly said. The survey also indicated that M\u0101ori participants felt more negative towards the state of the environment than other ethnicities. Professor Hughly concluded based on research that M\u0101ori have a stronger connection to the land. \"M\u0101ori have been in Aotearoa for a long time, resources like fresh water, mahinga kai, and many other aspects of the natural environment are like bread and butter and so they attach incredible importance to these resources, they understand what's going on with those resources. This means they are probably more aware of the detrimental things that are occurring,\" Professor Hughly said. Professor Hughly was surprised that the number of people who were concerned about farmers impact on freshwater had dropped for the first time in two decades of surveys. However, water issues still remained the number one concern for most New Zealanders surveyed. \"It's front and center in people's minds and then they see that being translated into water resource development, the availability of water for swimming, fishing, for wildlife and the like,\" Professor Hughly said. The survey also indicated that while a majority of people have made changes in the home such as recycling, only around 30 percent of people participated in out of home environmental causes. Professor Hughly said the survey is used to influence policy change and he hoped that these results could bring a positive impact to the environmental space.

Credits: Video - Newshub Nation; Image - Getty Nuclear power isn't the answer to reducing carbon emissions for electricity generation, new research has found.\u00a0 Researchers from the UK looked at data from 123 countries over 25 years, and found countries with large nuclear energy generation capabilities don't have significantly lower emissions than those without. In poorer countries, having nuclear power was even linked with higher emissions.\u00a0 Instead, countries looking to lower their emissions should invest in renewables. \"The evidence clearly points to nuclear being the least effective of the two broad carbon emissions abatement strategies,\" said Benjamin K Sovacool, professor of energy policy at the University of Sussex, who led  the research. Energy production using nuclear power doesn't emit carbon, but mining the necessary resources can be energy intensive - perhaps creating emissions. The World Nuclear Association - which represents most of the world's nuclear energy firms - says with demand for electricity increasing, it will be essential.\u00a0 \"Concerted international efforts over the past 20 years have increased the amount of electricity generated by wind, solar and other renewable sources, but have failed to displace fossil fuels from the mix,\"  its site reads . \"In order to achieve the deep decarbonisation required to keep the average rise in global temperatures to below 1.5C, combating climate change would be much harder, without an increased role for nuclear.\" But  the study , using data sourced from the World Bank and International Energy Agency, found nuclear programmes don't mix well with renewables.\u00a0 \"Nuclear and renewables tend to exhibit lock-ins and path dependencies that crowd each other out, identifying a number of ways in which a combined nuclear and renewable energy mix is incompatible,\" the authors said. \"These include the configuration of electricity transmission and distribution systems where a grid structure optimised for larger-scale centralized power production such as conventional nuclear, will make it more challenging, time-consuming and costly to introduce small-scale distributed renewable power. \"Similarly, finance markets, regulatory institutions and employment practices structured around large-scale, base-load, long-lead time construction projects for centralised thermal generating plants are not well designed to also facilitate a multiplicity of much smaller short-term distributed initiatives.\" Dr Sovacol's colleague and co-author Andy Stirling, professor of science and technology policy, said nuclear energy doesn't appear to be the saviour its backers say it is.\u00a0 \"Our findings show not only that nuclear investments around the world tend on balance to be less effective than renewable investments at carbon emissions mitigation, but that tensions between these two strategies can further erode the effectiveness of averting climate disruption.\" New Zealand  investigated the possibility of nuclear energy in the 1960s and 1970s . At one stage a nuclear reactor was mooted for Northland's Kaipara Harbour, but the discovery of the Maui gas fields put it on ice. A royal commission in the late 1970s suggested we'd need nuclear power by 2005, but New Zealand turned against all things nuclear in the 1980s. The share of electricity produced by renewables in New Zealand has increased in recent years, from 64 percent in 2008 to 82 percent now. The Government has a goal of 100 percent by 2035.\u00a0 The total energy burden however still falls largely on fossil fuels - only 40 percent of our total energy production is renewable, mostly thanks to transport. None of New Zealand's mainstream political parties are proposing New Zealand build nuclear power plants, even though  the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act doesn't actually ban it .

While most research to date on the economic impacts of rising temperatures has focused on impacts to particular industries, scientists at the University of Arizona took a \"top-down\" approach, looking instead at the relationship between temperatures and a country or region's economic output. \"Combining the latest physical climate models, socioeconomic projections and economic estimates of past impacts, we find that future warming could raise the expected rate of economic growth in richer countries, reduce the expected rate of economic growth in poorer countries, and increase the variability of growth by increasing the climate's variability,\" Derek Lemoine and Sarah Kapnick write in the latest issue of Nature Climate Change.

While COVID-19 lockdowns have led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, sea levels continue to rise, impacting communities such as Fairbourne, a village barely above sea level. The village is protected by a sea wall, earth banks and a network of drainage channels, but the defences are only set to last so long. No money will be spent on defending the Fairbourne community - consisting of around 400 homes and 850 people - after 2054.\u00a0 By 2054, Gwynedd Council says the \"risk to residents will significantly increase\" due to rising sea levels and changing weather patterns,  WalesOnline  reported.

In 2013, the Gwynedd council - the local governing body of Fairbourne - decided it could not afford to defend Fairbourne from the long-term effects of climate change. Long-time resident Stuart Eves says the local banks are refusing to hand out money, meaning residents can't get mortgages or buy houses.

About 200 New Zealand scientists are among the 11,258 who signed the declaration, which draws on 40 years of data measuring energy use, surface temperature, population growth, land clearing, deforestation, polar ice mass, fertility rates, gross domestic product and carbon emissions.\u00a0 It was in 1979 world leaders met for the First World Climate Conference in Geneva, but since then every environmental indicator has gotten markedly worse (with the exception of fertility rates, which continue to decline - albeit more slowly than they used to).\u00a0 \"Scientists have a moral obligation to warn humanity of any great threat,\" said the University of Sydney's Thomas Newsome, who co-authored the declaration. \"From the data we have, it is clear we are facing a climate emergency.\" Data shows since the first World Climate Conference, the population of the world has gone from 4.3 to 7.5 billion; livestock herds and meat consumption per capita have both gone up about 50 percent; energy consumption - including fossil fuels - has continued to rise, as have air travel, deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. The result has been rising temperatures, sea levels and ocean acidity, shrinking ice sheets and more frequent extreme weather events.\u00a0 \"Despite 40 years of major global negotiations, we have generally conducted business as usual and are essentially failing to address this crisis,\" said co-lead author of the paper, Oregon State University College of Forestry ecology professor William Ripple. \"Climate change has arrived and is accelerating faster than many scientists expected.\" Dr Newsome said all is not lost however, \"as long as the world takes \"immediate steps\" to rectify the problems. \"We are encouraged by a recent surge of concern,\" the paper says. \"Governmental bodies are  making climate emergency declarations .

This has the potential to reduce the short-term warming trend by more than 50 percent over the next few decades.\" New Zealand is a big contributor to methane emissions due to our significant agricultural industry. Farmers have  long resisted being included in any formal efforts to reduce emissions , saying that would severely damage the economy. The industry has been exempt since the establishment of the Emissions Trading Scheme in 2008. \"Restrain massive land clearing. Restore and protect ecosystems such as forests, grasslands and mangroves, which would greatly contribute to the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas.\" While deforestaton of the Amazon is proceeding more slowly than it 15 or 20 years ago there has been  a recent uptick , with critics blaming Brazil's new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who earned the nickname 'Captain Chainsaw' for his indifference to the plight of the world's biggest rainforest.\u00a0 \"Eat mostly plants and consume fewer animal products. This dietary shift would significantly reduce emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases and free up agricultural lands for growing human food rather than livestock feed. Reducing food waste is also critical.\" Another area which New Zealand excels at is producing meat, and the industry has  fought long and hard against a growing shift towards veganism and vegetarianism .\u00a0 \"Convert the economy's reliance on carbon fuels to address human dependence on the biosphere. Shift goals away from the growth of gross domestic product and the pursuit of affluence. Curtail the extraction of materials and exploitation of ecosystems to maintain long-term biosphere sustainability.\" New Zealand last year enacted a  near-complete ban on new oil and gas exploration permits , but is allowing companies with existing permits to keep looking for new sources of fossil fuels.

National's ETS kicks in on July 1, when the energy and industrial industries will have to start paying for the right to pollute. Costs will likely be passed onto consumers. Agriculture, currently exempt, will come into the scheme in 2015. Next week's protest aims to put a stop to the scheme. \"The ETS will cause a lot of undue hardship to New Zealanders, and not have any measurable benefit to the climate,\" says protest organiser and East Cape farmer Esther Henderson. Ms Henderson and her partner Neil are the founders of  Climate Realists , a lobby group that argues manmade climate change is a myth. Protesters will gather at the Civic Centre at 12pm before marching to Parliament at 12:30pm, where Ms Henderson says they will hand over a card to \"whichever Government minister we can persuade to meet us\". She is not sure how many people will turn up, but hopes it will be enough to persuade a rethink of the scheme. \"We have no idea. We will know on the day. We've had a lot of interest.\" Prime Minister John Key said last month the total cost to households of the ETS would be a \"modest\" $3 a week, or around $267 million a year. Climate Realists say the true cost will be closer to $527 million \"based on fuel and electricity costs and flow-on effects\". The figure was supplied by Federated Farmers.  The Government's official estimate, included in the Budget, is $378 million. \"The trouble with the figures is that they change all the time,\" says Ms Henderson. Federated Farmers wants agriculture's entry into the ETS  delayed until 2043 , by which time many environmentalists believe it would be too late to prevent global warming. That is, if global warming is even happening \u2013 Ms Henderson isn't so sure. \"We certainly believe the climate is changing, has always changed and will continue to change,\" says Ms Henderson, who admits she has no scientific qualifications beyond \"high school chemistry\".  She says the recent few decades of warming are \"not out of the ordinary\", and now, \"temperatures if anything are slightly cooling\". A  statistical study commissioned by the Associated Press  last year found no evidence of global cooling since 1998, the year commonly cited as the turning point by climate change sceptics. \u00a0 Whatever the direction the world's climate is headed in, Ms Henderson says natural forces are to blame, not carbon emissions. \"I assume Greenland was called Greenland because it was once green,\" she says.

The Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC) suggested that farming be included in the ETS, however sector leaders want a voluntary agreement with the Government instead. The letter to Arden has been signed by Chief Executives of DairyNZ, Beef + Lamb New Zealand and the Meat Industry Association. \u00a0\"We're writing to you on behalf of sheep, beef and dairy farmers and the countless rural communities across New Zealand who are  doing their best to be responsible stewards of the land ,\" said Tim Mackle, Sam McIvor and Tim Ritchie. \"We are incredibly proud of  the environmental improvements  that have been made by successive generations of farmers. Like you, we also want future generations to continue to benefit from and enjoy the environment we have today.\" The letter said farming groups had looked to work constructively with the Government over the past few months to help drive the best possible outcome on climate change for the country. \"That's why DairyNZ, Beef + Lamb New Zealand, the Meat Industry Association and eight other primary sector organisations developed He Waka Eke Noa, the Primary Sector Climate Change Commitment as a collaborative proposal with Government and Maori to help us achieve a low-carbon future.\" It urges the Prime Minister to support the initiative which it describes as \"an innovative and world-leading statement from the primary sector.\" \"We believe this will be more effective than taxing the sector via a levy on processors through the  Emissions Trading Scheme. \" Arden has acknowledged previously there had been significant debate around agriculture and its contribution to emissions in New Zealand. \"It's a  significant part of our export industries , a significant part of our economy and with these emissions, they are ones that are very difficult to control, it's part of the natural processes, and that's probably why it's been contentious,\" she said.\u00a0 However she said they made up a huge part of New Zealand's emissions profile. \"If we are going to take action on climate change ultimately we have to find a way to reduce emissions from agriculture, and with technological research and development there are ways we can do that, including with farming practice,\" said Arden.

It's the plan to abandon properties most at risk of climate change. But some residents say they've been left out of that conversation. In a bid to save Lower Hutt from flooding, more than 100 riverside properties will be sacrificed. They were bought by the council to be demolished, to make way for a bigger stop-bank. For those living in these homes, the future's uncertain. \"People are on the street already, where are all of us going to go?\" says Pharazyn Street resident Kerry Williams. The 'managed retreat' is part of the Hutt City Council's plan to mitigate flood risk. It's a concept many flood-prone communities are grappling with - but a concept Williams says they haven't been consulted on. \"We're going to lose our homes, as well as all the flats down the street, with hundreds of people.

Greater Wellington Regional Council flood management committee chair Prue Lamason says the regional council is a responsible landlord, which has kept tenants informed of its plan. \"There is no way we're going to knock on their door and say 'sorry, you're out of here tomorrow'.\" Experts say authorities need to find a better way to allay fears of devalued assets or possible homelessness as a result of managed retreat. \"The word that gets heard most is retreat, not managed. That's because no-one has actually thought through what managed retreat is,\" NIWA chief climate scientist Andrew Tait. But Tait says it's also important not to impose the concept on communities.

The team, funded by the Marsden Fund, has designed a cutting-edge device to measure the temperature of supercooled ocean water under sea ice. The collaboration with Norwegian and US scientists has resulted in a High Precision Supercooling Measurement Instrument (HiPSMI) that's sent under the ice on the Icefin, a small, remotely-operated submersible robot to take temperature measurements. But before getting to the ice of Antarctica, the team had to spend two weeks in isolation at a lodge in Methven. While there they used the wheelie bin of ice and the lodge's pool to test HiPSMI, and made some technical improvements to it before their Antarctic excursion. Sea ice usually freezes at -1.9 degrees Celsius, but not when fresh water flows beneath the ice shelf and mixes with the salty sea water, said Dr Inga Smith from the University of Otago. \"Then it becomes what's called supercooled, so it's still liquid but actually below the freezing point. It then snap freezes into crystals called frazil, they attach to the sea ice and form platelet ice,\" Smith said. \"We're really pushing the edge of polar engineering here, operating in these really cold temperatures and making high-precision measurements of that supercooling,\" she said. The knowledge gained from accurate measurements of water temperature can help with both climate change modeling as well as weather prediction, said Maren Richter, a PhD student from the University of Otago. \"We know more about the dark side of the moon than we know about what's going on underneath the Ross Ice Shelf,\" she said. \"These measurements help to inform understanding of how the system that is the ocean, the ice and the atmosphere works together, and how that all interconnects. \"These are all calculated by large scale models and the more accurate we can make these models, even on really small scales like this, the more accurate it will be on larger scales like informing weather in the future in New Zealand,\" she said. Once the team got to Antarctica, they worked out of an ice camp on McMurdo Sound owned by NIWA. Sarah Williamson, chief executive of Antarctica New Zealand, said the camp was key to the success of the team. \"They managed to collect oceanographic and sea ice data for 17 of the 20 days at the ice camp, and\u00a0 HiPSMI data on eight of those days,\" she said. \"It's always satisfying when we can support this world-leading science so successfully in Antarctica, particularly when it has such important ramifications for the rest of the planet.\"", "headline": "Kiwi-led Antarctic HiPSMI project hoped to help with climate change understanding", "article_name": "kiwi-led-antarctic-hipsmi-project-hoped-to-help-with-climate-change-understanding", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/technology/2022/01/kiwi-led-antarctic-hipsmi-project-hoped-to-help-with-climate-change-understanding.html", "date_published": "2022-01-17 10:57:44", "article_length": 2875, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:59.487154"}

{"id": null, "body": "Earth's average global warming must stay below 1.5degC if we want to avoid catastrophic environmental damage, a new report says. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s  special report 'Global Warming of 1.5degC'  warns that we need to take unprecedented action to ensure the planet's warming stays manageable. The report says if Earth warms by 2degC, hundreds of thousands of species could go extinct, natural environments will die and coastal communities will be flooded out of existence. Former IPCC lead author Dr Jim Salinger says it's the most significant climate report to date. \n \"The difference between the impacts of 1.5degC and 2.0degC is earth-shattering. For example, coral reefs would decline by 70 - 90 percent with global warming of 1.5degC, whereas virtually all (>99 percent) would be lost with 2degC. \"Species loss and extinction are projected to be significantly lower at 1.5degC of global warming compared to 2degC.\" If global warming continues to increase at the current rate, it's predicted to reach 1.5degC between 2030 and 2052. At that temperature, many species are at risk of extinction - but if the global average temperature rises by another half a degree, about 400,000 species could die out. The report says global temperatures have already risen by 1degC higher than average warming increases prior to industrialisation. Earth is now warming at about 0.2degC per decade, which lead report author Associate Professor Bronwyn Hayward from the University of Canterbury says could have a massive impact. \"This doesn't sound like much but if we carry on like this, effectively the world will be warmed 50 percent more that it has already experienced, between 2040 and 2050, and some regions will feel the effects of these changes even more severely and quickly. She says the findings \"mark the end of 'magical thinking' about climate change\". \"The report is unequivocal, our climate is changing now,\" she says. \"Without unprecedented cuts to emissions now, we will have fewer opportunities to develop sustainably and will be required to rely increasingly on unproven, risky and possibly socially undesirable technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere in the future.\" Professor Hayward says the report is groundbreaking because it places climate change within a social context and asks how humanity can make urgent changes to limit its devastation. \"But to avoid climate warming above 1.5C, we have to scale up action in unprecedented ways across all sectors of our economy and everyday life, over the next 10 years.\" David Tong from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says the report's release is a landmark moment that shows humans have the power to prevent the disastrous effects of climate change. The report says human activity is estimated to have caused about 1degC of global warming above pre-industrial levels. Mr Tong says the findings have particular significance for islands like Kiribati. \"The difference between 1.5degC and 2degC is huge. For our Pacific neighbours, it's an existential difference.\" Professor Hayward says a future warmer than 1.5degC will put New Zealand's own coastal communities in jeopardy, providing us with another reason to avoid it. \"If the world's temperatures remain at or below 1.5C the report suggests we could avoid an additional 10 cm of sea level rise on average, over and above the trajectories we are already committed to by 2100.\" The report also has enormous repercussions for icy land masses like Antarctica and Greenland, as warming of 1.5degC to 2degC could trigger rapid melting and sea level rises. Mr Tong says he's confident New Zealand can work to keep warming below the temperature danger zone. \"This is a challenge but New Zealanders have a history of doing incredible things in the face of big global challenges. By acting now, our businesses, communities and every single one of us can reap the benefits of being a first mover in the switch to a new clean energy economy.\" Professor James Renwick from Victoria University of Wellington says the report makes for \"sobering reading\". \"We are currently living with 1degC of global warming and we're seeing effects already in extreme events and impacts on ecosystems and societies worldwide. \"More warming, even half a degree, means more and bigger impacts, but it is clear that a 1.5degC world would be a lot more manageable and recognisable than a 2degC world.\" He says while it's physically possible to prevent warming from increasing above 1.5degC, it would require \"huge political and social commitment\" from every country on Earth. \"The world would need to reach zero carbon by 2050, with a 50 percent reduction between now and 2030. Given the past trajectory of global emissions of greenhouse gases (nearly a doubling in the past 30 years), this represents a truly heroic and unprecedented effort to turn the global economy around. Are the governments, the businesses, and the people of the world up to it?\" Lobby group Coal Action Network says the findings \"should be ringing in the ears\" of Climate Change Minister James Shaw as he negotiates the Zero Carbon Act with the Opposition. \"He cannot cave to special interests over science,\" says spokesperson Cindy Baxter. \"This report should bolster his case for strong and early action.\" Greenpeace hopes the report will \"shock the world\" into immediate action. \"We have 10 years to save the world as we know it,\" says climate and energy campaigner, Amanda Larsson. \"This really is our last chance to avoid catastrophic climate change, the effects of which will be felt in our lifetime. We need to pull out all the stops to fast-track clean energy, especially solar, and to clean up our dairy industry through a transition to regenerative farming. We have to act now, and very quickly.\" She says New Zealand's new ban on oil and gas permits mean we're emerging as a global climate leader and we must keep up the good work. \"As a small nation, our biggest impact is in showing the world that immediate and dramatic action is not only possible, but it's achievable.\" Newshub.", "headline": "'Earth-shattering' new climate report reveals 2degC danger zone", "article_name": "earth-shattering-new-climate-report-reveals-2degc-danger-zone", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/10/earth-shattering-new-climate-report-reveals-2degc-danger-zone.html", "date_published": "2018-10-08 14:22:05", "article_length": 6080, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:44:59.883815"}

Credits: Video - The AM Show; Image - Getty YouTube users interested in climate issues are just as likely to be directed to conspiracy theories as they are scientific content,  new research  has found. And the Google-owned site's efforts to crack down on fake content appears to be struggling, with subscriber counts to channels promoting debunked nonsense still growing. Researchers in Germany took a look at what YouTube had to offer when it came to climate science, and were disturbed by what they found. \"Searching YouTube for climate-science and climate-engineering-related terms finds fewer than half of the videos represent mainstream scientific views,\" said Joachim Allgaier, sociologist at RWTH Aachen University. \"It's alarming to find that the majority of videos propagate conspiracy theories about climate science and technology.\" About 54 percent of the clips YouTube served up at the top of the search rankings for terms like 'climate engineering', 'global warming' and climate modification' bucked the scientific consensus, which is that humans are the cause of an unprecedented spike in greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures. The worst offender was the search term 'chemtrails'. Only 5 percent of clips presented the scientific consensus, and they weren't popular, only garnering 1.5 percent of views. Conspiracy videos accounted for 95 of videos and 98.5 percent of views. Dr Allgaier said what was most worrying is that conspiracy theorists have learned to present their claims in scientific language so it's not immediately clear the claims have no basis in reality. \"People searching for 'geoengineering' or 'climate modification' on YouTube won't find any information on these topics in the way they are discussed by scientists and engineers. Instead, searching for these terms results in videos that leave users exposed to entirely non-scientific video content.\" YouTube earlier this year announced plans to  cut down the number of conspiracy theory videos  it recommended to its 2 billion users. \"We'll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways,\" the site said in a blog post in January, \"such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the Earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.\" But  a new investigation by The Huffington Post  has found the change has had little impact on major purveyors of such nonsense. Tech reporter Jesselyn Cook analysed several channels and found while it appears to be preventing new channels from breaking through to a wider audience, subscriber counts are still growing for YouTubers who already had a big following before the change. \"If a creator has already started to grow an audience, that audience will seek out their content whether it\u2019s going up in the algorithm or not,\" data researcher Becca Lewis told Cook. In many cases, this change is too little, too late.\" Dr Allgaier said YouTube needs to \"take responsibility to ensure its users will find high-quality information if they search for scientific and biomedical terms, instead of being exposed to doubtful conspiracy videos\". \"YouTube has an enormous reach as an information channel, and some of the popular science YouTubers are doing an excellent job at communicating complex subjects and reaching new audiences.\u00a0 \"Scientists could form alliances with science-communicators, politicians and those in popular culture in order to reach out to the widest possible audience. They should speak out publicly about their research and be transparent in order to keep established trustful relationships with citizens and society.\" Dr Allgaier's findings were released the same day  two new studies detailed how climate change sceptics have misused historic climate data  to claim the recent upswing in temperatures has nothing to do with humans.

I am so over the nonsense that is being propagated by politicians and policymakers about this thing that is now just referred to as \"climate change.\" Every day it is being foisted upon us. The world is in crisis. There is going to be a disaster, a catastrophe. The world is going to end. We have 12 years. We have 10 years. Some nutbag appeared on The AM Show yesterday saying it will end in seven years. Prince Charles says we have 18 months left before it is irreversible and the world will end. Why do we allow people to get away with this? Why is there absolutely no debate that these prophets of gloom may possibly be wrong? Why is it that not just Stuff, but it seems all media in this country refuse to allow even a skerrick of evidence that CO2 may not be the cause of the earth's warming? Those of us who ask questions, and do not accept what we are having forced upon us, are now being called deniers. Note the phrasing, the use of language. As if words like catastrophe and crisis and emergency were not enough, those who are skeptical are now being called \"deniers.\" The last group of people to be called deniers were those who believe the holocaust didn't happen. The thing is, we know the holocaust happened. We have physical evidence of graves, of concentration camps, of gas chambers and of people being loaded onto trains to go there and never be seen again. How can people who ask questions about the changing climate and whether CO2 and other gases in the atmosphere be called \"deniers?\" The arrogance in the putdown is breathtaking. Why are people not allowed to ask questions? Why are people not allowed to make observations about what they see in front of them outside every day? Why are we not allowed to ask about all those other predictions of 30 years ago which have not come true? Why am I so worked up about this? I'll tell you why. We are being fed BS by our politicians, politicians from both parties who refuse to ask questions? Politicians and policymakers who use the phrase \" the science is settled.\" \n Science can never be settled. How can science be settled? It's like technology. Once we thought black and white TV was just marvelous. Then we went to colour, then to digital. The technology is always evolving. It's just like science. Scientists are still working towards a cure for cancer, a cure for diabetes. They haven't found the answer yet. It's the same with weather and climate. How come the earth in the last 2000 years has been through multiple warming and cooling periods? And remember the last 2000 years are just a blip on the length of time the solar system and planet earth has been in existence.\u00a0 That ridiculous interactive front of website piece on Stuff this morning tells us breathlessly that we have more CO2 in the atmosphere now than at any stage in the last 3 million years. Wow - do you know how long this planet is estimated to have been in existence? 4.5 billion years. This is a piece that has a picture of a church surrounded by floodwaters as it's front page. Once again using emotive visuals of what was probably a quite natural event to propagate panic when rational thinking people will not panic, but instead, observe their surroundings, and ask questions. Like, why is Greenland called Greenland? Because about a thousand years ago it was home to a population of Vikings who lived and thrived there in a climate that allowed food to grow and animals to be farmed. It was the era known as medieval warming. Then the Little Ice age came along and wiped that population out. That little ice age ended in the first half of the 19th century. Since then the earth has been getting warmer.\u00a0 Now in this age of instant information, there is a lot of information available online which presents a different view of the world's climate. \n The James Shaws of this world will say these people are climate change deniers? We found this on a website called IZZit.org. It's an educational website, offering videos, lesson plans, and other teaching resources. It claims to have 18 million students, 195 thousand teachers and 44,000 schools as its clients. It has been criticised as offering \"an unabashed ode to free-market capitalism and private property\" .. as if that was a bad thing. But that's how your modern-day teacher tends to think. Can't have that capitalism thing. Some people might have more money than others. Anyway, I digress. This video asks questions. It challenges what has become the propagated modern-day story of CO2 induced climate change. It asks whether the sun could be the major player in the way the world's climate has changed and continues to change. The video is narrated by an identified teenage student, and features comments from Dr David Legates, from the Center for Climate Research at the University of Delaware and Doctor Willie Soon, an astrophysicist at Harvard Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics. Watch\u00a0 this \u00a0and then ask - why are James Shaw and Julie Ann Genter and almost our entire Parliament doing what they are doing? To follow that up, David Legates and Willie Soon are favourite targets of the High priests and clergy of the climate change religion.

Taking immediate action on climate change will save New Zealand billions of dollars in the long run, according to a new study.

{"id": null, "body": "David Hall for The Conversation OPINION: Back in pre-COVID times last year, when New Zealand passed the Zero Carbon Act, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern insisted \"New Zealand will not be a slow follower\" on climate change. It struck a clear contrast with the previous National government's approach, which the then prime minister, John Key, often described as being \"a fast follower, not a leader\". He had lifted this language from the New Zealand Institute's 2007 report, which argued against \"lofty rhetoric about saving the planet or being a world leader\". Instead, it counselled New Zealand to respond without \"investing unnecessarily in leading the way\". Key was eventually accused of failing to live up to even this unambitious ideal \u2014 New Zealand came to be known as a climate laggard. With her hand on the nation's rudder since 2017, has Ardern done any better? Is New Zealand a climate leader, and not merely a symbolic leader on the international speaking circuit but a substantive leader that sets examples for other countries to follow? On my analysis of Ardern's government, New Zealand is now, finally, a fast follower. The government's climate policy is best evaluated from three perspectives: the domestic, international and moral. From a domestic perspective, where a government is judged against the governments that preceded it, Ardern is entitled to declare (as she did when the Zero Carbon Act was passed) that: \"We have done more in 24 months than any government in New Zealand has ever done on climate action.\" But at the international level, where New Zealand is judged against the actions of other countries and its international commitments, it is more a fast follower than a leader, defined by policy uptake and international advocacy rather than innovation. At the moral level, where New Zealand is judged against objectives such as the 1.5C carbon budget, its actions remain inadequate. A recent report by Oxfam notes New Zealand is off-track for its international obligations. The nation's record looks even worse when we factor in historical responsibilities. From this perspective, New Zealand, like other countries in the global north, is acting with an immoral lack of haste. It is for the next government to go from being merely transitional to truly transformational. The formation of the Ardern government in 2017 inaugurated a phase of rapid policy development, drawing especially from UK and EU examples. But the evidence of substantive climate leadership is much less clear. The government's most prominent achievement is the Zero Carbon Act, which passed through parliament with cross-party support in November 2019. This establishes a regulatory architecture to support the low-emissions transition through five-yearly carbon budgets and a Climate Change Commission that provides independent advice. Its other major achievement, less heralded and more disputed, was the suspension of offshore oil and gas permits. This supply-side intervention is surely Ardern's riskiest manoeuvre as prime minister, not only on climate but on any policy issue. It stands as an exception to her careful, incremental style. It signalled that the Crown's historical indulgence of the oil and gas sector was coming to an end. But both policies involve followership. The Zero Carbon Act is closely modelled on the UK's Climate Change Act 2008 and the leadership came from outside government. It was initially championed by the youth group Generation Zero. The independent Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment then picked it up. Similarly, the offshore oil and gas ban builds upon longstanding activism from M\u0101ori organisations and activists. In 2012, Petrobras withdrew prematurely from a five-year exploration permit after resistance from East Cape iwi (tribe) Te Wh\u0101nau-\u0101-Apanui. New Zealand was also only following in the footsteps of more comprehensive moratoriums elsewhere, such as Costa Rica in 2011 and France in 2017. There are many other climate-related policies, including: Only the last policy is a world first. Even then, private companies throughout the world are already adopting this approach without a mandate from government. In all likelihood, New Zealand's greatest claim to pioneering policy is its decision to split targets for carbon dioxide and methane in the Zero Carbon Act, which means agricultural methane is treated separately. If the science behind this decision eventually informs the international accounting of greenhouse gases, it will have major ramifications for developing countries whose economies also rely heavily on agriculture. Not all proposed policies made it through the political brambles of coalition government. Most conspicuously, commitments to an emissions-free government vehicle fleet, the introduction of fuel-efficiency standards, and feebates for light vehicles were all thwarted. This is symptomatic of this government's major weakness on climate. Its emphasis on institutional reforms rather than specific projects will yield long-term impacts, but not produce the immediate emissions reductions to achieve New Zealand's 2030 international target under the Paris Agreement. This is where a future government can make the rhetoric of climate leadership a reality.

Human-induced climate change has been linked to  rising global temperatures , the  loss of ice sheets , the  devastation of Australia's Great Barrier Reef , the  freakish mating of two different bear species  and now, the disappearance of an entire species. The only known population of the Bramble Cay melomys, which lived in Queensland, Australia have now disappeared, scientists say. An extensive survey of the species was carried out between August and September 2014 after a smaller survey in March couldn't find any of the rodents. More than 900 traps were used in the survey along with 60 camera traps. No record of the species could be found. It's believed the last time the Bramble Cay melomys was spotted was in 2009. The report , led by Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection's (DEHP) Ian Gynther, is pointing the finger at human-induced climate change. Rising sea levels have swamped the cay, which typically live close to water, claiming the small rodents' habitat and potentially even their lives. \"Significantly, this probably represents the first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change,\" the report concludes. But all hope may not be lost -- there's speculation the population of the Bramble Cay melomys were from Papua New Guinea's Fly River delta. It means the species, or a closely-related one, may rise again. \"Consequently, at this stage, it may be premature to declare the Bramble Cay melomys extinct on a global scale,\" the report says. The report still recommends the species is officially reclassified from endangered to extinct within the Commonwealth and work to do so is currently underway. While there's still a possibility the species may remain in the Fly River region, for the mammal's population in Queensland, they're giving up. \"Because the Bramble Cay melomys is now confirmed to have been lost from Bramble Cay, no recovery actions for this population can be implemented,\" Queensland's DEHP says.

{"id": null, "body": "By Michael P Cameron for The Conversation Population growth plays a  role  in environmental damage and climate change. But addressing climate change through either reducing or reversing growth in population raises difficult moral questions that most people would prefer to avoid having to answer. The English political economist  Thomas Robert Malthus  laid out a compelling argument against overpopulation in his famous 1798 book,  An Essay on the Principle of Population . He argued that increases in food production improved human wellbeing only temporarily. The population would respond to greater wellbeing by having more children, increasing population growth and eventually over-running the food supply, leading to famine. But his essay could not have been timed worse, coming near the beginning of the longest period of sustained global population growth in history. This was driven in part by vast  improvements in agricultural productivity  over time. This idea of hard environmental limits to population growth was resurrected in the 20th century in publications such as  The Population Bomb , a 1968 book by Stanford biologist  Paul Ehrlich , and  The Limits to Growth , a 1972 publication commissioned by the  Club of Rome  think-tank. The implication of these treatises on the perils of population growth suggest population control is an important measure to limit carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) emissions and global climate change. Population growth is not the only driver of global CO\u2082 emissions and climate change. The  Kaya identity , an equation introduced by the Japanese energy economist Yoichi Kaya in the 1990s, relates the total emissions of CO\u2082 to four factors: total population GDP per person energy use per unit of GDP CO\u2082 emissions per unit of energy. CO\u2082 emissions can be addressed by reducing any one (or more) of those four factors, provided the other factors are not growing even faster than those reductions. Not all of the factors are equally easy to affect though. That explains why to date, most countries have concentrated on reducing energy intensity (such as with home insulation to increase the efficiency of energy consumption) and reducing carbon intensity (such as with wind and solar as greener energy production methods). But the rate of progress in slowing global CO\u2082 emissions has not been sufficient as yet to achieve  agreed targets . Many people have argued we should target lower economic growth to curb environmental damage. Globally, the trend is for GDP per person to increase generally over time. Reducing this growth, or moving into managed economic decline, would contribute to reducing CO\u2082 emissions. But achieving reductions in CO\u2082 emissions through reducing economic growth comes with unavoidable distributional consequences, both within and between countries. Not all countries have shared equally in past economic growth. Low-income countries could persuasively argue it is unfair for their current low level of development to be locked in by reducing their ability to continue to grow their economies. That leaves population control, but the issues here are no less challenging. Government-led population control presents serious moral questions for democratic countries. That\u2019s why the only country to have undertaken a (moderately) successful form of population control is China, through the  One Child Policy  that ran from 1979 to 2015. Over that period, the total fertility rate in China  roughly halved . But an unintended consequence of the policy is an accelerated rate of  population ageing in China , which now has one of the oldest populations in Asia. The most challenging aspect of using population control to reduce CO\u2082 emissions is ethical. If our concern about climate change arises because we want to ensure a liveable future world for our grandchildren, is it ethical to ensure that pathway is achieved by preventing some grandchildren from ever seeing that world because they are never born? That is a very difficult question to answer. Public policy initiatives to control population growth are probably not even necessary. All high-income countries currently already have  below-replacement fertility , with fewer children being born than are necessary to maintain a constant population. In the year to June 2020, New Zealand experienced its  lowest total fertility rate ever , with 1.63 births per woman (replacement fertility needs at least 2.1 births per woman). Other countries are also  seeing their populations decreasing . For example, the population of Japan peaked in 2010 and has  declined by more than 1.4 million people  over the past decade. Future population growth is projected by the United Nations to  peak at around 11 billion in 2100  and then to slip into slow decline after that. So if we can get through this century without catastrophic environmental effects, then population may start to decline as a contributor to climate change. Of course, there is a lot of  uncertainty  about future population growth, so only time will tell whether the UN\u2019s predictions hold true. There are many ways to tackle climate change, and not all focus on emissions. We could attempt to mitigate its impacts, or adapt to environmental changes, or use technology to remove CO\u2082 directly from the atmosphere On the emissions side, we could look to reduce further the energy intensity or carbon intensity of the economy (the final two factors in the Kaya Identity). Innovations in any of these areas are likely to be the most fruitful avenues for dealing with climate change, in large part because they avoid the most difficult moral questions. But if we are unwilling or unable to make those changes work, and soon, then managing population and economic growth may become our only recourse. At that point, humanity will have to confront increasingly difficult moral questions. Michael P Cameron  is an associate professor in economics at the University of Waikato.

Instead, researchers say two changes will have the biggest impact: cutting back on red meat and driving an electric car. As they don't need fuel or oil, independent think-tank Motu says electric cars make the biggest difference to household emissions and therefore climate change. With the vehicles priced from as little as $20,000, electric car retailer Henry Schmidt says it's a no-brainer. \"New Zealand's about 90 percent renewable energy, we're an ideal country for electric cars.\" Motu researched what people could do to make the biggest difference to emissions.  As well as driving, they concluded air travel and consuming red meat and dairy are major contributors. Dr Suzi Kerr, a professor at Victoria University and Senior Fellow at Motu, says families all around New Zealand could benefit from looking at ways to decrease their household's emissions.  That could just be looking at what they are buying, and what they actually need. \"One of the biggest drivers of your household's emissions is simply what your income is and how much you spend.\u00a0 As they're getting more income they're simply buying more stuff,\" she says. Dr Kerr also adds that households that are trying to reduce emissions sometimes go about it the wrong way.  \"A lot of people think they should be recycling or growing their own veges in order to affect climate change. We don't even include those because they are so small. They're not bad things to do for environmental reasons, but they're not about climate.\" Dr Kerr says wealthier, higher-emitting households fly internationally more often.

Cape Bird\u00a0is an hour's flight from Scott Base, and home to 160,000 Ad\u00e9lie penguins, an Antarctic landscape teaming with life and personality. But the future of the Ad\u00e9lie is in jeopardy. \"We're actually predicting for Antarctica in the next 30 or 40 years, we'll lose 70 percent of the population due to sea ice loss,\" says Phil Lyver, Landcare Research ecologist. Dr Lyver has spent many summers in sub-zero conditions monitoring Antarctica's canary in the coalmine. He weighs 50 chicks by hand every week to check their condition. But measuring the adults' foraging success is much simpler \u2013 in fact, it's as easy as scanning groceries at the supermarket. The sub-colony is fenced off and the only way in and out is over a specially designed weighbridge. \"Each of the birds that we're monitoring has a microchip in it, and as the bird leaves the weighbridge colony we can weigh it so we know how heavy it is, and then it goes to sea, it feeds, when that parent comes back in the weighbridge records its arrival and then it weighs it again,\" says Dr Lyver. \"This season the chicks are in excellent condition.\" That's because the sea ice here is at an optimum level. The penguins use it to launch from to catch things like silverfish and krill, but a further increase in sea ice means they might not make it to the open water and they'll starve, and if there's no ice, there's nothing to fish from. \"In the Ross Sea it's quite different from other parts of Antarctica, which are experiencing climate change,\" says Dr Lyver. \"Our sea ice season here has increased by three months in duration, which is quite in contrast to the peninsula region where they're losing sea ice. It's actually been three months less in that region, and as a consequence we've actually seen penguin colonies disappearing.\" So while the penguins here are climate change winners, the losers are on the Antarctic Peninsula where the temperature has warmed by 2.5 degrees \u2013 a change scientists say is significant enough to erase more than two-thirds of Antarctica's Ad\u00e9lie penguins in just a few decades. 3 News", "headline": "Winners and losers as climate change hits Antarctica", "article_name": "winners-and-losers-as-climate-change-hits-antarctica", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/10/winners-and-losers-as-climate-change-hits-antarctica.html", "date_published": "2013-04-04 15:36:00", "article_length": 2349, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:01.983226"}

Credits: Image - Getty Images; Video - Newshub Newshub can reveal the Climate Change Minister was warned his climate target was too ambitious, too expensive and could be setting New Zealand up to fail. And Treasury warns even a less ambitious goal would lead to either higher taxes or government cuts. It was the moment Climate Change Minister James Shaw had worked for. On the stage in Glasgow, he showed off Aotearoa's upgraded climate commitments to the world. Glasgow was the biggest climate summit since the Paris Agreement in 2015. And just before Shaw left to attend it, he promised we'd cut our greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030. But the Government uses two different measures - what was used on the international stage is a 'point-year target'. That's the 50 percent by 2030. Confusingly the government also expresses this as a multiyear budget which means that 50 percent equates to 41 percent from 2021-2030. \"We did go to the point that we felt that we were able to do,\" he says. But even though the target is 41 per cent, Newshub can reveal his own officials don't think we were able to go beyond 40 percent. In advice to Shaw, the Ministry for the Environment - the climate change experts - said cutting emissions beyond even 40 percent has significant uncertainties and risks of non-delivery. The Treasury - the finance experts - said cutting by even 45 percent had significant fiscal and economic risk that will have to be met by higher taxes and/or the offsetting of other government expenditure. And MBIE - the super-business ministry - was concerned there'd been insufficient analysis undertaken to understand the fiscal and social impacts of a 45 percent reduction. Shaw believes the target is achievable. However ACT leader David Seymour disagrees. \"A 40 percent reduction is not achievable - they went out there and did 50 percent. It's just pure PR and some would say BS,\" he says. Shaw said Seymour didn't understand the reduction targets. \u201cOur climate change targets are not just achievable, they are essential. The next decade is make or break for the planet \u2013 we need to focus all our energies on finding every way we can to lower emissions and limit warming. \u201cMr Seymour's interpretation of official advice is, unsurprisingly, incorrect. When represented in like for like terms, the advice from MfE was actually very close to Cabinet's eventual decision. \u201cI acknowledge climate policy is complicated, but I think it's fair to say if you don't understand it, you're better off not commenting.\u201d Climate scientist Lauren Vargo said having ambitious targets is important. \"I think having high ambitious goals when it comes to climate change is good. Mitigating climate change is very important,\" she says. But those ambitious goals come at a cost - two-thirds of our targeted emission reductions won't be achieved here in New Zealand. Instead, we're going to have to buy overseas credits as well as reducing our own emissions to meet our goal. \"Not doing anything about this will probably be more costly in the long run,\" Vargo warns. How much we cut emissions by is a political decision. Shaw actually wanted more - 45 percent - and after months of negotiations, he got Cabinet to the 41 percent experts called unachievable.

She said New Zealanders would continue to see the Government make progress on climate change. \"You will keep seeing us, of course, making that progress of banning, for instance, the use of thermal baseload generation, we've got our goal to get to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030, [and] we want to stop using coal boilers to generate energy - and on and on it goes.\" ACT leader David  Seymour described the climate emergency declaration as a \"PR stunt\".\u00a0 \"This is a marketing stunt that won't stop one tonne of emissions. If you've got a policy, you don't need to declare an emergency.\" New Zealand would join the UK, Canada, Ireland, and France by declaring a climate emergency.", "headline": "Jacinda Ardern defends decision to declare a climate change emergency in Parliament", "article_name": "jacinda-ardern-defends-decision-to-declare-a-climate-change-emergency-in-parliament", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/11/jacinda-ardern-defends-decision-to-declare-a-climate-change-emergency-in-parliament.html", "date_published": "2020-11-30 09:29:42", "article_length": 1819, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:02.893264"}

Credits: Image: Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick / Facebook; Video: Supplied Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick writing for The Spinoff The political status quo is unfit to confront the climate crisis. We need more of those who will take to the street for what they believe in, rather than sniffing out snide put-downs from air-conditioned television studios, writes New Zealand's youngest parliamentarian. OPINION:  A large contingent of Pasifika south Auckland students led tens of thousands of New Zealanders flooding Queen Street. Hand-made signs declaring a climate emergency shared the four lanes with a life-sized plush squid, tentacles strewn across half a dozen activists. Tangata whenua reminded all that indigenous sovereignty is climate justice, unfurling a gigantic Protect Ihum\u0101tao sign. Small children were pushed in wheelchairs and sat on parents' shoulders. Older kids brandished megaphones and ushered calm order to the masses in bright orange vests. Older people waved signage demanding better from their supposed leaders. Memes ridiculed the indifference of politicians. By organisers' estimates, 80,000 Aucklanders, as part of 170,000 New Zealanders nationwide, joined #FridaysForFuture and #SchoolStrikeForClimate. While this absolutely is what democracy looks like, it's a far cry from the current state of our representative politics. That same Friday morning, politicians from both sides of the aisle dismissed young climate activists, saying they were wasting their youth or should 'grow out' of it. As the youngest member of our Parliament, I'm familiar with such explicitly patronising language. I've found that sentiments like \"grow up\" are typically synonymous with \"give up\" - a passive-aggressive, coded articulation that you're making others uncomfortable with your earnest ideas that we could possibly hope to create a better world. I couldn't care less about the personal jabs. Nor do the facts care about my feelings. If you don't like or trust or want to listen to me, or to the millions of citizens demanding better, listen to the science. Ninety-seven percent of scientists are in strong agreement that humans have sped up global warming, to the point that we now risk not only our species' survival, but biodiversity and the world as we know it. The climate emergency is confronting us either by design or systemic neglect. We created this mess. Politicians across the world have their hands on the wheel of a car that they are driving directly into a forest fire. They can see the fire. They have been, and are being, constantly warned about it as they drive. The heat and smoke is starting to make some of the car passengers uncomfortable, sick and coughing. Politicians have their hands on the wheel and their feet at the pedals. They can slow the car. They can stop it. They can choose a different path: one that doesn't lead to destruction of the car, its passengers - ultimately of civilisation as a whole. It just so happens politicians are among the least trusted professionals on planet Earth. This state of affairs offers a perverse feedback loop; those who are most disgusted at their actions, those who feel the least represented and least heard, are among the first to turn off. This narrows the field of available voters, as people who have become disenchanted and disenfranchised are far harder to reach and turn out, a shallower pool emerges. When people feel deeply unrepresented, they're less likely to engage, and therefore the chance things might change descends into an ever downward spiral. Fear and anger almost always turn up to the ballot box, but they don't regularly manifest in solutions. They're intentionally targeted by self-styled strongmen who conjure up scapegoats and divisiveness. New Zealand has been privy to its fair share of attempted polarisation recently. An unignorable 48 percent of our country's emissions coming from agriculture, which evidently must reduce if we are to do our bit to help keep global warming within 1.5 degrees. That is a fact. It is also a fact that thousands of New Zealanders work on the farms and in the industry that, unfortunately, produces these emissions. These people are important, and they - like all of us - deserve a warm, dry home, meaningful work, a sense of identity and strong community ties. Some politicians have sought to sever those two crucial components for their own gain. They don't talk about helping our farmers transition, but speak in divisive, binary, fanciful rhetoric You can only have one, they assert: a liveable climate or regional development. They ignore the reality that farmers are already being hit with climate breakdown in ever-less predictable seasonality and increasing international standards on carbon transparency. And still, those politicians will do their best to divide us, and they will tell those who will listen that the young people and those who stood in solidarity with them to demand urgent climate action aren't trying to ensure we're all better off; these politicians will say these activists are trying to hurt you. The tactics are Trumpian: diminish trust in everyone and every source but those that reinforce your world view. More than 150,000 New Zealanders marched in the streets calling for stronger climate action, but with two and a half weeks until the Zero Carbon Bill is reported back to parliament, it remains unclear if the National Party will support it. That cross-party support is seen as critical to the long term stability of the legislation and the independent Climate Commission. That cross-party support helped in the UK's Climate Change Act 2008, on which the Zero Carbon Bill is based. At least one senior National Party former minister - that's Judith Collins - has publicly stated she will not support it. Both Simon Bridges and the party's former climate change spokesperson, Todd Muller, say they couldn't offer caucus votes unless the already controversially split-target for methane drops even lower than its present 24 percent-47 percent reduction by 2050 range. To spell it out, in practice this means that our defining piece of climate action legislation - one which 170,000 Kiwis just this last Friday demanded be made stronger and delivered faster - risks passing with only the Government majority of 64 votes to 56 votes. That vote is less than three weeks out. I can't stress it enough: this is a law that - at present - a massive number of New Zealanders do not see as bold or progressive enough to the extent that they were willing to put their bodies, their education and in some places their jobs on the line. Status quo politics cannot solve climate breakdown. It created it. Through generations of lobbying, unequal access, donations and manipulation, the political system has grown into a monolith bred to protect and conserve the way things are. So-called leaders dismiss young people terrified for their future on the basis of their age. They dismiss scientists for sounding the alarm about the urgency of action required. Nothing, it would seem, will sink in except reinforcement of cognitive biases. These politicians arm themselves with a deeply entrenched ideology, something they accuse everyone else of having. There were five demands from the New Zealand School Strike, and the Greens are the only party even close to agreeing with every single one. We are eight MPs of 120 in Parliament, and while we've leveraged the hell out of our size to achieve more climate change action in this term of Government than the last 30 years, we'll be the first to say we want to go further, faster. We can only do that with greater numbers. Regardless of whether you choose to engage in politics, the decisions it produces govern your life. If you drink water, breathe air and value a roof over your head at night, it's important to remember that the accessibility, quality and affordability of all of those things is inherently political. If you don't trust your politicians, find somebody who you do trust, and support them in running. We've still got so much more to do, but we will only achieve it with our hands on the wheel. We need representatives in positions of power who are there not to hold up the marble walls, but to knock them down. I'm heartened by the reminder that if I - a highschool drop-out with tattoos and a potty mouth - can somehow wind up in Parliament, anybody can. And we need more anybodys; the kind who will take to the street for what they believe in, instead of offering snide put-downs from the comfort of an air-conditioned television studio. The sentiment lives in the chant that bellowed across Queen Street last week: \"We are not drowning! We are fighting!\" Take the fight to election 2020. I agree climate action should not be partisan. But the reality is stark: a number of political parties do not as it stands want to make the sufficient steps to deal with it. If you marched on Friday, you already know that.

Some of them will be gathering at Parliament on Thursday, supporting colleagues inside making submissions on the Bill. Spokesperson Alex Macmillan, a public health lecturer at the University of Otago says the link between climate change and health is undeniable. \"Health workers in New Zealand are really worried about climate change - nurses, doctors - because it has huge impacts on health and wellbeing of New Zealanders.\" The Bill  aims to have New Zealand's net carbon output at zero by 2050, and methane emissions cut up to 47 percent by 2050. Methane was given its own less ambitious target than carbon because of New Zealand's reliance on agriculture, a big source of both income and emissions.\u00a0 The Climate and Health Council says meat's link with obesity, along with rising sea levels and increased exposure to sunlight, are all causing havoc on our health.\u00a0 \"Obesity and diabetes and cancer and air pollution and road traffic injuries - we can really do a lot about lots of those health issues by taking well-designed action on climate change,\" says Dr Macmillan, adding that our relationship to meat has to change. \"Not only are they our biggest source of emissions, but transforming our food system is really important for a range of health outcomes.\" In a  piece for The Conversation earlier this month , Dr Macmillan said climate change would worsen health inequalities. She linked the 2016 Havelock North campylobacter outbreak to an extreme rainfall event, the likes of which will become more frequent as the atmosphere warms. \"If we reduce our transport emissions by improving access to safe walking and cycling routes and electric public transport, air quality will improve and we build physical exercise back into our daily lives,\" she wrote. \"Shifting our farming sector from a heavy focus on producing milk powder towards plant-based food production would not only change our national diets for the better, but also ensure we are resilient to global food price shocks and improve our fresh and drinking water.\" Changing temperatures are also reducing yields from wheat and fish, she said. \"When this worsens, the result is, perversely, an increase in obesity and diabetes, accompanied by nutrient deficiencies, as families rely on cheap, highly processed foods to get by.\" Supporters will gather outside Parliament at 12:30pm.\u00a0 Newshub. \u00a0", "headline": "Fighting climate change vital to protect Kiwis' health - doctor", "article_name": "fighting-climate-change-vital-to-protect-kiwis-health-doctor", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/08/fighting-climate-change-vital-to-protect-kiwis-health-doctor.html", "date_published": "2019-08-29 06:51:02", "article_length": 2762, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:03.425088"}

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty A state-of-the-art climate modelling system which recently predicted an ice-free Arctic by 2050 might be running a bit hot,  according to a new study . CESM2 is one of 27 climate models included in version six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, which will be used by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its next major climate report.\u00a0 Together they're known as CMIP6. This system was used in  a study published in April  which said the Arctic would start losing its ice in summer very soon, even if we managed to rapidly reduce carbon emissions in the short-term. \"This really surprised us,\" said Dirk Notz of the University of Hamburg, who led that research. \"The Arctic will become practically sea-ice free in September before the year 2050... in all scenarios.\" But a closer look at CESM2 has suggested a potential explanation for the extreme result - it could simply be wrong.\u00a0 Climate scientists at the University of Michigan used it to simulate the climate in the Early Eocene, 50 million years ago, a time when the Earth warmed and rainforests thrived around the tropics of the Americas. They found it predicted temperatures of over 55C, \"much higher than the temperature tolerance of plant photosynthesis\".\u00a0 In other words, it would have been so hot plants couldn't survive. But the fossil record shows they in fact did quite well.\u00a0 \"Some of the newest models used to make future predictions may be too sensitive to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and thus predict too much warming,\" said Chris Poulsen, study co-author.\u00a0 They said CESM2 predicts warming of about 5.3C if carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are sustained at double the pre-industrial level of 285 parts per million. This is higher than its predecessor - CSEM1.2 - which predicts 4.2C of warming. Testing of CSEM1.2 showed it accurately predicted the climate 50 million years ago. \" Our study  implies that CESM2's climate sensitivity of 5.3 C is likely too high. This means that its prediction of future warming under a high-CO2 scenario would be too high as well,\" said co-author Jiang Zhu. Carbon levels are presently at 418 parts per million. In the Early Eocene, it's estimated they  may have been five times higher , with volcanoes probably to blame. Temperatures then were up to 14C higher than today. But don't think this is an excuse to dismiss dire warnings about the future of our climate entirely.  A study that came out in March , just weeks before the headline-grabbing April findings, had the same conclusion - that the Arctic will likely have ice-free summers by 2050.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Twitter / @helenv19 / @ikaveri On Tuesday, after days of government-imposed lockdown amidst the rampant COVID-19 pandemic, Venice locals were surprised to learn they had something to celebrate. As they looked down from their balconies, they saw something many of them had never seen in their decades living in the city. Transparent water was flowing through their canals, and in it all manner of aquatic life.\u00a0\u00a0 With so few tourists in Venice and an enforced lockdown across the city, boat traffic and pollution has eased, clearing the water and also  improving air quality . Coronavirus has  ravaged Italy , with 35,713 positive cases and 2978 deaths so far - but the healing effect it's having on the environment is one bright spot in the midst of widespread tragedy. And it's not just Italy. All around the world, extreme public health measures are causing the natural environment to flourish. China, the  world's biggest polluter , was ground zero for the coronavirus outbreak. Stringent self-isolation measures were introduced there last month, and as a result there were fewer vehicles on the roads and a major slowdown in manufacturing and industrial emissions. The world's first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan in January, which has since become the first Chinese city to experience a  noticeable uptick in air quality . Locals celebrated that rather than the thick smog that normally blankets the city, blue skies had emerged instead. This improvement is confirmed by NASA satellite imagery, which shows it's not just in Wuhan that things are getting better, but the entire country. All over China, the average density of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide - a toxic chemical that reduces immunity - has dropped significantly below normal levels. \"This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,\" said NASA air quality researcher Fei Liu. While coronavirus has tragically claimed 3237 Chinese lives, there are some suggestions many more have been saved by the improved air quality. One Stanford University expert, Marshall Burke, believes between  50,000 and 75,000 premature deaths \u00a0have been prevented already, simply due to cleaner air across the country. \"The reductions in air pollution in China caused by this economic disruption likely saved 20 times more lives in China than have currently been lost due to infection with the virus in that country,\" he wrote on online scientific research platform G-Feed. However, Dr Burke says he doesn't want to insinuate that COVID-19 is a good thing for humanity overall. \"Does this mean pandemics are good for health? No,\" he said. \"Instead, it means that the way our economies operate absent pandemics has massive hidden health costs, and it takes a pandemic to help see that.\" While many are noting the positive environmental impacts that have followed the spread of COVID-19, the  International Energy Agency (IEA) isn't hopeful  it'll have a lasting impact. The global energy watchdog says reduced air travel and less industrial pollution are temporary, and likely to bounce back quickly once the threat of coronavirus passes. \"There is nothing to celebrate in a likely decline in emissions driven by economic crisis because in the absence of the right policies and structural measures, this decline will not be sustainable,\" said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. With this very concern in mind, eight US Democrats  signed a letter  urging President Donald Trump to put conditions on greenhouse gas emission at the forefront of any financial aid deal with US airlines. \"If we give the airline and cruise industries assistance without requiring them to be better environmental stewards, we would miss a major opportunity to combat climate change and ocean dumping,\" the letter reads. Former President Barack Obama applied climate change measures when the US government bailed out GM and Chrysler in 2009, using the opportunity to enforce stricter fuel-economy rules. However President Trump has since  relaxed those rules \u00a0and pulled out of the  Paris Climate Agreement , which doesn't bode well for the chances of him introducing tough environmental measures for the air travel and cruise industries. Greenpeace warns it's likely China, too, will do little to combat climate change long-term. It says China is likely to focus all its attention on reviving the economy as quickly as possible when the coronavirus crisis eases - in turn putting a  phenomenon dubbed \"revenge pollution\"  into action. \"There might be a round of economic stimulus which would inject cheap credits to heavy industries in China,\" Li Shuo, senior climate policy advisor for Greenpeace East Asia, told CNN. \"As a result of that, we might see increasing pollutants and also carbon emissions in the second half of this year.\" But hope remains it will have a lasting impact. \"We would very much advocate for China to foster this opportunity to transform its economy, to break apart from the old,\" Li added. As a country that produces a third of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, for China to reduce its ecological footprint would be a huge step to a sustainable planet.

Government experts are to work on a 'rule book' for the 2015 climate pact at the November 6-17 annual meeting in Bonn, Germany. The accord seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century with a shift to wind, solar and other clean energies. Mr Trump once dismissed climate change as a Chinese hoax to harm the US economy and said in June that he would pull out of the agreement and instead promote US coal and oil. A formal US withdrawal will take until 2020. No other nation has followed his lead. US influence is likely to wane compared to other big greenhouse emitters led by China, the European Union and India, even though Washington will still have a place at the table in Bonn. \"The rest of the world, including all major emerging economies, has made it clear that it is committed to the Paris Agreement,\" Maldives Environment Minister Thor Abraham, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (OASIS), told Reuters. China, on track to beat its goal of a peak in carbon emissions in 2030, seems best placed to step up leadership of an agreement largely designed by Washington under former President Barack Obama, many delegates say. The meeting \"will be a great free advertisement for China\", one European environment minister said. And Beijing plans to launch a nationwide carbon market this year, albeit delayed from the first half. \"The results [in Bonn] will prove that this process has certainly not stopped,\" China's top climate official, Xi Zhenhua, told a news conference last week. He expressed hopes that Washington will end up staying in the Paris pact. Adding urgency, 2017 is set to be the second warmest on record, behind 2016, according to NASA. And 2017 has had weather extremes of hurricanes, floods and drought-fuelled wildfires. Fiji will preside at the Bonn talks, the first small island nation to do so in more than two decades of UN climate negotiations.

This fear makes it hard for her to sleep and causes her to feel guilty whenever she takes time for herself.\u00a0 The potentially disastrous effects of climate change are always on her mind.\u00a0 \"It's the anxiety that things won't be enough and that I need to spend every minute of every day working on this for it to be enough.\"\u00a0 The overwhelming dread makes it hard for her to do things she loves like going for a run, walking on the beach or watching TV.\u00a0 \"If I sit down and watch a Netflix show or go for a run, I just feel like well maybe if I had spent that hour doing something important like climate strike organising then we might have a better chance of survival for those generations to come,\" she said.\u00a0 Handford isn't alone in her feelings of despair and dread.\u00a0 \n Co-convener of the NZ climate psychology task force Brian Dixon says anxiety is a rational response to the climate crisis.\u00a0\u00a0 He said anxiety is based on feelings of uncertainty and a lack of control, which makes sense when dealing with something as big as climate change.\u00a0 When it comes to coping with climate anxiety, Dixon says the best thing to do is what Handford is already doing - take action.\u00a0 Action helps people feel in control, which can minimise feelings of anxiety and hopelessness.\u00a0 \"If you feel that you have some agency\u2026 that's really helpful for dealing with those thoughts and doubts and worries.\" However, he said anxiety isn't necessarily a bad thing if it is motivating people to get involved in preventing climate change. \"Our survival and evolution has been based on people having feelings, including negative ones,\" he said.\u00a0 \"It's important to understand that people get motivated to make changes when they become concerned enough about something.\" While climate anxiety may seem like a unique challenge for this generation, experts have compared it to the anxiety that people experienced during the Cold War.\u00a0 Dixon said while there are a lot of similarities, in many ways, climate anxiety is worse.\u00a0 \"Climate change is much bigger and it has more of a global finality risk, so the stakes are probably higher.\" He said during the Cold War people learned to live with that anxiety while waiting, and hoping, leaders would reach a peaceful resolution. But with climate change, it is harder to leave it to the leaders.\u00a0 \"It's difficult to tell people to get on with it and leave it to the leaders because the leaders haven't actually done what they need to do.\" Dixon said holding on to hope is crucial to reducing climate anxiety, even when things feel overwhelming.\u00a0 He said focusing on the positives will stop people getting bogged down by anxiety.\u00a0 Sociology teaching fellow at Victoria University Jonathan Oosterman said hope is crucial, but needs to be realistic.\u00a0 He said when people feel hopeless, they can sometimes isolate themselves from the climate crisis because it feels \"too big\" to solve.\u00a0 Oosterman warned this can cause people to deny climate change because they feel they are being blamed for it or that there is nothing they can do about it. These feelings can be changed when the solutions are realistic and not just a quick fix, he said.\u00a0\u00a0 \"All the conversations around climate focus on this idea that you just need to change your lightbulbs, but that's not meeting people in their experiences of climate anxiety, and it's also not meeting the realistic nature of the challenge.\" He said while small changes like using energy efficient light bulbs are good, they won\u2019t solve the climate crisis and people need to focus on the bigger issues.\u00a0 Oosterman said the real solutions come from international change and government policies, not individual choices.\u00a0 When it comes to anxiety, taking part in community lead activism like marching or joining a community garden helps people feel in control, he said.\u00a0 Oosterman said connecting with people who share your concerns is a good way to deal with anxiety because it allows you to share your fears with others who will understand them and not dismiss them. Oosterman, who has a background in climate activism, also acknowledged the importance of taking breaks when needed, warning against getting caught in a cycle of anxiety and action. He said he suffered from burnout in 2005 because he was constantly feeling anxious and sad.\u00a0 \"I was trying to come to terms with the risk of billions of people dying and that was juxtaposed with the fact that we didn't have, and still don't have, anywhere near sufficient action.\" He was so exhausted that he decided to take a break and focus on recharging.\u00a0 Burnout is something Sophie Handford worries about a lot. The 18-year-old struggles to make time for herself in her everyday routine.\u00a0 \"I definitely feel guilty for doing anything other than trying to save the planet which sucks.\" However, she is slowly coming to terms with the fact that she can't ignore her own needs.\u00a0 \u201cIt isn\u2019t a sustainable way of living because if I am constantly putting all my energy into climate strikes, then I am not doing as well as I could be because I am not taking breaks and time for myself.\u201d While fear and frustration are her main drivers, Handford said hope is also a huge motivator for her.\u00a0 \"A lot of what I am doing is driven out of fear, but also out of a part of me that knows that if we act now we will create a better world for the generations to come.\" She said she feels like there is way too much at stake to not take action.\u00a0 Newshub.", "headline": "How to cope with climate anxiety and despair", "article_name": "how-to-cope-with-climate-anxiety-and-despair", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/09/how-to-cope-with-climate-anxiety-and-despair.html", "date_published": "2019-09-29 16:02:49", "article_length": 6195, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:04.448481"}

Credits: Image - Getty; Video - The AM Show Despite good work being done to tackle climate change, we still need to do much more, a leading climate scientist says. \n The Government introduced its Zero Carbon Bill in May, but since then actual greenhouse emissions have continued to rise. \"Actual emissions are still going up, so we're not tackling the real problem,\" says Professor James Renwick of Victoria University. He says it's promising that many local councils are declaring climate emergencies and awareness of the problems is increasing, but the time to sit by and do nothing has passed. \"I think we have to have that step before we do get to the action, but we need the action,\" Prof Renwick told The AM Show on Monday morning. \"It's all very well for local governments to declare emergencies, great stuff, but they need resources to make things happen. And I think it needs to be coordinated across the whole country.\" The Government's Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Bill laid out a 30-year plan aimed at limiting global warming to no more than 1.5degC. Prof Renwick said that although the Bill has the best of intentions, progress is frustratingly slow. \"It is taking a long time and that's the political process, I suppose. It's pretty frustrating. But the outline of the Zero Carbon Bill is in line with the science.\" The Bill also aims at providing certainty to industries affected by climate change or which may be contributing to emissions. Prof Renwick says the country needs to change the way it thinks about the economy if it is to successfully combat climate change.\u00a0 \"We've got to decarbonise the economy. We've got to decouple economic growth, economic development from emissions of greenhouse gases.\" Although that may mean job losses in some sectors, Prof Renwick is confident those loesses would be offset by more jobs in other industries. \"We're talking about working differently in the future so I don't know that there will necessarily be less jobs around but they'll be different jobs.\" Prof Renwick admits meeting the goals is a \"big ask\" but says we have no choice but to get there. \"We've got to go for it because if we don't the consequences, the cost to the economy and society, will be just astronomical - so we really have to give it everything we've got.\" Newshub. \u00a0", "headline": "NZ climate emissions rising since Zero Carbon Bill introduced", "article_name": "nz-climate-emissions-rising-since-zero-carbon-bill-introduced", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/09/nz-climate-emissions-rising-since-zero-carbon-bill-introduced.html", "date_published": "2019-09-16 10:55:14", "article_length": 2390, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:04.644576"}
{"id": null, "body": "The sight of thousands of whales surfacing, jumping and playing off the coast of South America as they migrate toward their breeding grounds is one of nature's most majestic displays. But global warming is killing off their food and changing their age-old migratory routes. To the tourists watching a humpback whale frolic with her newborn calf in the tropical waters off Ecuador's coast near Puerto Lopez, the sight of enormous fins surfacing, tails flipping and blowholes spouting is breathtaking. The same scenes can be found up and down the South American coast, from Puerto Piramides in Argentina to Cabo Blanco in Peru and Bahia Malaga in Colombia. But to marine biologists, these huge mammals are not as carefree and healthy as they appear. They are skinny, covered in parasites and exhausted from the increasingly long journeys they are making to reproduce. \"You can see their bones. They're sick. They have parasites. We never used to see that,\" said Ecuadorian marine biologist Cristina Castro as she scanned the horizon for more humpback whales, the species she has studied for the past 18 years. These whales swim thousands of kilometres each year from Antarctica to the waters around the equator to have their young, which measure 3-4.5m at birth and can weigh up to one tonne. But as ocean temperatures rise, whales are migrating earlier and travelling further. Warmer waters are killing off the supply of krill, the small crustaceans that are whales' main food source in their Arctic feeding grounds. The whales eat several tonnes a day to fatten up for their journeys. Rising temperatures also trick the whales' biological clocks into thinking it is time to migrate. \"They are changing their migration cycles. They used to arrive here in July. Now we see them in May,\" said Castro. Whales are also continuing north beyond the equator, as far as Costa Rica \u2013 a behaviour never seen before, she told AFP. The International Whaling Commission estimates there were 8000 to 10,000 humpback whales this year in the Pacific breeding grounds, which stretch from Peru to Costa Rica. Roger Payne, the American scientist who brought humpback whales' songs to world attention in the 1970s, said whales are also threatened by the acidification of the oceans caused by rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the water. Forty-five years of research off Argentina have shown that this and other effects of climate change are killing off whales' food, he said. \"The females will give birth only when the conditions to feed their young are favourable,\" Payne told AFP. \"Nothing is nearly as important as the threat that we get from that effect.\" When there are less krill in Antarctica, birth rates drop at the equator, and calves tend to have a worse survival rate. \"Everything is linked,\" said Payne's Argentine colleague Mariano Sironi, a specialist in southern right whales. In the latest alarming news, researchers said on Tuesday (local time) at least 337 dead whales had been found washed up in a remote inlet in Patagonia in southern Chile \u2013 one of the largest die-offs on record. \"It was an apocalyptic sight,\" said Vreni Haussermann, one of the scientists who made the discovery on a flyover in June. It is not known what killed the whales, or if the event was linked to climate change. The cyclical warming of the central Pacific \u2013 the El Nino phenomenon \u2013 is making matters worse and is a harbinger of the dangers to come, researchers said.

{"id": null, "body": "Watch: Alexa Cook reports on the new IPCC report which calls for global emissions to be curbed by 2030.  Credits: Image: Getty Images; Video: Newshub. By Thomas Wiedmann, Arunima Malik, Glen Peters, Jacqueline Peel and Xuemei Bai for The Conversation \n The world has its best chance yet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly, but hard and fast cuts are needed across all sectors and nations to hold warming to safe levels, the global authority on climate change says. Released on Tuesday morning, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report says opportunities to affordably cut global emissions have risen sharply since the last assessment of this kind in 2014. But the need to act has also become far more urgent. The report is the definitive assessment of how well the world is doing in finding solutions to rising temperatures. We each contributed expertise to the report. Here, we explain key aspects of the findings and what it means for the world. The report finds that the world has made progress on emissions reduction over the last decade. Growth in greenhouse gas emissions slowed to 1.3 percent per year in the 2010s, compared to 2.1 percent in the 2000s. But global emissions remain at record highs. If policy ambition does not ramp up immediately, warming will shoot past 1.5C and be well on the way to 2C - failing to meet the temperature goals of the  Paris Agreement .\u00a0 Alarmingly, the world's current policies put us on track for global warming of between 2.2C and 3.5C within 80 years. It's far better than the 4C or more feared about a decade ago but still far from consistent with the Paris Agreement. To have a 50 percent chance of keeping global warming to 1.5C by the century's end, global CO\u2082 emissions must halve in a decade, reach net zero in the 2050s and go net negative thereafter. Methane emissions would also have to halve by 2050 in these scenarios. Halving global emissions by 2030 is viable and achievable, the IPCC says. But it requires an immediate step-change in climate policy across all sectors, countries and levels of government. Rich nations must make the most rapid emissions reductions. This includes Australia, where a  plan  for net-zero emissions by 2050 falls short of the ambition needed and is not yet backed by policy.\u00a0 The report is a comprehensive catalogue of what can be done - but has mostly not yet been done - to avert devastating climate change. Some trends are encouraging. Some 36 countries have successfully cut greenhouse gas emissions over more than a decade. And opportunities to cut emissions affordably and cheaply have multiplied enormously since 2014, the report finds. This is largely due to the plunging costs of renewables, which promises emissions reduction beyond the energy sector in areas such as manufacturing and heavy transport. We expand on the options  here . But change is not coming fast enough. The report confirms that all energy efficiency gains in the last decade have been more than outpaced by economic and population growth. Technology is not a silver bullet. To have a chance of halving global emissions by 2030, we must use fewer high-carbon products and adopt less emissions-intensive lifestyles. Like all other changes required, these cannot be incremental, the IPCC says. In 2016, the UN Sustainable Development Goals - an action plan for people, the planet and prosperity - came into effect. Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising future generations. And as the latest IPCC report emphasises, it cannot be achieved without effective climate action. One Sustainable Development Goal explicitly focuses on tackling climate change. But climate action is linked to all other goals, including those relating to energy, cities, industry, land, water and people. Emissions reduction policies must be inclusive and avoid unintended consequences such as exacerbating existing poverty and hunger. The transition to a low-carbon world should be equitable and leave no one behind. The IPCC report calls for both accelerated climate action and a just transition. This requires well-designed policies at all levels of government, and across all sectors. International co-operation is key. This report is the first to assess the Paris Agreement, which took effect from 2020. Under the agreement, countries submit and update pledges on emissions reduction and adapting to the changing climate. For these pledges to be achieved globally, high-income countries must help other nations by providing finance, access to clean energy technologies and other assistance and know-how. The IPCC identified a shortfall in global climate finance. In particular, high-income countries missed their 2020 target to mobilise $US100 billion per year. The Paris Agreement is a treaty but the pledges are voluntary. Countries set their own targets and can't be forced to meet them. So, is it working? According to this new report, it largely is - albeit slowly. For instance, it has encouraged nations such as Australia to make more ambitious emissions pledges. It has also enhanced transparency, enabling outside groups, such as those in civil society, to assess countries' progress. Other international mechanisms, such as global business partnerships and youth climate protests, are also driving change. But more must be done to halve emissions this decade. The IPCC report found that about 70 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are produced in cities and urban areas. This offers both challenges and opportunities for emissions reduction. To date, more than 1000 cities worldwide have signed up to net-zero emission goals. To fulfill the Paris Agreement, more cities must step up and work towards goals such as 100 percent renewable energy, zero-carbon transport, decarbonising construction and improving waste management. Developing countries are rapidly urbanising, which requires new housing and infrastructure. But doing so in a business-as-usual way could lead to substantial new emissions, the IPCC warns. City leaders must embrace integrated planning and management to meet the climate challenge. This must be achieved while cities continue their important roles in maintaining social, economic and environmental well-being. We need all hands on deck: businesses, communities, researchers and citizens. This latest report shows how the choices we make now will determine the fate of generations to come - and all life on this planet. Humanity has already missed so many opportunities to stabilise Earth's climate. We now have the chance to right some of those past wrongs. Only an urgent, concerted effort across all sectors and nations, starting today, will deliver the change needed. This article is republished from  The Conversation  under a Creative Commons licence.

{"id": null, "body": "James Young-Drew, Generation Zero's Zero Carbon Act policy lead, speaks to Newshub.  Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty The Government has announced details on how it will combat climate change. On Wednesday, the Government will introduce the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Bill into Parliament to address the long-term challenges of climate change. Billing it as \"landmark action\" that acts as a plan for the next 30 years, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the Bill provides certainty to industries affected by climate change or which may be contributing to emissions. \"The Government is today delivering landmark action on climate change \u00a0the biggest challenge facing the international community and New Zealand,\" she said. The Bill will create a legally binding objective to limit global warming to no more than 1.5degC with a net zero carbon approach. Climate Change Minister James Shaw said Government needs to work with the agriculture industry to manage emissions and subsequently has created a specific target for biogenic methane. A 10 percent reduction in biological methane emissions by 2030 is the target set out in the Bill, with a provisional reduction ranging from 24 percent to 47 percent the aim by 2050. An independent Climate Change Commission will be established to \"support our emissions reduction targets through advice, guidance, and regular five-yearly 'emissions budgets',\" Shaw said. The 2050 provisional reduction range for biogenic methane will be subject to review by the Commission in 2024 to account for changes in scientific knowledge. Methane emissions large come from livestock belching while carbon dioxide can come from transport.\u00a0 Planting more forests will help offset any carbon emissions.\u00a0 The Bill also requires the Government to plan for how it will support Kiwi towns, cities, businesses, farmers and iwi adapt to the results of climate change on the environment. \"New Zealanders have made it clear they want leadership and consensus on climate change legislation,\" said Shaw. The Climate Change Stocktake Report for 2017/18 notes that by 2040 New Zealand's air temperature is forecast to increase by 0.7-1degC, and 3degC higher by 2090. As a result of warming temperatures, sea levels are projected to rise by 0.3-1 metre by 2100. But the threat of Antarctic sheets collapsing could mean this range substantially increases. In 2015, New Zealand signed up to the Paris Agreement, agreeing to keep global average temperatures below 2degC and pursuing efforts to limit to 1.5degC. The Bill is similar to the United Kingdom's Climate Change Act which also requires five-yearly carbon budgets with key targets set. Parties react \n Shaw acknowledged National Party leader Simon Bridges and National Climate Change spokesperson Todd Muller for \"setting politics to one side\" while working on the Bill. \"We're delighted that the three Government partners have reached an agreement over such a significant piece of legislation after lengthy consultation.\" \n \"The fact that, across Parliament, all parties have engaged constructively in this process signals mutual interest in creating enduring climate change legislation that will stand the test of time and deliver long-lasting commitment to action on climate change for future generations,\" said Shaw. But Bridges said that while the parties had found common ground on the Commission, net zero targets for long lived gases. and the seperate treatment of methane, National has resevations about the expected rate of reduction for methane. \"We are not convinced that the proposed\u00a024-47 per cent reduction for methane meets our test in terms of science, economic impact or global response,\" Bridges said. \"We're committed to taking short term politics out of climate change policy, by having an enduring Commission which will give science-based advice for successive governments.\" The ACT Party will oppose the legislation, saying action in New Zealand will do little to change the climate. \"We account for just 0.17 percent of global emissions,\" said leader David Seymour. \"As with her Government\u2019s positions on oil and gas exploration, gun laws, and social media, the Prime Minister is more concerned about a global audience than good policymaking. \"But the idea that the United States, China, India and others large emitters will follow our lead on climate change is na\u00efve.\" He said cutting emissions will severely damage New Zealand's economy. Shaw encourages the public to submit on the Bill as it works its way through the select committee process and for everyone to play their part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Path to the Bill The Government intends to have the Zero Carbon Bill become law by the end of the year, but it's  been a long journey for the legislation . Before the 2017 election, Shaw said he wanted to pass a form of the Bill  within the Government's first 100 days . Ardern also called it this generation's nuclear free moment. Introducing a Zero Carbon Act and establishing an Independent Climate Commission to make progess towards a Net Zero Emissions Economy by 2050 was a key part of Labour and the Green Party's confidence and supply agreement. \n This was also in the coalition agreement between Labour and New Zealand First. More than 15,000 people submitted on the Bill during its consultation stage in 2018, with 91 percent supporting net zero emissions for all greenhouse gases by 2050. In January, it was revealed  that some local councils wanted more evidence  proving man-made climate change before they supported the legislation.

Credits: Image - Facebook; Video - Magic Talk National MP Scott Simpson has blasted James Shaw over what he's described as a \"shocker of an interview\" the minister gave about teaching climate change in schools.\u00a0\u00a0 Simpson, the National Party's climate change spokesperson, said he had listened to Shaw's interview with Magic Talk's Sean Plunket about a new resource for teaching year 7-10 students about climate change.\u00a0 \"Somebody sent me a link to it several days ago and I've subsequently had an opportunity to hear that shocker of an interview that James Shaw did with you,\" Simpson, MP for Coromandel, told Plunket on Wednesday.\u00a0 \"Of course people are going to be concerned and worried about this and I can understand completely why the phone lines to your show and other media have been running hot. \"Climate change should be an issue that is talked about and taught in our schools, but it's a question of how it's done and I think listening to the interview you did with James Shaw, the minister is usually over his brief, but sadly he wasn't that day. \"I just think what's happened here is that it's a kneejerk reaction [from Shaw], trying to - in an election year - have some kind of delivery for his Green Party base.\" Shaw, co-leader of the Green Party,  clashed with Plunket during the interview  earlier this week, when the minister was invited to discuss the new teacher resource announced on Sunday.\u00a0 Plunket said he was concerned the syllabus would leave no room for students to question or debate the human impact of climate change, but Shaw said it's all based on science so \"you can dispute that all you like\".\u00a0 Shaw said there had been high demand from teachers wanting resources to teach climate change in schools, so once it was piloted and some changes were made, it \"seemed appropriate to be rolling out\".\u00a0 The pilot was picked up by the Ministry of Education and is supported by organisations including NASA, NIWA, and National Geographic for Kids, among others.\u00a0 The resource cites sources including the Ministry for the Environment, Stats NZ, the Department of Conservation, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations Environment Program's climate body.\u00a0 Simpson isn't the first to speak out against the new resource. ACT leader David Seymour said he  fears it's designed to suppress opposing views  on humankind's influence on the climate.\u00a0 Simpson had a similar view, telling Plunket: \"The ability for various views to be expressed around climate change issues seems to be lacking from this resource.\" Seymour, MP for Epsom, has criticised aspects of the resource such as an activity called \"myth buster role-play\" where one student will play the role of an 'activist' for climate change and the other a 'sceptic'.\u00a0 \"I just think that sort of exercise, given that it doesn't provide any sort of resource or credence to why people might be sceptical, amounts to state-organised bullying of kids,\" Seymour said.\u00a0 Simpson said after reading the resource, it seemed like \"pieces of information that are picked randomly from a whole range of sources and then put together in a cross-match sort of way\".\u00a0 The resource  includes a lesson on Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg , dealing with \"scepticism\", understanding feelings about climate change, and advice to eat less meat.\u00a0 \"There are some issues around dietary dogma, for instance, and the call to activism, and issues around how to handle people who have a different point of view - so-called deniers,\" Simpson said.\u00a0 He said National's education spokesperson Nikki Kaye has \"been doing some extensive work in this area\" and will be issuing an official response \"soon\". The resource also includes lessons on understanding the difference between climate and weather, how climate change could affect New Zealand, and New Zealand's current commitments to tackling the issue.\u00a0 Shaw told Newshub\u00a0a warming planet \"is the reality kids today are facing\" and it's \"only right that they have the opportunity to discuss what this means, talk about solutions, ask questions and find their own answers\".\u00a0 He said leaving behind a world that is \"safe for our kids and grandkids\" will require\u00a0\"efforts from every one of us to improve the way we farm, design our cities, and produce energy for things like transport and heating our homes\". \"The new climate change resource simply reflects this reality.\"", "headline": "MP Scott Simpson blasts James Shaw's 'shocker of an interview' on teaching climate change", "article_name": "mp-scott-simpson-blasts-james-shaw-s-shocker-of-an-interview-on-teaching-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/mp-scott-simpson-blasts-james-shaw-s-shocker-of-an-interview-on-teaching-climate-change.html", "date_published": "2020-01-15 17:55:18", "article_length": 4524, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:06.160224"}

Dr Blackman says no one's really sure just how much methane is beneath the Earth's surface, except that it's a \"heck of a lot\". \"Methane is a greenhouse gas, and it's actually a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide,\" he says. \"There's methane all over the planet \u2013 it gets formed when organic matter decays.

{"id": null, "body": "Watch as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern declares a climate change emergency.   Credits: Parliament TV Off the back of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's declaration of a climate change emergency, the Government plans to make the public sector carbon neutral by 2025.\u00a0 The Carbon Neutral Government Programme will require public sector agencies to measure and publicly report on their emissions and to offset any they can't cut by 2025. It will be backed by a $200 million State Sector Decarbonisation Fund that will finance the replacement of public sector coal boilers and support the immediate purchase of electric or hybrid vehicles to start replacing the Government's petrol car fleet. \"Requiring the public sector to be carbon neutral within five years highlights the Government's commitment to leadership on climate change and the urgency of the action required,\" Ardern said on Wednesday.\u00a0 \"It's an important step forward in our plan for New Zealand to be carbon neutral by 2050. The public sector needs to be and will be an exemplar that sets the standard we all need to achieve by 2050.\" The policy sits alongside the Government's declaration of a climate emergency and \"serves as a message to the public sector to get our own house in order\", Ardern said.\u00a0 \"It's also a call to action for the private sector and it's great to see so many examples of businesses taking steps to reduce their emissions.\" Climate Change Minister James Shaw said achieving carbon neutrality across the public sector by 2025 will build on the progress the Government made over the last three years to transition New Zealand to net-zero carbon emissions. \"According to the world's leading scientists, we have just over nine years left to cut carbon emissions in half. This new initiative shows that the Government is equal to the challenge ahead,\" Shaw said.\u00a0 Since 1990, New Zealand's gross emissions have increased by 24 percent, according to the Ministry for the Environment. The agriculture and energy sectors contributed the most to emissions at 47.8 percent and 40.5 percent of gross emissions in 2018.\u00a0 The Government has already banned new offshore oil and gas exploration and established the Climate Change Commission which will advise governments on how to meet targets set in the Zero Carbon Act passed in 2019.\u00a0 The targets include zero net carbon emissions by 2050 and a reduction of between 24 and 47 percent of methane emissions by 2050. These targets are intended to keep global warming to within 1.5C by 2050. Labour's climate change policies include phasing out coal-fired boilers and decarbonising public transport buses, preventing unnecessary waste by phasing out single-use and hard to recycle plastics, and supporting agricultural climate change research.\u00a0 Electric vehicles only make about 0.3 percent of New Zealand's vehicle fleet. Labour's coalition agreement with New Zealand First in 2017 included a commitment to make the Government's vehicle fleet to become emissions-free by 2025/26, but as of June 14, just 108 cars in its fleet were electric. \"There are nearly 16,000 vehicles in the Government fleet and more than 200 coal-fired boilers currently heating water and buildings in the State Sector. So there is room for improvement,\" said Economic and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash.\u00a0 He said in the last term of Government the focus was on the charging infrastructure necessary to support the uptake of electric vehicles.\u00a0 Labour also plans to accelerate the uptake of low emission vehicles by progressively increasing funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority's Low Emission Vehicles Contestable Fund.\u00a0 The fund offers $6 million a year to co-fund projects in areas where commercial returns aren't yet strong enough to justify full private investment and around 163 projects have been approved by $27 million in Government funding.\u00a0 The fund has supported trials of electric trucks and buses, vehicle-to-home charging systems, and has enabled more than 100 electric vehicle chargers to be rolled out across New Zealand.\u00a0 Labour also wants to introduce a vehicle fuel efficiency standard, which would only apply to the new and used vehicles entering New Zealand and not the re-sale of existing ones, which account for 74 percent of annual vehicle sales.\u00a0 The Government announced in July 2019 it had reached a consensus with the agriculture sector on the need to implement pricing on emissions from 2025.\u00a0 It was then decided in October 2019 that farmers would be given five years to develop practical ways to measure and price emissions at the farm-level, to be separate from the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).\u00a0 Agriculture will be included in the ETS if an alternative isn't figured out by 2025. But either way, farmers would get a 95 percent discount - despite agriculture making up about half of New Zealand's reported emissions.\u00a0", "headline": "Climate change emergency: How the Government plans to make public sector carbon neutral by 2025", "article_name": "climate-change-emergency-how-the-government-plans-to-make-public-sector-carbon-neutral-by-2050", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/12/climate-change-emergency-how-the-government-plans-to-make-public-sector-carbon-neutral-by-2050.html", "date_published": "2020-12-02 15:00:22", "article_length": 4881, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:07.152655"}

She'll be meeting with a number of world leaders on the sides, including Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The gathering comes after millions worldwide took to the streets to protest a lack of progress on climate change. Scientists this week warned the pace of warming is speeding up, and current efforts are only about a third of what needs to be done to avoid catastrophic consequences in the decades to come.

I wouldn't be surprised if it does, but I imagine we'll talk about a number of things - even though we have a short 20 minutes together... I'm careful not to predetermine or pre-script some of the conversations that we have.

What we need to start encouraging is even if we're not seeing politicians moving, we need to make sure we find ways that we can achieve those goals regardless.\" The primary focus instead will be trade.\u00a0 \"We are trying to make sure we've got resilience for our exporters by widening up the number of free trade agreements New Zealand has,\" Ardern said.\u00a0 \"After they pulled out of the CPTPP, that has meant that we weren't able to pursue a free-trade agenda.

That's because of course protecting the ability to study as skilled migrants is something we've never been complacent about. That'll continue to be the case after Brexit.\u00a0 \"We do want to protect the existing right New Zealanders have to both take a holiday and have their OE in the UK, but also to stay on as skilled migrants.\" Negotiations for a new agreement with the European Union are already underway. \"Free-trade agreements obviously take quite some time to negotiate, so the sooner the start, the further down the track we can get.\"\u00a0 Newshub. \u00a0", "headline": "Jacinda Ardern has no plans to confront Donald Trump on climate change at Tuesday's meeting", "article_name": "jacinda-ardern-has-no-plans-to-confront-donald-trump-on-climate-change-at-tuesday-s-meeting", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/09/jacinda-ardern-has-no-plans-to-confront-donald-trump-on-climate-change-at-tuesday-s-meeting.html", "date_published": "2019-09-23 12:19:58", "article_length": 3712, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:07.468151"}

It looked at more than 100 pieces of research and policy analysis to work out how environmental conditions are affecting people's health. Global Health Alliance Australia executive director Misha Coleman was shocked by fact the research suggested an effect on children's IQ. Studies on the subject found evidence the change is due to stress hormones from the mother crossing into the placenta. One study found specific effects in children that went through the 2011 Brisbane floods, which was part of a cluster of floods in Queensland from 2010 to 2011. \"It's been estimated that those kids lost about 14 IQ points because of the stress their mothers went through,\" Coleman told AAP. The study also revealed higher temperatures and greenhouse gasses are leading to increased asthma attacks and allergies. Coleman said sometimes it could be hard for people to understand the broader implications of climate change on health. \"During the Black Saturday fires for example, people know about how many people died in the fires,\" she told AAP. \"But over those days, we had like 43 degree temperatures, there were an additional 374 deaths from heatstroke, because there is a relationship with heart failure and other sorts of underlying diseases that are massively exacerbated.\" Newshub.", "headline": "Children born with lower IQ due to climate change, report suggests", "article_name": "children-born-with-lower-iq-due-to-climate-change-report-suggests", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2019/07/children-born-with-lower-iq-due-to-climate-change-report-suggests.html", "date_published": "2019-07-31 12:19:28", "article_length": 1651, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:07.665054"}

Credits: Video - Newshub Nation; Image - Getty Warning: This story deals with suicide.\u00a0 Climate change might not just kill people through heat waves and stronger storms - it could result in more suicides, assaults, car crashes and drownings,  new research has found. Scientists in the US looked at data from 1980 to 2017 on temperatures and injury deaths, and found \"deaths due to drowning and transport injuries, and, to a lesser extent, assault and suicide, increased in unusually warm months, offset by a modest decrease in falls\". If the world manages to keep warming to 1.5C - as the Paris Agreement aims to - that would still result in an extra 1600 deaths every month in the US alone, they say. That rises to 2135 at warming of 2C. Most of the extra dead - 84 percent - would be men, and 92 percent of them aged between 15 and 64. \"It has been argued that other health effects associated with rising temperatures may, to some extent, be balanced by gains that result from less cold weather,\" an accompanying editorial written by Shanthi Ameratunga \u200aand Alistair Woodward of the University of Auckland's School of Population Health, and published in journal  Nature Medicine , said. \"However, the adverse effects on injury were offset only by a relatively modest reduction in falls in warmer months, conceivably due to lower risks of slipping on icy surfaces.\" As for what's behind the increase in deaths, the study authors propose: A  poll in 2018  found Millennials are suffering from 'eco-anxiety', with many more of them concerned about the state of the planet than older generations. Last year, School Strike 4 Climate New Zealand organiser Sophie Handford  told Newshub  she finds herself randomly bursting into tears and struggling with daily tasks, she's so worried about the future. \"If I sit down and watch a Netflix show or go for a run, I just feel like well maybe if I had spent that hour doing something important like climate strike organising then we might have a better chance of survival for those generations to come.\" The world has warmed more than 1C since the Industrial Revolution, when fossil fuels started being burned in large amounts. Scientists have warned if emissions aren't curbed soon, the world faces possibly devastating effects, such as droughts, stronger storms and unstoppable wildfires, such as those burning in Australia this summer. \"A combination of public health interventions that broadly target injuries in these groups - for example, targeted messaging for younger males on the risks of transport injury and drowning - and those that trigger in relation to forecast high-temperature periods - for example, additional targeted blood alcohol level checks - should be a public health priority,\" the researchers conclude. The study , like the editorial, was published in  Nature Medicine  on Tuesday. \u00a0", "headline": "Climate change could result in more car crashes and suicides - study", "article_name": "climate-change-could-result-in-more-car-crashes-and-suicides-study", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/01/climate-change-could-result-in-more-car-crashes-and-suicides-study.html", "date_published": "2020-01-14 05:11:45", "article_length": 2963, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:07.942816"}
{"id": null, "body": "By Karl Malakunas and Catherine Hours The years-long quest for a universal pact to avert catastrophic climate change has neared the finish line with a draft agreement completed in Paris. After nearly two weeks of tough haggling between bureaucrats and ministers from around the world, French and UN officials have completed a line-by-line edit of an historic agreement that seeks to slow global warming and ease its impacts. \"We have a text to present,\" an official in the office of Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who presides over the 195-nation talks, said. After translation into the UN's six official languages, the document will be handed to ministers including Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop later tonight (NZT), nearly 16 hours after the crunch conference was originally scheduled to close. It was hoped the text will be adopted at a special session on Saturday. Fabius said Friday he was \"sure\" the project would succeed. \"Everything is in place to achieve a universal, ambitious accord,\" said the man in charge of delivering the first-ever pact to bind all nations to climate action. \"Never again will we have a more favourable momentum than in Paris.\" World powers have led an overtime push for a deal as sleep-deprived envoys battled in Paris to unlock deep-seated disputes about who must do what to confront climate change. Many have billed the talks as the last chance to avert worst-case-scenario climate change effects: increasingly severe droughts, floods and storms, as well as rising seas that would engulf islands and populated coasts. The agreement would seek to revolutionise the world's energy system by cutting back or potentially eliminating coal and other fossil fuels, replacing them with renewable sources such as solar and wind. The Paris talks have largely been free of the fierce arguments that plagued previous UN climate conferences. The Chinese delegation's deputy chief Liu Zhenmin said he was \"quite confident\" a deal would be sealed on Saturday. Developing nations insist rich countries must shoulder the lion's share of responsibility for tackling climate change as they have emitted most of the greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution. But the United States and other rich nations say emerging giants must also do more. They argue that developing countries now account for most of today's emissions and thus will be largely responsible for future warming. One of the deepest disagreements is about funding the climate fight - at a cost of trillions of dollars over the decades to come. Rich countries promised six years ago in Copenhagen to muster US$100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing nations make the energy shift and cope with the impacts of global warming. But how the funds will be raised is unclear - and developing countries demand a commitment to increase the amount after 2020, when the pact enters into force.

{"id": null, "body": "\n By Seth Borenstein Leaked documents from a prominent conservative think tank show how it sought to teach schoolchildren scepticism about global warming and planned other behind-the-scenes tactics using millions of dollars in donations from big corporate names. More than US$14 million of the money used by the Chicago-based Heartland Institute would come from one anonymous man, according to the leaked documents prepared for a meeting of the group's board. Heartland is one of the loudest voices denying man-made global warming, hosting the largest international scientific conference of sceptics on climate change. Several of its documents were leaked this week to the news media, showing the planning and money behind its efforts. Heartland said some of the documents weren't accurate, but declined to be more specific. As detailed in the papers, Heartland's plans for this year included paying an Energy Department consultant $100,000 to design a curriculum to teach school children that mainstream global warming science is in dispute, even though it's a fact accepted by the federal government and nearly every scientific professional organization. It also pays prominent global warming sceptics more than $300,000 a year and plans to raise $88,000 to help a former television weatherman set up a new temperature records website. \"The stolen documents appear to have been written by Heartland's president for a board meeting that took place on January 17,\" Heartland said in a statement. \"The authenticity of those documents has not been confirmed.\" The institute singled out one of the six documents - claiming to be a summary of efforts on the issue of global warming - as a fake. Because Heartland was not specific about what was fake and what was real, The Associated Press attempted to verify independently key parts of separate budget and fundraising documents that were leaked. The federal consultant working on the classroom curriculum, the former TV weatherman, a Chicago elected official who campaigns against hidden local debt and two corporate donors all confirmed to the AP that the sections in the document that pertained to them were accurate. No one the AP contacted said the budget or fundraising documents mentioning them were incorrect. David Wojick, a Virginia-based federal database contractor, said in an email that the document was accurate about his project to put curriculum materials in schools that promote climate scepticism. \"My goal is to help them teach one of the greatest scientific debates in history,\" Wojick said. \"This means teaching both sides of the science, more science, not less.\" Five government and university climate scientists contacted said they were most disturbed by Wojick's project, fearing the teaching would be more propaganda rooted in politics than peer-reviewed science. Businesses and other interests often offer free curriculum materials to financially strapped schools, hoping that teachers will use them and help disseminate their views or promote their products. Energy Department spokeswoman Jen Stutsman said Wojick's federal work has nothing to do with climate change and that the agency maintains that global warming is real and manmade. Heartland also planned to spend $210,000 to help Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas tour the nation to speak about municipal debt, according to one document. Pappas lost to Barack Obama in the 2004 Democratic primary for a US Senate seat. Pappas confirmed this in a phone interview, saying what Heartland was doing was exposing a \"financial tsunami\" of municipal debt. The leaked document also discusses a new million-dollar Heartland initiative to promote the ability of patients to use experimental drugs that have not yet received federal safety approval, and efforts to support embattled Wisconsin Republican leaders in \"Operation Angry Badger\". Those parts of the documents were not independently confirmed. The documents also show Heartland has raised more than $2 million from large insurance companies and nearly half a million dollars from tobacco interests. A person who emailed 15 media and bloggers as \"Heartland insider\" sent six different documents purporting to be from the libertarian think tank. The insider then killed the email account used to send the documents and could not be reached. Heartland spokesman Jim Lakely would not confirm or deny the claims made in the five documents that he did not call fake. The most sensational parts of the documents - and much of what has been confirmed independently - had to do with global warming and efforts to spread doubt into what mainstream scientists are saying. Experts long have thought Heartland and other groups were working to muddy the waters about global warming, said Harry Lambright, a Syracuse University public policy professor who specializes in environment, science and technology issues. \"Scientifically there is no controversy. Politically, there is a controversy because there are political interest groups making it a controversy,\" Lambright said. \"It's not about science. It's about politics. To some extent they are winning the battle.\" A 2010 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences surveyed more than 1,300 most cited and published climate scientists and found that 97 percent of them said climate change was a man-made problem. Yet, public opinion polls show far more doubt in the American public. An environmental advocacy group, Forecast the Facts, on Thursday started a petition and social media campaign to complain to two of Heartland's corporate donors listed on the documents, Microsoft and General Motors. The two were not the biggest donors; Microsoft donated $69,000 over three years, while the General Motors Foundation gave $45,000. But those are companies that \"need to hear from their customers\" that they are not happy about promoting climate scepticism, especially after General Motors got a government bailout, campaign director Daniel Souweine said. General Motors spokesman Greg Martin said the company's foundation gives money to \"a variety of different groups holding a variety of opinions\". Microsoft said through its public relations agency that it donates software to 44,000 nonprofits that pass IRS standards, as Heartland does, and that it considers climate change a serious issue. The documents showed how heavily Heartland relies on a single person it identified only as \"Anonymous Donor.\" In the past six years, the man has given $14.26 million to the institute, nearly half its $33.9 million in revenue.

{"id": null, "body": "Oxfam's Rachael Le Mesurier talks about the big climate report on The AM Show.  Credits: Video - The AM Show; Images - Getty Images/NASA A 1980s environmental pact once dubbed the \"single most successful international agreement to date\" might have unintentionally given us an extra decade or two to fight climate change,  a new study has found. Last week, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report saying we're on track to hit 1.5C of warming by 2030, increasing the risk of the climate reaching irreversible tipping points if we don't slash emissions immediately. But we might already have reached \"scorched earth\" if it weren't for a global deal to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons - used in aerosol cans and refrigerators - signed way back in 1987.\u00a0 The intent of the  Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer  - to use its full name - was to save the ozone layer, which protects life on Earth from damaging UV rays. The success of the agreement - dropping use of ozone-depleting substances by 99.7 percent - has led scientists to predict the layer will have recovered by the mid-21st century. Former head of the UN Kofi Annan  called it  \"perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date\".\u00a0 The  protocol's text  doesn't actually mention climate change or global warming - but it was later found that CFCs were a potent greenhouse (GHG), thousands of times more so than even carbon dioxide. Researchers in 2019 estimated the Montreal Protocol had done  eight times more to slow down global warming than 1997's warming-focused Kyoto Protocol , saving us 1C by 2050. But the cooling effect might be even bigger than that. A new study involving scientists from the US, UK and New Zealand has found the UV rays that would have reached the Earth's surface if the Montreal Protocol never happened would have badly damaged plants' ability to store carbon dioxide. Without Montreal, their modelling shows the ozone layer would have largely collapsed by 2040, particularly over the tropics where much of the world's vegetation is.\u00a0 \"Increased UV would have stopped plants being able to soak up so much carbon from the atmosphere which would have led to greater global warming,\" said Olaf Morgenstern, atmospheric scientist at New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA).\u00a0 Thanks to this, by the end of the century there would be 580 billion tonnes more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the scientists calculated - about 13 years' worth of current global carbon dioxide emissions. Concentrations in the atmosphere would be up an extra 215 parts per million, about 50 percent more than what there already is, resulting in another 0.8C of warming on top of the  increased risk of skin cancers.\u00a0 \"Without the protocol human health would have been severely impacted and UV would be catastrophic for vegetation.\" The study found the warming effect of the continued use of CFCs would have added another 1.7C to global temperatures too, all up resulting in 2.5C of warming on top of the influence of other GHGs like carbon dioxide and methane.\u00a0 CFCs were replaced with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are also being phased out - while they're much better for the ozone layer, they also  contribute to warming much more strongly than carbon dioxide . Some scientists have even suggested  replacing both with carbon dioxide itself , saying it's a much weaker GHG and leaves the ozone layer alone. An amendment to the Montreal Protocol phasing out HFCs is expected to save another 0.5C of potential warming by 2100.\u00a0 The latest study was  published Thursday in  Nature .\u00a0", "headline": "Banning CFCs to save the ozone layer might have prevented 'scorched earth' level of global warming - study", "article_name": "banning-cfcs-to-save-the-ozone-layer-might-have-prevented-scorched-earth-level-of-global-warming-study", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2021/08/banning-cfcs-to-save-the-ozone-layer-might-have-prevented-scorched-earth-level-of-global-warming-study.html", "date_published": "2021-08-19 05:19:28", "article_length": 3658, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:08.864941"}

The intruders pose a risk to New Zealand's agriculture industry, and are the main reason visitors can't bring fruit and vegetables into the country.\u00a0 O'Connor told Newshub Nation on Saturday officials had to be sure of the risk posed by the find on July 15 before making the details public. \"We have to double-check that indeed it's a fruit fly, where it's from and whether it's only one.\" Fruit flies aren't normally found this late in the year. \"The issue here is that normally in the winter, they'd be in hibernation.

{"id": null, "body": "Related video: What New Zealanders have to change and when to help stop climate change.   Credits: Image - Getty; Video - Newshub Nation By Robert McLachlan for The Conversation New Zealanders are polarised on climate change policy, according to a recent survey.\u00a0 This puts the two major political parties in a difficult position as they seek options that are credible yet appealing to voters. Just 30 percent of Labour voters and 22 percent of National voters think the country is \"more or less on the right path\" on climate action, according to a Stuff/Massey University survey of 55,000 readers.\u00a0 The majority of voters on one side of the political spectrum wants to see \"urgent action and radical change\", while at the other end most recommend caution and scepticism. The survey helps explain the deep distrust climate advocates have for the National Party, and their demands for bolder choices from Labour. Labour is running heavily on its record, including the passing of the Zero Carbon Act and the introduction of a falling cap on emissions permits issued under the Emissions Trading Scheme. Although the government's COVID-19 recovery spending has been criticised for not being green enough, Labour seems aligned with a \"just transition\" approach championed by the International Labour Organisation. Labour's climate headline policy is for 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030, five years earlier than planned, and to spend NZ$100 million developing a pumped hydro scheme. Labour is also sticking with a plan for a nationwide fuel efficiency standard, which would begin to turn around New Zealand's growing transport emissions. The party has dropped the electric car rebate, which the National Party has attacked on the grounds it could increase the price of popular vehicles. A similar approach worked for the Australian Liberal Party in 2019. The Green Party would go further. While also promising 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030, the party promotes home solar and insulation and community clean energy. More boldly, it would immediately ban new fossil-fuelled industrial boilers and end industrial coal use by 2030 and gas by 2035. It would prioritise free public transport for under-18s, ban petrol car imports from 2030 and create a NZ$1.5 billion cycleway fund. The National Party has released its electric vehicle policy, with a target of 80,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2023 (up from 16,000 now). It would exempt these vehicles from fringe benefit tax until 2025 and from road user charges until at least 2023 to encourage uptake by commercial fleets. It would also target a third of government vehicles to be electric by 2023 and allow electric vehicles to use bus and carpool lanes. The last point has been criticised for impeding the flow of buses. On the other hand, National's climate spokesperson, Scott Simpson, has called the party a \"broad church\" and pledged to amend the Zero Carbon Act to emphasise that food production should not be sacrificed for climate goals. The ACT Party, which on current polling would increase from one to ten MPs, was the only party to oppose the Zero Carbon Act. It now proposes repealing the act and tying the price of carbon to that of New Zealand's five top trading partners. At the time of New Zealand's last general election in September 2017, Extinction Rebellion and the School Strike 4 Climate movements did not yet exist. Greta Thunberg was unknown to the world. Now climate activism has increased globally. Climate-change impacts, including temperature records of 38\u2103 in northern Siberia to 54\u2103 in Death Valley, have attracted widespread attention. Orange skies in San Francisco are a reminder of apocalyptic Australian bushfires less than a year ago. There are also signs of bolder climate action that may fulfil the declarations of the Paris Agreement. In the European Union, negotiations are under way to cut 2030 emissions to 40-45 percent of 1990 levels. This target would require halving emissions in the next decade. In the US, the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, has a US$2 trillion proposal for rapid decarbonisation. Ireland's new government has agreed to emission cuts of 7 percent per year. China has pledged to be carbon-neutral before 2060. In New Zealand, both Auckland and Wellington councils have released highly ambitious climate plans that will require sweeping changes to housing and transport. But this year's New Zealand general election won't be about climate change. The COVID-19 crisis and the high level of uncertainty about economic recovery and employment have made issues of leadership, trust and party branding more important than ever. In this context, Labour's nod to the Lake Onslow pumped hydro project could be a winner. Its storage potential is enormous - more than all of New Zealand's present hydro lakes combined and 15 times the size of Australia's Snowy 2.0 project. It could decarbonise not just all electricity generation, but a lot of industrial process heat and transport as well. It would address the seasonal imbalance between lake inflows and electricity demand, and protect against dry years. But it's also a traditional civil engineering project far in the future and doesn't threaten anybody's lifestyle today. In New Zealand, as elsewhere, climate politics means finding support for actions now whose benefits extend far into the future.

Credits: Image - Getty; Video - Newshub Finance Minister Grant Robertson has hinted at climate change spending and cost-cutting in what's been described as the Recovery Budget. In a pre-Budget speech on Tuesday, Robertson said he asked each minister to look again at the areas of COVID-19 spending for which they were responsible to see if it costs could be cut. It resulted in $926 million - almost $1 billion - worth of savings. \"We have committed to only spending what we need to in terms of our response and recovery. I am pleased that we have found these savings, and that they can be returned to the fund to aid our recovery from COVID-19 and targeted to where it is needed the most.\" Robertson said this year's Budget - to be announced on May 20 - will focus on \"striking a careful balance\" between continuing to invest in New Zealand's economic recovery but also reducing debt taken on during COVID-19. Treasury's update last month, where the Government's books were opened up, showed we're now more than $100 billion in debt, representing 32.6 percent of GDP, a comparison of what the Government owes with what it produces. How does the debt compare to pre-COVID times? In February 2020, Government debt was at $59.7 billion, representing just 19.5 percent of GDP. It means in the space of one year, debt increased by 73 percent because of COVID-19. Debt is tipped to reach $190 billion by 2025 - 46.9 percent of GDP. Robertson said the Government's focus continues to be keeping Kiwis safe from COVID-19 and addressing the \"big three foundational challenges\": housing affordability, climate change and child wellbeing.\u00a0 But getting that huge debt mountain down is equally as important. Robertson said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has tasked him with leading a new unit within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to make sure spending is going in the right places, and \"ensure we are tackling these core priorities\". \"At a time where the Government is playing a much greater role in supporting the economy and investing for the future, it is crucial that we ensure that we are getting value for money from every dollar of spending, and that across the public service initiatives are being delivered in a way that supports our economic recovery.\" The Government in March announced a  $3.8 billion housing infrastructure fund, alongside a package of housing initiatives , to address both demand and supply issues. Social Development Minister Carmel Sepuloni also hinted at an increase to welfare,  speaking to Newshub Nation .\u00a0 Robertson said while the Government aims to be careful with money, being too careful \"runs the risk of undermining the recovery\". \"A turn to austerity measures will simply mean it takes longer for us to rebuild society in pursuit of numerical goals that ignore the real world we are living in. It is all about getting the balance right, which we have shown through the COVID period that we can do,\" he said. \"We will move to reduce debt and return to surplus as a responsible Government should, but not at the expense of our people or the hard won stability and security from our COVID response.\" Robertson hinted at more Government spending on climate change initiatives, to meet the  draft recommendations of the Independent Climate Commission . The Government must have set the first three emissions budgets out to 2035 and released its first emissions reduction plan, by December 31. \"Almost every sector of our economy is affected by the carbon budgets that have been outlined by the Climate Commission,\" Robertson said. \"I will have more to say at Budget time about our approach to meeting the targets we have set, but we will continue to look for not just the measures we must take to reduce emissions but the possibilities and opportunities that exist to create high paying and sustainable jobs as we make that transition.\" \u00a0", "headline": "Finance Minister Grant Robertson hints at climate change spending, cost-cutting in 'Recovery Budget'  ", "article_name": "finance-minister-grant-robertson-hints-at-climate-change-spending-cost-cutting-in-recovery-budget", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2021/05/finance-minister-grant-robertson-hints-at-climate-change-spending-cost-cutting-in-recovery-budget.html", "date_published": "2021-05-04 08:10:04", "article_length": 3922, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:09.443629"}

It's a gloomier scenario than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has put forward, they say; but being based on real-world historical data, sadly perhaps more accurate.\u00a0 \"Climate skeptics have argued that global warming projections are unreliable because they depend on faulty supercomputer models,\" said Bruno Tremblay, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at McGill University and co-author of  a new study looking at the future state of the climate. \"While these criticisms are unwarranted, they underscore the need for independent and different approaches to predicting future warming.\" Dr Tremblay and his team developed a new climate model they say produces similar results to the IPCC's models, but is about twice as accurate and relies on fewer assumptions. The threshold for 1.5C of warming will be passed sometime between 2027 and 2042, they say - depending on what actions humanity takes. The IPCC's estimate is 2052. Under a best-case scenario, where emissions are phased out by 2100, the world has an 80 percent chance of keeping temperature rises below 1.5C this century, and a 97 percent chance of keeping it below 2C. In the middle scenario - emissions rising to 2050, then falling to about half that level by 2100 - it's almost certain we'll pass 1.5C mid-century, and 94 percent likelihood of breaching 2K by 2100. The third scenario - emissions keep rising through the 21st century - the 1.5C threshold will be breached in the 2030s or 2040s, and 2C in the 2050s.\u00a0 \"Now that governments have finally decided to act on climate change, we must avoid situations where leaders can claim that even the weakest policies can avert dangerous consequences,\" said co-author Shaun Lovejoy, also of McGill University.\u00a0 \"With our new climate model and its next generation improvements, there's less wiggle room.\" The researchers admit their model has a weakness, but it's not one anyone should be placing hope in. \"It assumes a linear stationary relationship between [climate influences] and temperature, neglecting nonlinear interactions which could arise as the system evolves, as it currently warms,\" the study reads. \"In particular, so-called tipping points could be reached in the coming century which would lead to a breakdown of the linear model proposed.\" Prior studies have outlined some potential feedback loops, for example the melting of polar ice - large white areas reflect heat back into space, and without them, the Earth absorbs more energy and warming speeds up.\u00a0 The latest study was published in journal  Climate Dynamics .", "headline": "Climate change: New study says 'dangerous' temperatures will be here sooner than we think", "article_name": "climate-change-new-study-says-dangerous-temperatures-will-be-here-sooner-than-we-think", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/12/climate-change-new-study-says-dangerous-temperatures-will-be-here-sooner-than-we-think.html", "date_published": "2020-12-23 14:03:48", "article_length": 2784, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:09.804995"}

That has to change, and we need to take responsibly and lead that change,\" Goff said. \"Contrary to what my opponent says, there is no war on cars, but there is one on the congestion that hinders people from getting around the city, and on pollution. \"Clean transport is a key part to tackling our climate change and environmental challenges, as well as making our city a better place to live.

Credits:  Video - The AM Show; Images - Getty Images The United States and the European Union have agreed to aim to cut emissions of the planet-warming gas methane by around a third by the end of this decade and are pushing other major economies to join them, according to documents seen by Reuters. Their pact comes as Washington and Brussels seek to galvanize other major economies ahead of a  world summit to address climate change in Glasgow , Scotland, in November, and could have a significant impact on the energy, agriculture and waste industries responsible for the  bulk of methane emissions . The greenhouse gas methane, the biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide (CO2), is facing more scrutiny as governments seek solutions to limit global warming to 1.5C, a goal of the Paris climate agreement. In an attempt to jumpstart the action, the United States and the EU later this week will make a joint pledge to reduce human-caused methane emissions by at least 30 percent by 2030, compared with 2020 levels, according to a draft of the Global Methane Pledge seen by Reuters. \"The short atmospheric lifetime of methane means that taking action now can rapidly reduce the rate of global warming,\" the draft said. A separate document listed over two dozen countries that the United States and the EU will target to join the pledge. They include major emitters such as China, Russia, India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, as well as others including Norway, Qatar, Britain, New Zealand and South Africa. The US State Department declined to comment and the European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the documents. The agreement would likely be unveiled on Friday at a meeting of major emitting economies intended to rally support ahead of the COP26 Glasgow summit. World leaders are under pressure from scientists, environmental advocates and growing popular sentiment to commit to more ambitious action to curb climate change in Glasgow. Methane has a higher heat-trapping potential than CO2 but it breaks down in the atmosphere faster, so \"strong, rapid and sustained reductions\" in methane emissions in addition to slashing CO2 emissions can have a climate impact quickly, a fact emphasized by a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last month. Experts say the fossil fuel sector has the biggest potential to cut methane emissions this decade by mending leaky pipelines or gas storage facilities, and many of those fixes can be done at a low cost. Yet satellite images and infrared footage have in recent years revealed methane emissions spewing out of oil and gas sites in countries including the  EU ,  Mexico  and the  United States. The United States and EU are both due to propose laws this year to restrict methane emissions. The US-EU pledge would cover key sources of methane emissions, including leaky oil and gas infrastructure, old coal mines, agriculture and waste such as landfills, the draft said. Countries that join the pledge would commit to take domestic action to collectively achieve the target methane cut, \"focusing on standards to achieve all feasible reductions in the energy and waste sectors\" and reducing agricultural emissions through \"technology innovation as well as incentives and partnerships with farmers,\" it said.

{"id": null, "body": "In 80 years time, your favourite summer holiday spot could be underwater. New research says half of the world's beaches are under threat.  Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images By  John Church  for  The Conversation For many coastal regions, sea-level rise is a looming crisis threatening our coastal society, livelihoods and coastal ecosystems.  A new study , published in Nature Climate Change, has reported the world will lose almost half of its valuable sandy beaches by 2100 as the ocean moves landward with rising sea levels. Sandy beaches comprise about a third of the world's coastline. And Australia, with nearly 12,000 kilometres at risk, could be hit hard. This is the first truly global study to attempt to quantify beach erosion. The results for the highest greenhouse gas emission scenario are alarming, but reducing emissions led to lower rates of coastal erosion. Our best hope for the future of the world's coastlines and for Australia's iconic beaches is to keep global warming as low as possible by urgently reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two of the largest problems resulting from  rising sea levels  are coastal erosion and an already-observed increase in the frequency of coastal flooding events. Erosion during storms can have dramatic consequences, particularly for coastal infrastructure. We saw this in 2016, when  wild storms  removed sand from beaches and damaged houses in Sydney. After storms like this, beaches often gradually recover, because sand from deeper waters washes back to the shore over months to years and in some cases decades. These dramatic storms and the long-term  sand supply  make it difficult to identify any beach movement in the recent past from sea-level rise. What we do know is that the rate of sea-level rise has  accelerated . It has increased by half since 1993, and is continuing to accelerate from ongoing greenhouse gas emissions. If we continue to emit high levels of greenhouse gases, this acceleration will continue through the 21st century and  beyond . As a result, the supply of sand may not be able to keep pace with rapidly rising sea levels. In the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  report , released last year, the highest greenhouse gas emissions scenario resulted in global warming of more than 4C (relative to pre-industrial temperatures) and a likely range of sea-level rise between 0.6 and 1.1 metres by 2100. For this scenario, this new study projects a global average landward movement of the coastline in the range of 40 to 250 metres if there were no physical limits to shoreline movement, such as those imposed by sea walls or other coastal infrastructure. Sea-level rise is responsible for the vast majority of this beach loss, with faster loss during the latter decades of the 21st century when the rate of rise is larger. And sea levels will continue to rise for centuries, so beach erosion would continue well after 2100. For southern Australia, the landward movement of the shoreline is projected to be more than 100 metres. This would damage many of Australia\u2019s iconic tourist beaches such as Bondi, Manly and the Gold Coast. The movement in northern Australia is projected to be even larger, but more uncertain because of ongoing historical shoreline trends. The above results are from a worst-case scenario. If greenhouse gas emissions were reduced such that the 2100 global temperature rose by about 2.5C, instead of more than 4C, then we'd reduce beach erosion by about a third of what\u2019s projected in this worst-case scenario. Current global policies would result in about  3C of global warming . That's between the 4C and the 2.5C scenarios considered in this beach erosion study, implying our current policies will lead to significant beach erosion, including in Australia. Mitigating our emissions even further to achieving the Paris goal of keeping temperature rise to well below 2C would be a major step in reducing beach loss. Projecting sea-level rise and resulting beach erosion are particularly difficult as both depend on many factors. For sea level, the major problems are estimating the contribution of melting Antarctic ice flowing into the ocean, how sea level will change on a regional scale, and the amount of global warming. The beach erosion calculated in this new study depends on several new databases. The databases of recent shoreline movement used to project ongoing natural factors might already be influenced by rising sea levels, possibly leading to an overestimate in the final calculations. Regardless of the exact numbers reported in this study, it's clear we will have to adapt to the beach erosion that we can no longer prevent, if we are to continue enjoying our beaches. This means we need appropriate planning, such as beach nourishment (adding sand to beaches to combat erosion) and other soft and hard engineering solutions. In some cases, we'll even need to retreat from the coast to allow the beach to migrate landward. And if we are to continue to enjoy our sandy beaches into the future, we cannot allow ongoing and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The world needs urgent, significant and sustained global mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.

Andrew Hoggard of Federated Farmers says farmers are unsure of what they actually need to achieve. \"There's quite a few messages coming through, and you're not quite sure what the amount is and what is the target,\" he said. That's because for a long time, methane has been treated differently because it's a short-lived gas.

It's the opposite of what's happening in the rest of the world. Ice in the Arctic is retreating fast, and we're cracking temperature records on a monthly basis. But after decades of warming, measurements taken on the Antarctic Peninsula - the continent's most northern part - have recorded cooling. The study,\u00a0 published in  Nature , says it's a result of \"natural variability\" in the climate. Despite the cooling, temperatures in Antarctica are still warmer than in the middle of the 20th century, so the ice is still melting and glaciers are continuing to retreat.

It doesn't change the current curriculum, but aims to make it easier for teachers to do their job. The Opposition has expressed concern over some of its contents, particularly information on the meat industry's environmental impacts and what to do with students who express scepticism about humans' impact on global temperatures, which  have been rising for decades .\u00a0 National Party deputy leader Paula Bennett on Monday told Magic Talk the Government has failed to make it clear that not all teachers will use the voluntary resource. \"There are a number of parents that are upset about how it's going to be handled,\" she told host Peter Williams, who himself  has called the scientific consensus - that humans are causing climate change - \"nonsense\".\u00a0 \"This is voluntary,\" Bennett continued. \"Climate change being taught in our schools is not necessarily a bad thing - it is about our future and young people need to understand it better.

New Zealand has a large agricultural sector, and numerous studies have shown it takes far more resources to produce meat than the equivalent amount of plant-based food, and the amount of emissions released is far greater. But New Zealand's agricultural industry is also highly efficient by international standards.  Some studies have found  it's more efficient to produce meat in New Zealand and ship it to the UK than it is to grow meat there. \"It's ridiculous. There's some absolute parts of it, and that's one of them,\" said Bennett. \"It's just feeding into the hype and hysteria without the research behind it.

Don't get me going on that one.\" A 2018 study, however, found  even the most environmentally-friendly meat was worse for the environment  than the most-damaging plant-based food. \"A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,\" lead researcher Joseph Poore of the University of Oxford told the  Guardian . It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car.\" Scientists recently announced  the 2010s  were the hottest decade on record . The hottest before that was the 2000s, and before that, the 1990s, the 1980s, the 1970s then 1960s - the clear message being that the world is getting hotter, and it's all down to emissions caused by burning fossil fuels and large-scale agriculture. If it continues , they warn sea levels could rise, storms will get stronger, wildfires harder to control and large parts of the world will experience droughts.\u00a0 But Bennett says kids the resource is aimed at - aged 11 to 14 - are \"smart\" and should be given the \"counterarguments\" to what the scientists claim. \"I think it's important that our kids are encouraged to the discourse of all of the different sides of it so they can make up their own minds. It certainly seems to me there is some misinformation through it - there will be controversy and I think the controversy should be embraced and let our young people decide and debate it themselves in the classroom. Not just teach it from one angle and one side, which is what this looks like.\" National  signed the Government's landmark Zero Carbon Bill , which aims to make New Zealand carbon-neutral by 2050.\u00a0 But the party has also vowed to overturn the near-total ban on new oil exploration, and  make amendments to the Zero Carbon Act - including reducing New Zealand's commitments to emissions reduction if other countries don't reduce theirs, and take more notice of economic impacts.", "headline": "National might withdraw climate change teaching resource ", "article_name": "national-might-withdraw-climate-change-teaching-resource", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/national-might-withdraw-climate-change-teaching-resource.html", "date_published": "2020-01-20 11:21:44", "article_length": 4885, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:11.774241"}

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images Antarctic melting could cause a \"dramatic\" rise in sea levels if countries fail to keep global warming below 2C (3.6 Fahrenheit), posing a serious threat to low-lying and coastal regions, researchers said on Wednesday. If the upper temperature goal set in the Paris Agreement is exceeded, the melting Antarctic ice sheet could cause annual average sea-level rise of 0.07 inches (0.18cm) globally in 2060 and beyond,  said the study published in the journal  Nature . Under the  2015 Paris Agreement , more than 190 countries agreed to hold global average temperature rise to \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial times and strive for a limit of 1.5C. Warming of 3C - a scenario that is more consistent with current policies - would push sea levels up by a \"catastrophic\" 0.2 inches (0.5cm) per year globally after 2060, the study added. Researchers used a model based on satellite observations, climate data and machine learning to predict the region's ice loss under different global policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions. \"Ice-sheet collapse is irreversible over thousands of years, and if the Antarctic ice sheet becomes unstable, it could continue to retreat for centuries,\" said co-author Daniel M. Gilford of the Rutgers Earth System Science & Policy Lab. \"That's regardless of whether emissions mitigation strategies such as removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are employed,\" he added in a statement. Low-lying nations like Bangladesh, which already suffers from extreme storms and floods, are most vulnerable to the impacts of rising temperatures and sea levels, said Atiq Rahman, head of the nonprofit Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies. In Bangladesh's flat southern area, \"a little increase in sea level transfers into a much bigger linear or horizontal increase of land cover by saltwater,\" explained Rahman, who was not involved in the study. \"Gradually, those who are now in (areas of) brackish water, which is saltwater plus fresh water, (their land) will become saline and their agricultural productivity will decrease.\" The result will be higher displacement, with people forced to move to urban areas already struggling to accommodate growing populations, where many will lead a poorer quality of life away from their families, Rahman said. Coastal communities are seeking to cope through simple measures like growing vegetables in pots away from saltwater, he noted. \"People are trying to adapt, but adaptation has limits,\" he added. A study published by the American Geophysical Union , an international scientific group, last month predicted that rising seas could trigger waves of migration across Bangladesh, affecting more than 1.3 million people by 2050. Both Gilford and Rahman stressed the need for greater international efforts to tackle rising global temperatures, ahead of the COP 26 UN climate talks in November. \"The only serious response from the global community is rapid decrease in greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Rahman.

{"id": null, "body": "Adapting to climate change is going to affect the way every New Zealander lives their lives, but it's often difficult to imagine exactly what these changes will look like. However, the UN has  warned  that we only have 12 years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels before it starts having devastating effects. Newshub Nation explores what will be different about how we get our energy, how we get around, how we shop, how we travel and what we eat. Energy: \n  The Government has set a  target  of being 100 percent renewable by 2035. Currently, 82 percent of  our energy  comes from renewable sources - mainly hydropower. The problem with renewables is their reliability. If the sun isn't shining, or if our lakes are low, or if the wind isn't blowing, our backup is burning fossil fuels like coal in power plants. However, these power plants could be converted to burn other less-carbon heavy products like waste-wood from forestry. \"We've obviously got lots of wood lying around and the problems we had in Tolaga Bay - you can imagine that would have been much better used as a source of energy if we'd had the supply chain set up,\" says James Shaw, Minister for Climate Change. Another potential solution to the storage problem is using renewable sources to produce hydrogen gas, which acts a bit like a battery. \"Hydrogen plants can make a lot of energy at short notice, and that's a really key capability that we need to push the last bit of coal and gas off the grid and get to 100 percent renewable,\" says Katherine Errington, Helen Clark Foundation executive director. Ms Errington says New Zealand could  produce and sell  green hydrogen to other countries like Japan if we maxed out our renewable energy generation. \"That's our edge, that's what we can offer. New Zealand has heaps of renewable generation that's already been consented and just isn't being built because no one wants to develop it.\" \n However, organisations like Solarcity want New Zealand to rely less on the grid all together. \"Batteries solve the [renewable] problem, and the accelerated rate that companies like ourselves and Tesla, and Panasonic are bringing forward battery solutions mean that you can now use that renewable energy at night when you need it the most,\" says Andrew Booth, Solarcity NZ CEO. Alongside generating more renewable energy, New Zealanders are also going to need to become more efficient. \"Insulation material placed in the ceiling and under the floor is a basic component that every house should have and also using cold water when doing the washing, turning off the lights when needed, using LED bulbs - all sorts of things that are well understood and recorded,\" says Professor Ralph Sims, Massey University climate scientist. Many homes in the North Island will also need to transition away from using natural gas for cooking and heating water. Natural gas has about half the emissions of coal and is often talked about as a transition fuel. However, it's estimated we only have about  10 years  worth of gas reserves left. \"We need to phase this out and what that means is actually, as a transition fuel, now is the transition and what we need to be doing is investing heavily in the alternatives,\" says Shaw. Transport: Transport accounts for 19 percent of the country's emissions, mainly because New Zealanders love their cars. We imported 319,662 light vehicles in 2018. Of that total, just 5,542 or 1.7 percent were electric or hybrid cars according to the Ministry of Transport. This needs to change and fast. By 2030, the  Productivity Commission  says 80 percent of NZ vehicle imports need to be electric and by 2050, nearly every vehicle will need to be electric. As at March 2019, electric vehicles (EVs) made up just 0.3 percent of our fleet. \"We swap out our cars on average about every 15 years so if you were to go out and buy a car today, then the next car you buy 15 years from now will have to be an electric,\" says James Shaw. \n The Climate Change Minister says the Government's long-promised electric cars policy is still being developed, with concern for low-income families behind the hold-up. Drive Electric's Mark Gilbert says the quickest way to get more EVs into the market would be through adjusting the fringe benefit tax, to incentivise businesses to transition their company fleets. \"Companies roll their fleets every two to three years so these vehicles will quickly end up in the second-hand market, which will make them more accessible,\" he says. Gilbert also suggests temporarily reducing GST on electric cars and a feebate scheme, where electric vehicle registrations are subsidised by higher fees for petrol and diesel vehicles An electric fleet will require a big change in infrastructure, with more charging ports around the country. It'll also mean greater reliance on walking, cycling and public transport. \"Most journeys in New Zealand are just two to three kilometres so you don't really need a car for that,\" says Ralph Sims. For trucks, trains, ships and planes, green hydrogen offers a potential climate-friendly solution. \"[Hydrogen] can offer a clean fuel option that's a lot more convenient than electrification,\" says Katherine Errington. \"For example with electric trucks, the time taken to charge those means the vehicle has to be out of service for that time and most truck companies have their fleets in near constant operation, but with a hydrogen truck you can refuel the same way you do a petrol or diesel truck.\" Air Travel: The main changes to air travel for the average New Zealander will be the heightened cost, which  UK research  has estimated will kick in around 2035. Aviation is one of the trickiest areas to reduce emissions. It  currently  produces about 859 million tonnes of carbon each year or around two percent of global emissions. However, by 2050 it is  expected  to emit more than any other sector. \n \n Currently, the main way that airline companies offset their emissions is through buying carbon credits which are used to plant trees. Air New Zealand has a voluntary  \"FlyNeutral\"  option that customers can select when booking their tickets. \"Forests are only a temporary measure but can offset air travel in the short term,\" says Ralph Sims. \"However, it's something that we can't keep doing and in the next 10 to 20 years we need to find substitutes for aviation fuels and reduce the demand for air travel.\" The Climate Change Minister is confident this will happen. \n \n\"[Air New Zealand] are doing things like looking at how to use biofuels as part of their aviation fuel mix, they're investing in electric aeroplane technology and I think I've heard Christopher Luxon (Air NZ CEO) say that within ten years some of the smaller regional planes will be battery powered,\" says James Shaw. The biggest problem is what to do about international flights, as there is no global agreement on how to put a price on these emissions. A  solution  put forward by the UK Climate Commission is having industries like aviation pay to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere. It estimates the cost of this at $20b-$40b in the year 2050, with that cost likely passed on to consumers. This means the price of flights will start to increase from 2035 as emission removals are predicted to scale up. Shopping: Online shopping can actually be better for the environment than traditional shopping, because it means people aren't driving their cars to and from the store. However,  US research  found online shopping is only better when consumers choose regular delivery rather than express shipping, which creates nearly 30 percent more emissions. \n \nThat's because delivery companies are forced to prioritise speed over efficiency. \n \"If we can get to the idea that we don't need that pair of running shoes immediately and we could wait for two or three weeks and therefore it's shipped across by boat from Australia [instead of by plane], and then it's put on a train and finally delivered to your home,\" says Ralph Sims. \"It's the expectations which are driving up the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from the internet shopping.\" Food: \n  \n This is probably the most controversial area to make changes, but with the world's food system accounting for  nearly a quarter  of all emissions it is one of the areas we need to adapt. By 2050, the average New Zealander will likely still be able to purchase meat and dairy, just at a higher cost, with the majority of what fills up our fridges likely to be plant based. In New Zealand, agriculture makes up  half  of our emissions - mainly from livestock  burping methane . This gas breaks down in the atmosphere after  12 years , unlike carbon, which can hang around for hundreds of years. However while it is shorter lived, methane is  25 times  stronger than carbon when it comes to warming. \"There are ways to try and reduce methane which are being researched - what you feed the animal on, how you breed the animals to produce less methane,\" says Ralph Sims.\u00a0\u00a0 \"But if we can increase the productivity [e.g. more milk from each cow] then that's a better alternative than having to reduce stock numbers.\" Sims also says that the potential of vegetable protein is something that New Zealand's agricultural sector should keep an eye on. \"Vegetable protein is being used to produce artificial meat, burgers, etc, that look like meat, smell like meat, taste like meat, but they're not meat and therefore they're healthier and have lower carbon footprints,\" he says. \n \n Already, 10 percent of New Zealanders are  estimated  to be vegetarian or vegan. \"As a Government we're not really in the business of telling people what they can and can't eat,\" says James Shaw. \"I do know that agricultural practises are changing and will change over time but they always have.\" What still needs to be figured out:\u00a0\u00a0 Under the Paris Agreement, New Zealand has committed to  targets  to reduce emissions. \n \n \nThe Zero Carbon Bill  establishes  an independent climate commission, which will give the Government advice on how to achieve them. The bill also commits New Zealand to new targets for carbon and methane over the next 30 years. \n However, even with these changes - it's unlikely global warming will be slowed without removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere with  new technology . One way of doing this is with trees. Plants absorb carbon as they grow. The  idea  is that we burn them, capture the carbon and store it underground, with the electricity it generates adding an economic incentive. \"There is a constraint in just how much [carbon capture and storage] we can have and how many trees we can grow, but we need all the help we can get,\" says Ralph Sims. For context, it's estimated forests  up to three times  the size of India would need to be grown, burnt and the carbon stored underground to halt global warming. \"We know that it works, can we rely on it? That's really a case of having to trust that we can,\" says Sims. Shaw says the Government's already trying to ramp up tree planting. \"We've planted over 60 million trees under the billion trees programme and the work that Shane Jones and I are doing on  changes  to the Emissions Trading Scheme will lead to significantly greater rates of planting than we've had in the past,\" he says. Shaw adds that it's important New Zealanders don't get bogged down in the negatives when it comes to the climate change transition. \"Climate change represents the greatest economic opportunity in at least a generation because the transition that we're talking about represents huge amounts of investment, huge amounts of innovation and new technology and that's great for the economy,\" he says.

{"id": null, "body": "A new report has issued a stark warning for the impact climate change could have on the country's primary industries. The Hawke's Bay Region Water Security Economic Impact Assessment states if nothing is done in the face of climate change there will be a considerable drop to the region's GDP and community wellbeing in the future. By the middle of the century, the region's income could drop by up to $120 million a year, according to some modelled scenarios. \"We often talk about growth opportunities but we hardly ever consider the cost and implications of inaction,\" says Rex Graham, chair of Hawke's Bay Regional Council.\u00a0 Anita Wreford, an associate professor of agribusiness and economics at Lincoln University, says the report highlights the vulnerability of the primaries industries. \"The primary sector is very dependent on the climate and has developed around a historically stable climate,\" Dr Wreford told Newshub.\u00a0 \"The changes projected (and already beginning to be experienced) will have important consequences for the sector in all parts of the country (although some may be more affected than others).\" Graham said water security and its effective management was one of the most significant challenges facing Hawke's Bay's economy, community and natural environment.\u00a0 In recent months a  crippling drought  has forced many farmers in the region to the point of desperation. Although the dry spell was  finally broken  after considerable rainfall last week and over the weekend, the drought's effect will continue to be felt into the winter. Dr Wreford says changes in rainfall frequency and intensity are likely to be \"significant\" in coming years. \"[There will be] longer periods without rain followed by potentially intense rainfall, leading to flooding and crop damage,\" she said. \"The effect on water availability will be important as well, particularly as we have developed systems that rely on a regular supply of water. Other risks include an increase in pests and diseases, and higher temperatures leading to heat stress for both livestock and some crops. A reduction in frosts and cold temperatures will have implications for certain crops that require periods of cold.\" Graham said the report was \"sobering\" news for the council. \"We need to focus on developing a range of interventions, not just one or two solutions, to be resilient in our future supplies of water that match our future demand, particularly relating to climate change.\" The report recommended the council consider the value of \"possible resilience-building initiatives\". \"The regional council has already directed staff to accelerate our water security programme to urgently investigate storage options to increase the supply of water in Central Hawke's Bay and Heretaunga,\" Graham said. He said storage and augmentation were just some of the solutions available. \"We will need to use other levers as well, like the allocation policy through proposed freshwater plan changes, water conservation initiatives and efficient use. This sits alongside the huge amount of work the council already does in relation to water quality, which cannot be compromised.\" Dr Wreford said it was possible to adapt to many of the challenges posed by climate change \"if we begin planning now\". It was necessary to not only identify the options we have in the short term, she said, but also to plan long-term \"ensuring we are not locking ourselves into types of production in locations that are likely to be adversely affected in the future\". \"Flexibility is key. Diversifying our systems more can make them more resilient to climate changes as well as potentially reducing emissions, improving water quality and biodiversity, depending on the production mix.\" Failure to act could lead to social disruption and economic disruption and hardship, Dr Wreford said. \"Responsibility really lies at all scales, from national, to regional, local, and individual producers as well.\"", "headline": "Primary industries under threat thanks to 'inaction' against climate change - report", "article_name": "primary-industries-under-threat-thanks-to-inaction-against-climate-change-report", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/rural/2020/06/primary-industries-under-threat-thanks-to-inaction-against-climate-change-report.html", "date_published": "2020-06-25 12:51:10", "article_length": 3951, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:12.920113"}
{"id": null, "body": "This article was originally published on  Excursionset. \n Leading physicist Richard Easther explains what's been going on with the smoky orange skies above New Zealand.\u00a0 On New Year's Day, social media in New Zealand was flooded with images of eerie orange skies above the South Island as the smoke from a continent-scale fire disaster crossed the Tasman Sea. The smoke shows equally well in the view from space. To set the scale, it is 2000km or three hours' flying from New Zealand to the Australian coast; the plume would stretch from London to Moscow, or from Denver to Washington DC. \n The above stunning image (and you'll be seeing more of them as the fires burn) was taken by the Japanese  Himawari  satellite. The spacecraft is in a geostationary orbit above the Pacific, keeping track with the rotating Earth and high enough to take images of the whole hemisphere beneath it. There is no sensible doubt that the magnitude of this crisis is driven by climate change. Australia has always had fires, but climate change makes the continent hotter and drier, nudging more places above the tipping point on which fire will take hold, on more days of the year. \n Climate change is, ultimately, an unintended consequence of human ingenuity. We can summon light at the flick of a switch, cross continents in a day, and the world's knowledge is at our fingertips. Billions of humans have access to miracles that emperors could never command. In fairy tales and fables, wishes granted by genies always come with an unanticipated price. These real-life wonders are no exception: carbon dioxide is poured into the atmosphere as we forge steel, burn fossil fuels to power cars and planes and generate electricity. When Pandora's Box was opened, while all manner of harm was unleashed into the world the last thing to be found in the box was hope. Climate change is not a myth or a fairy tale, but hope is still to be found in the satellite images of smoke spilling across the Tasman. Our capacity to snap pictures from space is just one of the tools we have to understand the climate and underscores our ability to develop technologies that let us walk more lightly on the earth. Ironically, our ability to significantly, albeit unintentionally, change the planet within a few generations reminds us that we have shaped the world that we live in, and can do so for both worse and for better. If you've been reassuring friends and family and yourself that climate change is probably nothing to worry about, look at the news from Australia. Take a moment. Take a deep breath. And think again. There are people who'll try to minimise and muddy the role of climate change, by telling you that this is all a mistake, or a con; that the fires were lit by arsonists; that forest floors should have been cleared of fuel. But none of this explains the ferocity of the scenes we are seeing on our screens and hearing from friends across the Tasman. There's no shame in having gotten it wrong when people have profited from telling you not to worry, glib climate sceptics get air time and media sites earn clicks from spreading ignorance as well as elucidation. In truth, the science is complex. Weather forecasts are in Celsius (or Fahrenheit, for Americans) but the universe thinks in Kelvins; degrees above absolute zero. Average temperatures have moved 1 degree Celsius, or 1 Kelvin. A 25 Celsius day is 298 Kelvins, so the global change in temperature we've seen so far is just over 1 part in 300. At the scale of the universe, our current planetary warming is small change. But ecosystems are finely balanced, and attuned to differences in temperatures, not its absolute value \u2013 like passengers in a small boat getting seasick from a gentle swell on top of a deep ocean. For Australia, an extra degree or two means hotter days, less rain, more heatwaves, more fires, which burn more fiercely once they get started. If our carbon emissions do not shift radically from \"business as usual\" that is only going to get worse. The real challenge is not scientific: it is social and political. We know what we need to do, and we can figure out how to do it. But we need to make it happen. If you are looking for New Year's resolutions, try some of these. Drive petrol-powered cars less. Ride a bike more (you'll get fitter). Get solar panels (which will likely save you money). Think carefully about the food you eat and how it's grown. Purchase thoughtfully. Fly less. And this is the big one: insist that our leaders are serious about climate, and expect them to follow through on their promises. You should worry. You should not despair. I'll close on this.

{"id": null, "body": "By Bruce Glavovic, Iain White and Tim Smith for The Conversation Decades of scientific evidence demonstrate unequivocally that human activities jeopardise life on Earth. Dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system compounds many other drivers of global change. Governments concur: the science is settled. But governments have failed to act at the scale and pace required. What should climate change scientists do? There is an unwritten social contract between science and society. Public investment in science is intended to improve understanding about our world and support beneficial societal outcomes. However, for climate change, the science-society contract is now broken. The failure to act decisively is an indictment on governments and political leaders across the board, but climate change scientists cannot be absolved of responsibility. As we write in an  article about this conundrum , the tragedy is the compulsion to provide ever more evidence when the phenomena are well understood and the science widely accepted. The tragedy is being gaslighted into thinking the impasse is somehow our fault, and we need to do science differently: crafting new scientific institutions, strategies, collaborations and methodologies. Yet, global carbon dioxide emissions are  60% higher today  than they were in 1990, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) published its first assessment. At some point we need to recognise the problem is political and that further climate change science may even divert attention away from where the problem truly lies. The outcome of COP26, summarised in the draft  Glasgow Climate Pact , includes some progress, including an agreement to begin reducing coal-fired power, removing subsidies on other fossil fuels, and a commitment to double adaptation finance to improve climate resilience for countries with the lowest incomes. But many of the world\u2019s leading scientists argue that this is  too little, too late . They note the failure of COP26 to translate the 2015  Paris Agreement  into practical reality to keep global warming below 1.5\u2103 above pre-industrial levels. Even if COP26 commitments are fulfilled, there is a strong likelihood that humanity and life on Earth face a precarious future. What are climate change scientists to do in the face of this evidence? We see three possible options \u2014 two that are untenable, one that is unpalatable. The first option is to collect more evidence and hope for action. Continue the IPCC process that stays politically neutral and abstains from policy prescriptions. A recent  editorial in Nature  called on scientists to do just that: stay engaged to support future climate COPs. However, this choice not only ignores the complex relationship between science and policy, it runs counter to the logic of our scientific training to reflect and act on the evidence. We know why global warming is happening and what to do. We have known for a long time. Governments just haven\u2019t taken the necessary action. In a recent Nature  survey , six in ten of the IPCC scientists who responded expect 3\u2103 warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Persisting with this first option is therefore untenable. The second option is more intensive social science research and climate change advocacy. As Harvard historian Naomi Oreskes recently  observed , the work of the IPCC\u2019s Working Group I ( WGI , on the physical science basis of climate change) is complete and should be closed down. Attention needs to focus on translating this understanding into action, which is the realm of WGII (on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability) and WGIII (on mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions). In parallel, growing numbers of scientists are getting involved in diverse forms of advocacy, including  non-violent civil disobedience . However, albeit more promising than option one, there is little evidence of impact thus far and it is doubtful this pathway will lead to the urgent transformative actions required. This option is also not tenable. The third option is much more radical, but unpalatable. We call for a moratorium on climate change research that does little more than document global warming and maladaptation. Attention needs to focus on exposing and re-negotiating the broken science-society contract. Given the rupture to the contract outlined here, we call for a halt on all further IPCC assessments until governments are willing to fulfil their responsibilities in good faith and mobilise action to secure a safe level of global warming. This option is the only way to overcome the tragedy of climate change science.

{"id": null, "body": "Related: What the latest IPCC climate report says is in store for New Zealand.  Credits: Video - The AM Show; Image - Reuters By Richard Hodgkins for The Conversation COP26, which is taking place in Glasgow, is the latest in a series of meetings through which the world's governments attempt to deal with climate change. COP stands for \"Conference of the Parties\": these 197 parties are the United Nations member countries, plus a few small non-UN member countries and the European Union, all of whom support the Framework Convention on Climate Change. This was set up in 1992 to organise a global response to what most people then called the \"greenhouse effect\". It's COP26 simply because this is the 26th meeting. The location of COP meetings changes each time. The last meeting was in Madrid in 2019. There was no COP in 2020 due to COVID-19. The most important COP so far was the 2015 meeting in Paris, which  agreed to  \"limit global warming to well below 2C, preferably to 1.5C, compared to pre-industrial levels\". It's possible to set a target like this because scientific research has recognised a  close relationship  between the amount of carbon dioxide in the global atmosphere and its average temperature. In order to achieve the target of \"well below 2C, preferably 1.5C\" the Paris Agreement  committed to  \"reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century\". The main task for COP26 is to follow through on this commitment and produce realistic plans to reduce global carbon emissions to levels that hold 21st-century global warming as close to 1.5C as possible. As you can imagine, getting 197 different countries, all with their own circumstances and interests, to agree to such plans isn't exactly straightforward: after all, it took 23 years to get to the Paris agreement. Most famously, Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement when president, although it returned after Joe Biden's election. So there is some uncertainty about how successful COP26 will be. The main method for reducing emissions is the Nationally-Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country: these are individual countries' climate action plans. For example, the UK's  most recent NDC  commits it to reducing emissions by at least 68 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The main problem facing COP26 is that the combined NDCs of all the parties aren't enough to meet the 1.5C target of the Paris agreement. If you combine all the current plans and promises contained in the NDCs, they would lead to a global temperature increase of 2.4C by the year 2100 and if you look at actual emissions now, they would lead to a global temperature increase  of 2.9C  by 2100. So there is a need for much-improved NDCs, plus effective ways to ensure that countries actually cut all the emissions they pledged to. One of the most important ways is for wealthy countries to provide  financial support  to enable less wealthy countries to cut emissions, which was an important part of the Paris Agreement but hasn't been fully acted on yet. COP26 matters because the window is quickly closing on the Paris Agreement's 1.5C target: if emissions don't fall very rapidly, very soon, too much carbon will have been added to the atmosphere to keep the temperature from rising higher. Current emissions need to be  halved by 2030  to have about a 50:50 chance of keeping to 1.5C. The longer the world delays before cutting emissions, either the harsher the cuts will need to be to meet the target, or the target will be missed altogether. The Paris Agreement matters because a  1.5C world  is safer than a 2C world. For example, the proportion of the global population exposed to severe heat at least once every five years is almost three times higher at 2C compared to 1.5C. The reduction in maize harvests in the tropical regions is over twice as great at 2C and  coral reefs would be largely eliminated . If COP26 isn't successful, it doesn't mean that we're doomed. But it would make it harder to avoid the worst effects of climate change, such as droughts, heatwaves, floods and rising seas. It's perhaps best to see COP26 as part of the long-term project to keep Earth as safe and habitable as possible for all its people, and the more successful it is, the easier that will be.

{"id": null, "body": "By Matt McDonald for The Conversation The climate talks in Glasgow are just days away, and may be the last chance to coordinate global efforts to stop the planet warming beyond 1.5C this century. More than 100 world leaders will  attend  the summit to try to agree on the details of crucial issues, such as timetables to deliver on emissions reduction commitments. So which countries hold the cards? Well, the nature of these particular climate talks make it less likely one or more states - regardless of their power or contribution to climate change - will determine the summit's success. But this wasn't always the case. In 1997 Kyoto Protocol talks, all developed states needed to agree on targets, timeframes and what could be included or excluded from calculations.  This meant  Australia was able to hold the agreement to ransom by threatening to withhold support, unless demands were met. In 2009 talks in Copenhagen, the plan was to develop a new post-Kyoto Protocol agreement, based on new binding emissions targets.  The reluctance of  China, and even the United States, ultimately prevented a new agreement being reached. Organisers of the Paris talks of 2015 learnt their lesson. Rather than aim to agree on a fair allocation of responsibility across almost 200 countries, organisers allowed states to develop their own nationally determined contributions - targets for reducing emissions. While the success of the Glasgow summit doesn't depend on a consensus across all participating nations, there are three big reasons international cooperation is still crucial. First, the summit serves as the default target date for nations to articulate new emissions reduction commitments since the Paris Agreement. States will also need to agree on the next deadline for updated national climate targets. Second, it will determine commitments from wealthy countries to finance developing states' transition away from greenhouse-intensive development like building new coal stations, and manage unavoidable effects of climate change, such as more severe and frequent disasters. Perhaps most fundamentally, the clock is ticking on an effective response to climate change, with  serious doubts  already over the feasibility of limiting climate change to 1.5 or even 2C: the goals of the Paris Agreement. So, who are the key players this time around? The US is the  second largest contributor  to global greenhouse gas emissions. As the world's largest economy, it plays a crucial role in influencing pricing signals relevant to greenhouse emissions, such as energy markets, and facilitating agreement on transferring resources from developed to developing countries. Since stepping into office, the Joe Biden Administration has demonstrated a significant commitment to international climate action, promising to cut emissions  50-52 percent  from 2005 levels by 2030 and announcing a plan to double funds for developing countries - up to  US$11 billion by 2024 . The big question is less about its ambitions, which are on the table, and more about whether the US can convince others  to do more . This clearly applies to countries reluctant to take stronger action like Australia, but also to countries where bilateral relations have been less friendly: principally China. China looms as possibly the most important state for the Glasgow talks: it's the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, the world's  largest producer of coal  and the second largest economy in the world. While we've seen promising signs with a commitment to  net-zero emissions  and to no  new coal-fired power stations abroad , we've also seen no new emissions reduction target since Paris and no confirmation President Xi Jinping will attend the summit. Official sources suggest  cooperation on climate action can't be wholly separated from broader relations between states. This raises the prospect that China's deteriorating relations with the US - over human rights, the South China Sea and Taiwan, for example - pose a key impediment to Chinese ambitions and, therefore, to global climate action. For China, it's arguably important not to be seen bowing to international pressure, which seriously complicates effective diplomacy from states eager to see strong action. The UK is the host of the Glasgow talks, and host states always feel some sense of ownership over these summits. They  also develop  formal conference \"priorities\" that influence the focus of negotiations and criteria for their success. We've seen the UK's diplomatic efforts through its role hosting recent international summits and consistently raising the issue in bilateral talks. It has also announced one of the world's  most ambitious climate targets : a 78 percent reduction of emissions from 1990 levels by 2035. Given the recent mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis and Brexit, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be under  serious pressure  at home to ensure the talks are a success. Russia has been a belated and apparently grudging participant in the last two major international climate agreements. The Kyoto Protocol only entered into force when Russia eventually  ratified the agreement in 2004  - some seven years after signing. Its ratification of the Paris Agreement  was similarly belated . Russia is one of the  top five greenhouse gas emitters  and the world's largest oil producer. Russian President Vladimir Putin has consistently downplayed the risks of climate change, with Russia emerging as  the most vocal opponent  to discussing the security implications of climate change within the UN Security Council. But there are some positives in the lead up to Glasgow. Putin announced a new\u00a0 climate strategy in June , and enacted new climate laws in July. Meanwhile,\u00a0 reports suggest \u00a0Moscow is considering both a net-zero goal and a new emissions reduction target. Arguably, Russia's position will tell us much about the momentum behind international climate action. As the world's  third largest greenhouse emitter , India is a de facto leader of developing countries concerned about sustainable development and the costs of climate action. We've seen no new targets from India since Paris in 2015, even given its commitment to invest in renewable energy since. Most recently, we've seen Indian leaders  focus on  the importance of wealthy states funding any transition away from fossil fuels in the developing world. Ultimately, the capacity to secure Indian support for key Glasgow initiatives will depend on whether developed states are willing to reach into their pockets to finance an energy transition.

Credits: Image - Getty, video - The AM Show A new report says New Zealand needs to act now to reduce emissions and avoid climate catastrophe. The Productivity Commission has released its findings into how the country can become a low-emissions economy, with transport and agriculture the two biggest obstacles to that goal. Finance Minister Grant Robertson says things will have to be done differently in order to meet lofty emissions targets. \"This report is a timely reminder to New Zealanders that the change we're looking at will mean that we have to be innovative and look to different sources of energy.\" He told The AM Show the Government is committed to reducing transport emissions, but that changes need to work for Kiwis used to a car-driven lifestyle. \"While I agree that big change is required, we have to bring people with us. It's got to be a just transition.\" He denied that those changes would disproportionately target farmers, but said methane production is one of the country's major sources of climate emissions and must be lowered. \"[Farmers] don't have anything to fear whatsoever, but we've been absolutely clear that they will enter into the Emissions Trading Scheme and that is one of the examples of things that haven't happened in the past.\" Climate Change Minister James Shaw said in a statement that farmers around the country are actually benefiting financially from \"lower emissions practices\", but Federated Farmers Vice-President Andrew Hoggard says farmers need to accept that reducing emissions may come at a cost. \"Our long lived gas, nitrous dioxide, is in the same boat as carbon dioxide, so if I'm being honest I've got to say yeah, we've got to do something about that and it may be there is a cost attached to that.\" He told The AM Show that New Zealand should strive to lower emissions slowly and consistently, rather than risk harming the economy through drastic changes. \"Every year we reduce our intensity by 1.3 percent of emissions per kg of milk solids. I think we just keep that constant improvement going on, what we don't do is a slash and burn and destroy our agricultural economy to meet some goals. \"I think we've got to be careful about how we go about this and not, for want of a better word, 'virtue signal' and stuff our economy up.\" Mr Hoggard pointed out that the country's methane production has increased by just 4 percent since 1990, while transport emissions are up 82 percent - but denied trying to shift the blame to another sector. \"I'm not pointing the finger at anyone\u2026it's not one sector against another, it's all sectors coming up with solutions to go forward.\" Victoria University climate change research professor Adrian Macey agreed that New Zealand needs to make urgent changes in regards to transport. \"What the commission is saying is we need to shift to electric cars much more quickly,\" he told The AM Show. \"The other point is that New Zealanders hold onto their cars way longer than most countries, so you've got emission locked in if you're buying a car now and hold onto it for 15, 20 years. That's not going to help.\" He says the Government needs to \"get stuck in\" to incentivising Kiwis to drive less or to switch to electric cars. \"What you've got in that report is the most comprehensive look we've ever had at the whole of the New Zealand economy and how this transition might take place, and I think the Government will take notice of that.\" The report's emissions targets for 2030 and 2050 will be difficult to reach, but Professor Macey says he's confident New Zealand can meet them.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty When the results of his latest research into carbon emissions came in, Louis Schipper sat back in his chair and just stared.\u00a0 \"Oh,\" the professor of biogeochemistry at the University of Waikato said to himself, expletives running through his head. \"We have a problem.'\"\u00a0 While that might not be news to anyone who's been keeping an eye on climate change the past couple of decades, Dr Schipper fears we have far less time to find a fix than anyone realises.\u00a0 \"What we found is that the ecosystems of the world look like they're going to stop absorbing as much carbon dioxide as they have in the past,\" he told Newshub. \"In the past, all of our forests and grass have taken up carbon dioxide, offsetting some of the emissions that we have made into the atmosphere. That's been of great benefit for us - it's bought us some time.\u00a0 \"But what we have observed from this data is that the amount of carbon dioxide that's going to be taken up by these ecosystems is going to decline. We're going to have less time than perhaps we thought to reduce emissions into the atmosphere.\"\u00a0 His study , published in journal  Science Advances  on Thursd ay, says sometime in the next 20 to 30 years the world's plants will likely start releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than they can absorb.\u00a0 Dr Schipper, with colleagues at the University of Waikato and Northern Arizona University, analysed 20 years of data taken from 100 sites around the world in different environments, including Paeroa, to see \"how sensitive the major processes involved in carbon exchange are to changing temperature\". \"The key finding that all of this work has led to is that photosynthesis seems to maximise at about 18C for most plants, whereas respiration carries on upwards as temperature increases,\" said Dr Schipper. \"What that means is anytime you're above 18C you're getting less photosynthesis than before and more respiration - that means you're spending more than you're earning and your savings are going to go down.\"\u00a0 The world has been warming like never before since the 1800s, thanks to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The rate of temperature increase has sped up in the past couple of decades, with many scientists fearing feedback loops are starting to kick in - for example, warming has left less of the Earth's surface covered in ice, meaning less of the sun's energy is reflected back into space,  resulting in even more warming .\u00a0 A separate study published in December  suggested it's almost certain we'll cross the threshold for a \"dangerous\" level of global warming as soon as 2038. Last year was the equal-hottest on record, tied with 2016 - more than 1C warmer than the long-term average. A higher average means more volatility in day-to-day temperatures, with more time spent above that 18C mark. The world's plants currently absorb about a third of the carbon we humans put into the atmosphere. \"We think - or the data suggests - that we're going to see a 50 percent decline in the amount of carbon dioxide that is being taken out of the atmosphere by plant systems, mid-century,\" said Dr Schipper. \"That is a rather shocking result... These are not the sort of results that you hope for.\" Others on Dr Schipper's team felt the same. \"When we saw this, I thought, 'I can't drive a car anymore,'\" said University of Waikato biochemist Vic Arcus. \" I sold my car and bought an electric bike. That was my response to these data.\" It's not clear why plants' photosynthesis winds down as temperatures surpass 18C, the scientists say, and they're continuing to refine their theory to make it more robust.\u00a0 \"We should be looking at growing more plants that will capture carbon dioxide, we should be looking at renewable energy and decreasing emissions from fossil fuels, and we should be looking at the way we are producing food so that we can do that in ways that reduce total greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Dr Schipper.", "headline": "Climate change: Kiwi-led study finds terrifying tipping point possibly only 20 years away", "article_name": "climate-change-kiwi-led-study-finds-terrifying-tipping-point-possibly-only-20-years-away", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/01/climate-change-kiwi-led-study-finds-terrifying-tipping-point-possibly-only-20-years-away.html", "date_published": "2021-01-14 08:44:15", "article_length": 4007, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:14.947347"}

Federated Farmers said  the Government's discussion paper  was a positive first step on a practical path to reduce livestock greenhouse gas emissions. \"We are agreed that a priority is to find a workable and affordable way that farmers can measure emissions and sinks at the farm level, and to adopt practices and any new technologies that will help drive down methane and nitrous oxide emissions,\" said climate change spokesman Andrew Hoggard\u00a0 However he said the group was opposed to using the ETS. \"The ETS has failed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from transport - in fact, transport emissions have near doubled since 1990. Universal pricing of methane will be similarly unsuccessful.\" He said Federated Farmers had committed to is working with the government to design a pricing mechanism where any price is part of a broader framework to support on-farm practice change.\u00a0 \"Such pricing would be set at the margin - that is, only applying to methane emissions over the 0.3 percent per annum reductions that science tells us is enough to ensure methane no longer adds to global warming.\" The ICCC estimated that the price incurred by farmers bringing agriculture into the ETS at 5 percent would be $0.01 per kilogram of milk solids.\u00a0 Public consultation on the  discussion document  is open until 13 August.

By James Renwick I receive a lot of emails from people concerned about climate change, and some that challenge the science. I hear many of the same arguments over and over, arguments that are well known to be mistaken or misguided.\u00a0 For the record, here are the claims followed by the real story: Global warming is not significantly affected by man's activities and just part of the Earth's natural cycle The Earth's climate has gone through several ice ages and hot periods over millions of years. That variability is no comfort; it tells us that the climate is sensitive and able to change radically.\u00a0 The only two things that change surface temperatures are the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, and the amount of greenhouse gas in the air.\u00a0 A brighter sun, or more greenhouse gas, gives you a warmer climate. A dimmer sun or less greenhouse gas gives you a colder climate.\u00a0 Today, the sun is not changing much but the amount of greenhouse gas in the air is increasing rapidly.\u00a0 By measuring the chemical signature of the carbon in the air, we know the increase is coming from the burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal. So we know it's us changing the climate today. Carbon dioxide isn't the problem as it only makes up a small amount of the atmosphere. Why not focus on water vapour? Carbon dioxide makes up 0.04 percent of the atmosphere, but it is great at absorbing heat radiated up by the Earth, so even though it's a small fraction it has a powerful effect. It's a bit like spices in cooking. If a pot of food was 0.04 percent chilli powder, you would be able to taste the hotness of that food.\u00a0 A small ingredient can be very important if it's potent enough, and that's definitely the case for carbon dioxide in the air.\u00a0 Water vapour is also important because it is a strong greenhouse gas, like carbon dioxide. But water vapour can never cause changes in climate by itself because it stays in the air only a few days before it falls out as rain. Carbon dioxide stays in the air for centuries, warming the atmosphere.\u00a0 The amount of water vapour in the air is controlled only by temperature. Warm the air by adding carbon dioxide, and the increased water vapour content of the air will warm things further, amplifying the carbon dioxide effect. Records and models pre-1980 are unreliable and cannot be trusted for comparison Since about 1880, there have been enough thermometers spread around the world, on land and on ships at sea, to give us a reliable record of global temperatures.\u00a0 Things like rain and winds are not so well measured back in time, but that\u2019s changing as we recover and digitise old paper records.\u00a0 Climate models are as reliable for today's climate as they are for the climate hundreds or thousands of years ago, provided we can tell them how bright the sun was and how much greenhouse gas there was in the air.\u00a0 The models capture the day-to-day weather, the changing of the seasons, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events, and do a great job of tracking global temperatures since the 1880s. Kiwi farmers reducing methane levels won't impact the climate Methane is a very important greenhouse gas, much better than carbon dioxide at absorbing heat, but it stays in the air for much less time, only a decade or so.\u00a0 Still, reducing methane reduces the warming effect. Agriculture in New Zealand makes up around half of our total greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from methane and nitrous oxide, so changes to agriculture have to be a part of New Zealand\u2019s response to climate change.\u00a0 Our country contributes less than 1 percent of total global emissions, but that's only because there are not many people living here. Per head of population, we are in the top 10 of global emitters, so we have as much responsibility as any other group of 5 million people around the world. Only China can stop global warming, so New Zealand acting is pointless To really stop global warming, every country must get to zero emissions of greenhouse gases.\u00a0 China is the largest emitter, but if you add up all the small players like New Zealand, they account for more emissions than China, so every country can play a role.\u00a0 If New Zealand can become zero-carbon, we can be an example and an inspiration to other countries and we can show the others, whether it's China or Chile, how to become fossil-free. The science is not settled on climate change The basics of the science, that increased greenhouse gas levels lead to a warmer climate, have been well known for 100 years or more. There is no argument about this at all in the scientific community.\u00a0 That doesn't mean we know everything though - there are plenty of details still to work out, like how cloudiness will change over the Southern Oceans, and how much the big ice sheets will melt this century.\u00a0 Some things are always up for discussion, but the way that greenhouse gases warm the Earth is as well understood as the force of gravity or how microwave ovens work. Global warming isn't leading to more extreme weather events We see very clear increases in high temperature extremes and heat waves around the world, and decreases in cold extremes.\u00a0 Even in the oceans, we are seeing big increases in marine heatwaves such as the one that affected New Zealand in the summer of 2017/18.\u00a0 The occurrence of marine heatwaves has doubled worldwide since the 1980s. Looking at floods and heavy rain, we can see a climate change signal, since a warmer atmosphere has more moisture in it.\u00a0 That effect contributes to heavy rainfalls all over the world.\u00a0 At the same time, droughts are getting more intense, as a warmer climate means evaporation works faster so soils dry out more quickly. How can the world be warming when there are still cold days? The weather will always change from day to day, the seasons will always change, even though everything is warming up.\u00a0 What people call a cold day in 50 years would be a mild day today, just like the cold days we have now are warmer than they used to be 50 years ago.\u00a0 We see all around New Zealand that the number of frosts is on the way down, fast. Most places in New Zealand can still experience frosts, but the chances are decreasing all the time.\u00a0 The 500 so-called climate scientists who wrote to the UN saying there was no climate emergency have credibility They don\u2019t. There are one or two who have training and a track record in climate science, but most have no climate science background and are the same individuals who keep cropping up in climate denial groups.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Past predictions of sea level rises have turned out to be \"on the money\", with  scientists now warning  we're on track for \"metres of sea level rise\" close to the worst-case scenarios they can think of. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has outlined three different potential outcomes this century - one of emissions resulting in 2C of warming (called RCP2.6), one in which the world fails to take any meaningful action whatsoever (RCP8.5) and something in-between these two (RCP4.5).\u00a0 \"The analysis of the recent sea level data indicate the world is tracking between RCP4.5 and the worst-case scenario of RCP8.5,\" said John Church, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales. Australian and Chinese researchers looked at predictions made by the IPCC using computer modelling, and found they were \"closely consistent with observations on both global and regional scales\" made between 2007 and 2018. \"Our analysis implies that the models are close to observations and builds confidence in the current projections for the next several decades,\"\u00a0 said Prof Church. \"If we continue with large ongoing emissions as we are at present, we will commit the world to metres of sea level rise over coming centuries.\" Just how much of that rise will happen in our lifetimes remains to be seen. While the observations place us on a trajectory between the middle- and worst-case scenarios, that could quickly change as unexpected feedback loops come into play. \"While the confirmation of the projection trends gives us confidence in current understanding of near future sea-level change, it leaves open questions concerning late 21st century non-linear accelerations from ice-sheet contributions,\" the study,  published in journal  Nature Communications , reads. In other words, it's possible climate change could speed up - less ice means more trapped methane being released, as well less of the sun's energy being reflected into space, both heating up the planet. \"A cycle of self-reinforcing processes is established,\"  one study concluded last year . \"The process is self-sustaining, at least until all carbon is released from permafrost and all ice is melted.\" Another non-linear acceleration is  water vapour  - as the atmosphere heats, more water evaporates into vapour, which itself is a strong greenhouse gas - leading to more warming. \"There remains a potential for larger sea level rises, particularly beyond 2100 for high  emission  scenarios,\" said Prof Church. \"Therefore, it is urgent that we still try to meet the commitments of the Paris Agreement by significantly reducing emissions.\" \u00a0", "headline": "Climate change: World on course for 'metres of sea level rise', scientists warn", "article_name": "climate-change-world-on-course-for-metres-of-sea-level-rise-scientists-warn", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2021/02/climate-change-world-on-course-for-metres-of-sea-level-rise-scientists-warn.html", "date_published": "2021-02-16 13:06:55", "article_length": 2749, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:15.947670"}

Credits: Image - Getty Images; Video - The AM Show  By Doug Specht and Silvia Angeli for The Conversation.\u00a0 OPINION: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s sobering \" code red for humanity \" report comes on the heels of months of devastating weather events around the world. Our front pages have been dominated by photos that look as if they've come from a film - images of  heroic teams tackling forest fires  against a bright orange sky, of planes dropping water and fire retardant,  cars sinking into flooded streets  and destroyed buildings. One image - that of a ferry, carrying evacuees from the Greek Island of Evia, surrounded by fire, helpless and in the middle of crisis - drew comparisons to the ferry scenes in the 2005 remake of  War of the Worlds . In the film, people poured onto a vehicle ferry in a desperate attempt to escape the extraterrestrial invasion. In Greece, the ferry made safe landing, and  all passengers were accounted for . But in the film, few, bar the protagonists, survived that moment. While War of the Worlds ends happily - with the alien lifeforms that had ravaged the world succumbing to their vulnerability to microbes on Earth - the footage from Greece is just one scene in a story for which the ending is not yet fully written. It might seem frivolous to compare such moments to films, but these comparisons play an important role in helping us to comprehend and make sense of particular moments in history. Like all works of art, films reveal much about the social and political zeitgeist in which they are conceived and produced, often acting as magnifying lenses for humankind's hopes and anxieties. Psychoanalysis researcher Vicky Lebeau  has note d that films can reveal the desires and fears of the societies that watch them. We have seen this in science fiction films, such as  Invasion of the Body Snatchers  and  The Day the Earth Stood Still , which flourished during the  cold war , inspired by the space race and the arms race. The proliferation of blockbuster disaster films just before the turn of the millennium ( Twister ,  Dante's Peak ,  Armageddon ,  Deep Impact , to name a few), fed off theories that  the world would end  as we entered the year 2000. And it is also no accident that during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic the  most watched films  online were  Contagion ,  Outbreak  and  28 Days Later  - all of which depict degrees of pandemic apocalypse. Through these stories, directors have offered us an enthralling yet terrifying glimpse of what the end of the world might look like. It could be caused by zombies ( Walking Dead ,  I Am Legend ,  Shaun of the Dead ), biological demise ( Children of Men ,  Logan's Run ), climate change ( The Day After Tomorrow ,  Snowpiercer ,  Flood ), nuclear accident or war ( Dr Strangelove ), or ancient prophecy ( 2012 ). However, none of these are truly end-of-world narratives. Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic films start with the risk of total destruction, but more often than not, after the cataclysmic event of the story, a form of normality returns - balance is restored to the world and life can once again move forward. This way of storytelling brings these films closer to the true meaning of apocalypse. The root of the word \"apocalypse\" comes from the ancient Greek term \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (apokaly\u0301ptein), which  translates roughly  as \"unveiling\" or \"revealing\". The implication being that the near destruction of the city or planet allows for a new understanding, a shift in priorities and a new way of seeing the world - or a renewed and better existence. The scenes of flooding and fires that fill our news programmes echo those we see in movies. But for them to be truly apocalyptic, rather than merely world ending, they must reveal something to us. As we watch the real-world events unfold, the IPCC report makes clear what they reveal - that humans have changed the climate and we are on a trajectory to make much of our environment unlivable. But unlike the films, not everyone is going to be saved in 90 thrilling minutes. By comparing reality to films, we are seeking the hope for renewal that these apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic narratives give us. Nevertheless, they are ultimately fiction. While rehearsing the end of the world through film can exorcise fears, at the same time they may have desensitised us, lulling us into a false sense of security that all will be well in the end - and  that we are immortal . If our own apocalypse is a three-act film, then the last 200 years of environmental harms have been the setup, the exposition. We are now at the moment of confrontation. We all, as the lead characters, must confront the reality of what is around us. If not, the third act, the resolution, may not be the ending we hope for. As French philosopher Jacques Derrida warned: \"the end approaches, but the apocalypse is long lived\". Doug Specht is a senior Lecturer in Media and Communications at the University of Westminster.

He confirmed that we want to leave the EU with a deal but we are committed to leaving on October 31 whatever the circumstances.\" Those comments were echoed by Ardern who called the phone call \"very productive\". \"Our discussion focused on securing a free trade deal between our countries and Prime Minister Johnson said New Zealand was a high priority for negotiations following Brexit, which is very good for our exporters and economy.\" Establishing a free trade agreement is extremely important to New Zealand's relationship with the United Kingdom.\u00a0 The UK is New Zealand's fifth-largest food and beverage export market , worth $1.6b in 2017. However, that relationship is threatened by the UK's exit from the European Union.\u00a0 If Johnson manages to pass a Brexit Withdrawl Agreement through the British Parliament,  a transition period will be implemented , allowing time for the UK and New Zealand to form a new trade agreement.\u00a0 However, that may not happen, with the European Union not budging from its position that it won't renegotiate the deal that former UK Prime Minister Theresa May failed to get through the Parliament on multiple occasions.\u00a0 If a deal isn't passed, it's likely a no-deal Brexit will occur, meaning Britain will leave the European Union with no period of transition. \"A no-deal Brexit would likely increase the costs and procurement times of New Zealand exports, reducing demand for these products,\" said  IBISWorld senior industry analyst Liam Harrison  in April. \"In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK reverts to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules regarding trade, which would force the UK to place tariffs and quotas on certain products.\" According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade,  New Zealand does have several agreements and continuity arrangements  in place to ensure continuity in some trading conditions between New Zealand and the UK, especially in the case of a no-deal exit. But New Zealand Trade Enterprise has also  released information on how businesses can prepare themselves  for when Brexit arrives. On the issue of terrorists using the internet to spread their messages, New Zealand and the UK share a commitment to eliminating extremist content online with the Christchurch call. Ardern said in a statement that that pledge was brought up on the call. \"We also discussed next steps in the Christchurch Call and ending terrorist content online, climate change and other issues of shared interest, as well as getting an update on UK's progress on Brexit.\u00a0 A follow-up conversation on the pledge will likely occur in September alongside the UN General Assembly. Following Johnson's election in July, Ardern  had a \"positive text exchange\"  with him. \"Mr Johnson is familiar with New Zealand in his former role as Foreign Secretary and has an excellent relationship with our Foreign Minister that I am sure will be mutually beneficial for our countries.\" Newshub.", "headline": "Jacinda Ardern, Boris Johnson chat trade agreements, climate change, online extremism", "article_name": "jacinda-ardern-boris-johnson-chat-trade-agreements-climate-change-online-extremism", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/08/jacinda-ardern-boris-johnson-chat-trade-agreements-climate-change-online-extremism.html", "date_published": "2019-08-13 10:37:30", "article_length": 3876, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:17.177478"}

In its ruling, the Administrative Tribunal of Paris said there were \u201cwrongful deficiencies on the part of the state in implementing public policies to allow it to achieve objectives it had set on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions\u201d. Reacting to the ruling, government spokesman Gabriel Attal said that although the government was making huge efforts to catch up, it was fair to say France had been late in addressing global warming. \u201cI share in that observation, and we are responding, and those who urge the state to go further should make proposals so we can reach these objectives and go even further,\u201d he told a regular briefing for reporters.

Credits: Video: Newshub  Image:Getty The Government and farming sector leaders have reached an agreement over climate change, which would see on-farm emissions accounted for by 2025. In an announcement on Tuesday, farming groups are to work with the Government to implement farm-level pricing of climate change emissions from the sector. \n It comes with the Government's release of a consultation document, informed by the work of the Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC). \n It looks at how to bring agriculture into the emissions trading scheme, a key part of the Government's plan to tackle climate change and reduce New Zealand's emissions.\u00a0 Agricultural emissions make up nearly half of New Zealand's total emissions profile and are the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand.\u00a0 Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said the cooperation and consensus between the farming sector and the Government was an incredibly important shift from farmers and growers on the need to tackle climate change. \"We are now agreed on the outcome; Government and farmers want emissions to be calculated at the farm level where farmers have the most control over how they can manage their own emissions on their property,\" he said.\u00a0 \"We are now consulting on the options for what we do in the meantime while we build a fair system to price emissions from 2025,\" said O'Connor. Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw said it was a significant change. \"The big breakthrough is that, for the first time, the leadership of the main farmers' organisations and farming businesses have reached a level of consensus amongst themselves that emissions pricing is part of the solution for reducing agricultural emissions, as it is for the rest of the economy,\" he said. \"Of course, there is a significant amount of infrastructure that needs to get laid down across tens of thousands of farms to make that work. Some of that infrastructure still needs to be developed. That's why we need to work closely together over the next few years to make this work,\" said Shaw.\u00a0 He said the ICCC had provided its recommendations on how to make the transition work while farming leaders had provided a counter-proposal.\u00a0 \"We're now putting those options before the wider public for consultation so they can both be tested.\"\u00a0 Both options aim to see on-farm emissions accounted for and priced by 2025. The ICCC recommends developing a fund, led by farming leaders, to build the skills and technologies farmers will need to measure and manage their on-farm emissions. It's estimated that could provide a fund of $47 million a year which would be 100 percent recycled back into fitting out farmers and growers with the measurement tools and know-how to control farm emissions through a processor levy over the next five years, which would eventually lead to farmers handling emissions at the farm-gate by 2025. Farmers would receive a 95 per cent discount on emissions in line with similar discounts for other industries. Farming leaders are offering an alternative sector-led proposal, which it would manage, to get the agricultural sector into an emissions pricing system by 2025, funded through the sector's levy organisations, like Federated Farmers, Dairy NZ, and NZ Beef and Lamb. Shaw said New Zealanders were committed to seeing greenhouse gas emissions reduced to levels that limit the impacts of climate change. \"What we're working through, with proposals like these affecting agricultural emissions, is a range of options, initiatives and supports that can turn that commitment into meaningful action. \"We acknowledge and welcome the farming sector's commitment to engage with the Government to be part of the climate change solution.\" It's estimated the average dairy farm, with a 95 per cent discount on emissions, at the current NZ ETS price of $25/tonne would incur $0.01c per kg of milk solids. The average cost on beef production is estimated at $0.01c per kg of beef, $0.03c per kg of sheep meat, and $0.04c per kg of venison.

Genter, also Minister for Women, made the declaration on Twitter while defending the Government's  proposed fees  for cars being imported that don't meet a 'clean car' policy tipped for 2021. Vehicles that emit over 250 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre (CO2/km) would be considered heavy polluters so importing those vehicles would come with a financial penalty of up to $3000. On the flip side, new imported vehicles that produce zero emissions - like the Hyundai Ioniq - would be eligible for an $8000 discount, while used zero-emission cars would get $2600 off. \"The climate crisis is the biggest challenge of our time. It's our generation's WWII. We are the first generation to feel its impacts,\" Genter said. \"New Zealand was too small to win WWII. But that didn't stop many of our forebears from putting their hand up. They put their lives on hold, and travelled far away, to be part of a larger effort, because it was the right thing to do.\" Some Twitter users agreed with Genter's comparison, with one user saying: \"Climate change and WW2 are very similar. Massive threats to our way of life that requires concerted and substantial action to overcome, including sacrificing lifestyle.\" But others weren't convinced. One person wrote: \"Not a very well thought out metaphor and bugger-all to do with this current situation and alarmism doesn't help with clarity of thought.\" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern made a similar  generational comparison  in 2017, when she declared climate change her \"generation's nuclear-free moment.\" Genter labelled climate change a \"wicked problem\" that individuals can't solve alone. She said the proposed standards for cars are a \"framework so more people can choose vehicles that use less petrol\". Her tweets followed backlash against the proposals over popular ute vehicles like the Ford Ranger and Toyota Hilux becoming more expensive to import to New Zealand. The Toyota LandCruiser would be $3000 more expensive, the Mitsubishi Triton would jump by $2500, the Ford Ranger would be $2750 more and the Toyota Hilux would increase by $2000. National's Associate Transport spokesperson Brett Hudson said hiking the cost of certain vehicles will impose more costs on some families who can't afford to switch to an electric vehicle.

Genter said she spoke with the imported vehicle industry on Wednesday night and \"heard their concerns\" and also shared her own views with them. \"I understand some people are fearful, or feel that they are being penalised for buying vehicles that would attract a fee,\" she said on Twitter. \"The fees are small as a percentage of the price of the vehicle.

{"id": null, "body": "Using water more efficiently in everything from daily life to agriculture and industry would help curb climate change - a potential benefit not widely recognised. In a report issued on World Water Day, UN agencies said global warming threatened the right to water and sanitation for \"potentially billions of people\". Policymakers and businesses should seek to manage water resources better, to economise on the electricity and fuel needed to pump, clean and deliver water, the report said. \"If you save water, you're saving energy and reducing the greenhouse gases to produce that energy to bring the water,\" said Richard Connor, the report's editor. Using less energy cuts down further on the water needed to produce electricity, creating a virtuous circle, he said. Even more water can be saved by switching to less-thirsty power sources like wind instead of fossil fuels, he added. Water use has increased six-fold over the past century and is rising by about 1 percent a year, said the United Nations World Water Development Report 2020. It outlined ways water could be used and recycled more effectively to limit emissions, alongside looking after nature. Restoring and protecting wetlands, for example, is of \"critical importance\" because they store twice as much carbon as forests, while also preventing floods, purifying water and providing a habitat for animals and birds, the report said. Conservation agriculture - a green farming approach that causes minimal disturbance to the soil - helps reduce carbon emissions and the huge amounts of water needed for crop irrigation in intensive farming systems. Treating more wastewater would also make a big difference, said the report, noting 80 to 90 pe cent of wastewater is discharged to the environment without any form of treatment. Untreated wastewater is a major source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. The best solution, the report said, is to invest in modern techniques that extract methane from organic matter in wastewater and use this biogas to generate the energy needed to treat the water - a method already used in some water-scarce countries like Jordan, Mexico, Peru and Thailand. One of the main barriers to these types of approaches is a lack of cooperation between government officials working on climate change and those tasked with managing water. \"When it comes time to move from talk to action - be it finance or otherwise - the talk falls on deaf ears and water gets put aside and ... left behind,\" said Connor. More concrete efforts to adapt to rising water stress and cut emissions from water use will require joint planning between climate change and water specialists, as well as greater investment to put them into practice, the report said.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty A new Kiwi study has found no matter how efficiently New Zealand produces meat, cutting back is still the best way to fight climate change.\u00a0 University of Otago researchers looked into the food industry's impact on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Senior author Alex MacMillan says they found no evidence that we are being much more sustainable than anyone else. \"That is a surprise, because we're told all the time by the industry that we're a low-emissions producer of meat and dairy.\" The study,  published in journal  Environmental Health Perspectives , ranked New Zealand's beef and lamb production as more efficient than the global average (emitting 21kg and 17kg of carbon dioxide per kilogram of meat, respectively, compared to a world average of\u00a0 27kg and 26kg.)\u00a0 But the average Kiwi adult's diet was overall no better for the climate, with the typical emissions \"broadly in line with estimates from around Europe\". \"Our analysis showed that the potential for achieving diet-related emissions reductions is primarily determined by the type and quantity of meat consumed,\" the study reads, backing up claims made in a controversial climate change teaching resource being rolled out to schools this year.\u00a0 The study also found that people think it's better to buy locally-grown food. But Dr Alex MacMillan says this is no longer necessarily the case, with transport costs only making up a small proportion of emissions. \"From a climate pollution perspective, it doesn't matter where you get your plant-based food from. It's always better to choose a plant-based food rather than meat, regardless of where it was grown.\" Their findings  back up a UK study from 2018 , which researchers said proved a \"vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth\". If every Kiwi adult switched to a plant-based diet, the researchers behind the latest study say it would be the equivalent of a 59 percent reduction in car emissions, as it takes a lot more resources to produce meat than plants. It could also save up to $20 billion in health costs over the lifetime of the current New Zealand population.\u00a0 \"Fortunately, foods that are health-promoting tend also to be those that are climate-friendly,\" said Dr MacMillan. \"Conversely, certain foods that carry known health risks are particularly climate-polluting. Red and processed meat intake, for instance, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes and certain cancers.\" And before you go claiming it's impossible to live on a vegan diet, Dr MacMillan says the adult diet they based the research on meets New Zealand guidelines. \"As our modelled dietary scenarios became increasingly plant-based and therefore more climate-friendly, we found that associated population-level health gains and healthcare cost savings tended also to increase.\u00a0 \"A scenario that replaced all meat, seafood, eggs, and dairy products with plant-based alternatives, and that also required people to cut out all unnecessary household food waste, was found to offer the greatest benefit.\" A spokesperson for Beef+Lamb NZ  told NZME  the study was \"unfair\" and \"overly simplistic\", saying most land used in New Zealand would be unsuitable for producing plant-based foods. Beef and lamb were singled out by the researchers as the most emissions-intensive foods, followed by processed meats, pork, shellfish, butter and cheese. Further back were fish, eggs, poultry and yoghurt, followed by processed foods (cookes, ice cream, pies, soft drinks), nuts and rice, then at the bottom, plant foods. A  new resource  being rolled out for teachers to help them teach climate change this year angered many with its advice to \"eat less meat and dairy\" to help reduce emissions.

The risk assessment is an overview of how New Zealand may be affected by climate change-related hazards, and will be used to develop a national adaptation plan over the next two years. The assessment has been done based on a \"high-emissions, business-as-usual future, resulting in a projected 67 centimetre sea level rise and three degrees Celsius temperature increase by 2090''. Extreme weather events such as storms, heatwaves and heavy rainfall are likely to be more frequent and intense. Large increases in extreme rainfall are expected everywhere in the country and the number of frost and snow days are projected to decrease, the report says. The National Climate Change Risk Assessment identified 43 risks that could have a major or extreme consequence to New Zealand. Of these, there are 10 risks the report says require urgent action in the next six years. There were some opportunities identified as a result of climate change, but the report noted research would need to be done to ensure responses to those opportunities didn't worsen climate change impacts unintentionally. The opportunities are higher productivity in some primary sectors due to warmer weather; businesses being able to provide adaptation-related goods and services; lower cold weather-related mortality, and lower winter heating demand. M\u0101ori will also be disproportionately impacted, including, risks to social, cultural, spiritual and economic wellbeing from loss and degradation of lands and waters, and from loss of species and biodiversity. Also, risks to social cohesion and community wellbeing from displacement of individuals, families and communities, and risks off exacerbating and creating inequities due to unequal impacts of climate change, the report found. The Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act 2019 requires a risk assessment at least every six years. Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw, says today's report shows \"the progress this Government has made to solve the climate crisis is essential to creating cleaner and safer communities across New Zealand''. \"Because of this report, we can see clearer than ever that the action our government is taking to reduce emissions is essential for making sure we pass on a safer planet to our children and grandchildren,\" he says. \"Many of the risks we face can be traced back to the failure of previous governments to take any meaningful action to cut our emissions. \"However, whilst most New Zealanders already know that climate change is a problem, what we haven't had until now is complete picture of exactly what the consequences of this previous inaction are,\" Shaw says. \"Whether it's passing zero carbon legislation, fixing the Emissions Trading Scheme, or supporting public institutions to switch to clean energy, we have been working to avoid worst impacts of climate change since the moment this government formed. \"We know the window of opportunity is small and the task is large, but we have shown again and again that we are equal to the challenge ahead,\" Shaw says.", "headline": "National Climate Change Risk Assessment: Report identifies 10 areas needing urgent action", "article_name": "national-climate-change-risk-assessment-report-identifies-10-areas-needing-urgent-action", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/08/national-climate-change-risk-assessment-report-identifies-10-areas-needing-urgent-action.html", "date_published": "2020-08-03 13:13:00", "article_length": 3234, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:19.872552"}

Credits: Video - AM; Images - AM A New Zealand professor says even though the latest climate report is grim, there is still hope if Kiwis, along with the rest of the world, take individual responsibility. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its latest report on Tuesday morning,\u00a0which said the world needs to drastically cut fossil fuel use, grow forests and eat less meat over the next decade to contain global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. Only\u00a0severe emissions cuts across all sectors, from agriculture and transport to energy and buildings, can turn things around, the report says. Ralph Sims, Massey University emeritus professor of renewable energy and climate mitigation, told AM on Tuesday even though the report is grim, it does give solutions on how to tackle the problems the globe is facing. \"We are not all going to\u00a0die. This report does give us solutions on how we can reduce emissions. But the key message from it is we have to start immediately pushing much harder than we have done before,\" he said. Sims said a key part of the report is the focus on individuals needing to make changes. \"This one has put much more emphasis on behavioural change and the co-benefits. So if we try to reduce our carbon footprints personally and New Zealand has one of the highest carbon footprints out of any country in the world [per capita], so we have a commitment to reduce them,\" he told AM. \"Then you get the co-benefits of improved health, less traffic congestion, better local air\u00a0pollution. So we do have a responsibility.\" The\u00a0IPCC report said there are 60 actions\u00a0individuals can take to reduce emissions including\u00a0changing\u00a0what they eat and the type of transport they take, which would have the largest potential to reduce carbon footprints. The report said prioritising car-free travel by walking or cycling and using\u00a0electric transport options\u00a0could save carbon dioxide\u00a0emissions. Other options include reducing air travel and appliance use, shifting to public transit and\u00a0changing to a plant-based diet. The report said tax and fiscal incentives for businesses and individuals could help support\u00a0behavioural\u00a0change towards\u00a0low-carbon choices. Climate Change Minister James Shaw said the ICC report made it clear \"we need a plan now to cut our emissions\". \"The severity with which we will experience climate change can be lessened if we do all we can, right now, to limit warming,\" Shaw said. \"The challenge ahead may feel daunting, but the report also highlights a number of effective and innovative ways we can lower emissions and limit the effects of climate change. And that is exactly what our Emissions Reduction Plan will do at a national level. \nShaw said New Zealand\u2019s climate targets are not optional, but critical. \"There are those who will try and tell you, when it comes to climate change, New Zealand is too small to be counted - this report should well and truly dispel us of that notion. We are part of the problem and we must be part of the solution.\" Sims told AM there are different ways New Zealand can reduce carbon emissions. \"It's not just technology, it's already happening as we are growing more trees and they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow, so they are a carbon sink and we have relied on them for a long time,\" he said. \"Soil carbon - if we can increase the content of carbon in the soil and there are various ways of doing that by increasing organic matter that locks up the carbon in the soil. \"As well as that there is the carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies, which is where from a power station we collect it and store it underground in the disused gas field that has been talked about for a long time.\" He said the carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies come with risk since New Zealand is earthquake-prone. \"If we put it down a hole and put a cover on the top then an earthquake could release it in theory,\" he said. \"If a whole lot of carbon dioxide is released at once it could smother any living organism or people nearby so there is a risk.\" Sims was asked by AM co-host Ryan Bridge if any of the IPCC reports\u00a0state how long until we are going to die because of climate change. \"No it doesn't show you that. It's based on science, it brings all the science together to how we can reduce emissions and it's left up to Governments to develop policies. But he says the signs New Zealand is being affected by climate change are obvious. \"I can tell you that last year in New Zealand alone we spent $340 million on insurance claims against extreme weather events and that doesn't include infrastructure from roading and people who weren't insured, so there is going to be a cost on everybody and there will be a risk in the future of food supplies if there is droughts, floods. \"Those are the sorts of things that will happen over a period of time and it's already started.\"", "headline": "IPCC climate report: Kiwis need to make 'behavioural changes' to help tackle crisis - expert", "article_name": "ipcc-climate-report-kiwis-need-to-make-behavioural-changes-to-help-tackle-crisis-expert", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2022/04/ipcc-climate-report-kiwis-need-to-make-behavioural-changes-to-help-tackle-crisis-expert.html", "date_published": "2022-04-05 09:46:56", "article_length": 4997, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:20.141840"}

They're so bad, German researchers say, they're responsible for more warming than all aviation carbon emissions ever made - from the day the Wright brothers flew their first plane until now. \"Lots of people talk about the need to stop air traffic increasing all the time, but this is not taken that seriously,\" co-author Ulrike Burkhardt  told  New Scientist . Aviation accounts for about 5 percent of the world's carbon emissions. Contrails - a mix of water vapour and impurities from the plane's engine left behind in the cool upper atmosphere - contribute to warming by trapping in more heat than they reflect back into space, a process known as radiative forcing. The researchers modelled the effect contrails would have up until the year 2050, when the skies are expected to be four times busier than they are already. While cleaner fuels will help keep aviation's impact on temperatures in check, the sheer amount of cloud cover formed by contrails will wipe out any gains. \"Overall, the strong increase in radiative forcing from 2006 to 2050 due to larger air traffic volume and the shift in air traffic towards higher altitudes cannot be compensated by small reductions in radiative forcing due to changes expected from climate change, the projected reductions in reduced soot emissions and improvements in fuel efficiency,\" the study read. The researchers say they may even be underestimating contrails' effect on warming by as much as 70 percent. \"It's much harder than [cutting carbon emissions],\" Burkhardt told  New Scientist .

Credits: Image - Getty; Video - The AM Show By Nick Truebridge for RNZ Small businesses like restaurants and cafes could be impacted after the Climate Change Commission released its first report, with a raft of targets proposed to cut New Zealand's emissions. The commission has found the government needs to do more to meet its obligations under the Paris Agreement. And its advice means big changes for New Zealand's small businesses. The sear of a steak is a sound that's here to stay, but how you cook that piece of porterhouse, scotch or eye fillet could be about to change. The Climate Change Commission, in its draft plan for cutting the country's emissions, has advised that it is time to cut gas. Its plan suggests no new natural gas connections to the network or bottled LPG after 2025. By 2050, the commission says existing natural gas in buildings should be phased out. It is not just households that will be impacted. The report says small businesses like restaurants and cafes will need to move away from gas to lower emissions solutions. Wellington chef Martin Bosley says that represents a huge change in mindset for the New Zealand cook. \"Ninety-five percent of restaurants are on gas. That's everything from its hot water through to cooking equipment,\" he said. But what is wrong with electricity and renewable energy sources? And why are such a small fraction of our hospitality businesses using them? \"Gas is efficient, it's quick and controllable. It's immediate. I need to cook your piece of steak and I put a pan on the element, I turn the gas on and it's instantly hot. The pan gets hot and away we go. When I'm finished I turn the gas off, or if I need to slow it down I can, and again it's immediate. \"With electricity, you turn the element on and you have to wait for it to heat up,\" Bosley said. \"It takes longer to do so it's just not a very efficient way of cooking.\" Bosley said electric induction equipment is slowly becoming available for commercial sections, but he describes it as \"prohibitively expensive\" currently. Fitting out a kitchen so it is fully electric would be a mammoth shift for New Zealand restaurants, he said. \"You're going to have to rethink the entire model. The amount of equipment you need, what you need, everything will change. The services, the plumbing requirements, the electrical requirements. And as equipment comes to the end of its natural life and you have to replace it with electrical, do you replace the entire kitchen? Do you do it a piece at a time? It's pretty big.\" Then there's the move away from gas in the home. Professor Philippa Howden-Chapman from Otago University's Department of Public Health said she is in favour of the change, but the country's lowest income households will need help. \"I think it's a good aim, and of course there will need to be some recompense or some subsidy for lower-income houses who have to budget day to day and use LPG canisters. But those need to be phased out and I think the timeframe is reasonable.\" Professor Howden-Chapman says that government assistance would also be needed to help people transition to other lower emitting machines like cars. The commission has also suggested a halt on petrol vehicle importations as early as 2030. Consumer NZ chief executive Jon Duffy says electricity is just as cost-effective and efficient. \"The big thing here is, what we're looking at is new connections. All houses already have a connection to electricity. You can run your house relatively efficiently on electricity and heat your house to a suitable standard, including your water,\" he said. \"So in terms of new connections, people aren't actually losing that much. Electricity is a perfectly suitable alternative to gas.\" The commission's draft advice is now open for consultation until 14 March and final advice will be released before 31 May. The advice includes three emissions budgets. The government said it will release an Emissions Reduction Plan before the end of the year after receiving the final advice, which will set out how the first three emissions budgets will be achieved.

The report warns annual floods could affect areas that are home to 300 million people in just 30 years, if people fail to cut carbon emissions. China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand are the countries most at risk. Climate Central USA's Scott Kulp and Benjamin Strauss, who led the Springer Nature study published in  Nature Communications , used computer modelling to assess global exposure to extreme coastal waters.

The research says most previous estimates of global average sea level rise in the next 100 years have been below 2m. Under scenarios of higher emissions, a rise more than 2m may be possible in the 21st century, the research says. \"Translating sea-level projections into potential exposure of population is critical for coastal planning and for assessing the benefits of climate mitigation, as well as the costs of failure to act.\" Newshub.", "headline": "Climate change warning: Three times more coastal homes may be lost than previously thought", "article_name": "climate-change-warning-three-times-more-coastal-homes-may-be-lost-than-previously-thought", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2019/10/climate-change-warning-three-times-more-coastal-homes-may-be-lost-than-previously-thought.html", "date_published": "2019-10-30 06:17:23", "article_length": 1833, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:20.829710"}

He was given a \"People's seat\" at the two-week UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland, representing the public, and introduced a video compiled from public submissions addressing leaders responses to climate change. Sir David said climate change was an issue that needed to be addressed urgently. \"Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late.\" Limits for global warming were agreed upon in the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, and were intended to prevent mass extinction, rising sea levels and extreme weather events. But the world is currently on track to overshoot these limits greatly. The goal is to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees Celsius. In October, the average global temperature difference was 0.86 degrees Celsius above the 20th century average. The talks in Katowice are part of an effort to outline a set of rules on enforcing action against climate change. Urgency for solutions to rising global temperatures prompted the talks in Poland to begin a day early, on Sunday delegates from almost 200 nations began debates on how best to target the problem. The wider political environment surrounding climate change has changed over the past few years, people becoming fed up with lack of action, and Sir David urged that leaders need to stop talking about, and start implementing change. \"The wave of optimism and global co-operation that carried us to and through Paris has now crested, broken and is now tumbling,\" he said.

{"id": null, "body": "By Joanna Kershaw for The Conversation. Climate change is having a serious impact on the world's oceans in various ways, ranging from its devastating effects on tropical  coral reefs  to melting polar sea ice. But until now, it wasn't known how these changes could be affecting whale populations. Globally,  humpback whales  are increasing in numbers following the  end of commercial whaling , but the populations in the northern hemisphere are not recovering to the same extent as those in the southern hemisphere. Our new  research  confirms that a North Atlantic population has shown a significant decline in the number of calves over the last 15 years. The Gulf of St Lawrence in Quebec, Canada, has experienced major environmental changes as a result of warmer water and a dramatic reduction in sea ice. These changes have knock-on effects for the whole ecosystem where fluctuations at the bottom of the food web can result in decreases in the abundance of species higher up, including the prey of  baleen whales  such as  schooling fish  like herring and capelin. Humpback whales need to feed intensively during the summer to build up the energy reserves to sustain them for the rest of the year while they fast. The Gulf of St Lawrence is an important summer feeding ground for humpback whales that migrate between the cold, productive waters of the North Atlantic and the warmer waters of their Caribbean breeding ground every year. Fewer mothers with calves have been sighted in the Gulf of St Lawrence over the last two decades, so we wanted to investigate if the  major environmental changes  recorded in the area could be affecting their breeding success. Mothers and calves As a team of scientists from the  Sea Mammal Research Unit , we worked with colleagues at the  Mingan Island Cetacean Study  (MICS), an NGO based in Quebec, and the  Department of Fisheries and Oceans  (DFO) in Canada for this interdisciplinary, long-term study. We collected small biopsy samples of blubber from adult female humpback whales between 2004 and 2018 to measure reproductive hormones, and effectively carry out a pregnancy test. Colleagues at MICS were able to identify these females from their markings and follow the same individuals over several decades. So every year we knew if they returned to the Gulf of St Lawrence with a calf. There are only a handful of other whale populations in the world that are studied in such detail. We are the first to combine this long-term information collected over 15 years about their calving rates with pregnancy rates to determine how many pregnancies were successful. We found that humpback whale pregnancy rates were highly variable over the study period, but 39 percent of pregnancies were unsuccessful. Annual calving rates declined significantly from approximately 40 percent to 20 percent over the 15 years. Working with colleagues at DFO, we gathered information on the annual abundance of their prey as well as data on overall environmental productivity. Our study confirmed that changes in these environmental data were linked to the decline in calving rates. The probability of observing mother-calf pairs was related to favourable environmental conditions in the previous year, especially with the abundance of herring, one of their main prey. These results suggest that environmental changes in the Gulf of St Lawrence have resulted in declines in herring abundance, and this is negatively affecting the breeding success of the humpback whales. \n We believe this decline could - at least in part - be the result of females being unable to build up the energy reserves needed to sustain pregnancy and meet the energetic demands of nourishing their young in years of poorer feeding availability. Future of baleen whales It was previously thought that baleen whales could show some  resilience to climate change  because of their ability to change their migratory patterns, or switch prey species, for example, if the location, timing or abundance of their main prey changed. However, our research shows that their ability to respond in these ways may not be enough to prevent their breeding success from being impacted by environmental change. Continued monitoring of this humpback population in the Gulf of St Lawrence is required to assess how the observed decline in calving rates will affect population growth and viability. A study led by researchers at the University of Queensland, Australia, predicted declines in baleen whale populations in the Southern Ocean as a consequence of reduced prey availability such as copepods and krill, and increasing competition between whale species in response to diminishing food stocks caused by climate change. Here, together with studies on  North Atlantic right whales  and  Southern Resident killer whales  we show that the effects of climate change and environmental variability could be already being felt in northern hemisphere whale populations. It is possible that other, less-well studied whale populations are also experiencing declines in their breeding success. While it may not be possible to redress the balance in the short term, what we can do now is minimise other potential stressors on these species, particularly human disturbance, and help them to maximise their ability to reproduce successfully.

The planning comes after NASA reported last month was the warmest April in statistics dating back to the 19th century, the seventh month in a row to break temperature records. The meeting of government experts on Monday is the first since 195 nations reached a deal in Paris in December to limit climate change by shifting from fossil fuels to green energies by 2100. It will begin to work out the detail of the plan. \"The Paris Agreement represents the foundations. Now we have to raise the walls, the roof of a common home,\" French Environment Minister Segolene Royal told a news conference. The agreement sets targets for shifting the world to green energies by 2100 but is vague, for instance, about how governments will report and monitor plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Many government delegates at the start of the week long UN talks in Germany expressed concern about rising temperatures and extremes events such as damage to tropical coral reefs, wildfires in Canada or drought in India. \"We have no other option but to accelerate\" action to limit warming, Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief, told a news conference, asked about the NASA data. She said record temperatures were partly caused by a natural warming effect of an El Nino weather event in the Pacific Ocean, magnified by the build-up of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. She said national promises for curbing greenhouse gases put the world on track for a rise in temperatures of between 2.5C and 3C, well above an agreed ceiling in the Paris text of \"well below\" 2C with a target of 1.5C. \"Certainly we are not yet on the path\" for the Paris temperature targets, she said.

Credits: Video - Newshub Nation; Image -  Three million years ago when temperatures were a few degrees warmer than they are now, the seas were 16m higher. That's the conclusion of  a new study  which looked at deposits left in coastal caves inundated during the Pliocene. \"Constraining models for sea level rise due to increased warming critically depends on actual measurements of past sea level,\" said researcher Victor Polyak of the University of New Mexico. \"This study provides very robust measurements of sea-level heights during the Pliocene.\" Between 3 million and 3.2 million years ago, temperatures were about 2C to 3C warmer than they were before the Industrial Revolution.\u00a0 \"The interval also marks the last time the Earth's atmospheric CO2 was as high as today, providing important clues about what the future holds in the face of current anthropogenic warming,\" said University of South Florida geoscience professor Bogdan Onac. Since the revolution, the Earth's atmosphere has risen about 1C. If it keeps rising, scientists predict there will be stronger storms, increasingly erratic weather and more droughts. Sea levels will rise as the ice sheets melt, and  due to thermal expansion  - warm water takes up more room than cold. Even if humanity managed to halt the rising temperatures where they are now, the scientists behind the new research say a sea level rise between 5.6m and 19.2m could still happen, based on their measurements. \"Considering the present-day melt patterns, this extent of sea level rise would most likely be caused by a collapse of both Greenland and the West Antarctic ice sheets,\" said PhD student Oana Dumitru of the University of South Florida, who led the research. Four million years ago, when temperatures were 4C above where they are now, the scientists measured sea levels more than 23m above where they are now. \"This is a possible scenario, if active and aggressive reduction in green house gases into the atmosphere is not undertaken,\" said Professor Yemane Asmerom of the University of New Mexico.\u00a0 The UN estimates the seas  will rise only about 65cm by the end of this century , but admits that is a \"conservative\" estimate.

I'm not talking about binge drinking, gambling or domestic violence - I'm talking instead about climate change. A survey this year of 9000 people found one in eight Kiwis don't believe humans are to blame. My esteemed colleague Peter Williams, the Magic Talk host, is one of those concerned.  He asks why the sceptics are labelled as deniers,  and why questions cannot be asked.\u00a0 He's right - we should all be allowed to ask questions. But some questions have answers, which should not be ignored. Peter says today's \"climate deniers\" are compared to those who denied the holocaust. The difference, he says, is the physical proof. \"The thing is, we know the Holocaust happened. We have physical evidence of graves, of concentration camps, of gas chambers and of people being loaded onto trains to go there and never be seen again.\" But we also have real, physical evidence of how greenhouse gases are changing the world. The level of C02 in the atmosphere is measured from the air all around us - you cannot see it, but it's physical proof. It tells us C02 in the Earth's atmosphere has dramatically increased in the last two centuries, to levels not seen in 3 million years. Peter asks why we should care about 3 million-year records. After all, the Earth is 4.5 billion years old. But our societies - and our species - did not exist in those conditions. Modern humans evolved 200,000 years ago. The livestock and crops we rely on for food have been farmed for only the last 12,000. And the cities of Miami, New York and Dunedin - cities put at risk by rising sea levels - are mere hundreds of years in age. Extreme weather, drought, food shortages and rising tides were of little concern 3 million years ago. The result of all this extra carbon also has real, physical proof. It's called the greenhouse gas effect, and it's been known to science since 1896. Most of the planet's atmosphere is nitrogen and oxygen, gases which have little effect on heat. But greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane don't allow heat to pass through them - instead, they reflect it back to the Earth. More greenhouse gases means higher temperatures. It is simple cause and effect. Physical data also tells us the Earth's average temperature has risen nearly 1C since 1880. It tells us we just sweated through the hottest June on record, and 2015-2018 was the warmest four years on record too. He asks why the Earth has been through warm and cool periods over the last 2000 years. If the Earth can naturally grow warmer and cooler, how do we know this change is our fault? This question, too, has an answer. Scientists do believe there was a Medieval Warm Period beginning around 1000 years ago. It was followed by what's called the Little Ice Age, which ended about 160 years ago. But the change the world has seen since 1880 is dramatically faster. Between 950AD and 1850 temperatures changed by fractions of a degree. The change since 1880 is bigger, and instead of taking a millennium, it's occurred in 140 years. What's changed? An explosion of greenhouse gases, caused by humans, which isn't slowing down. Those who have questions should always ask them. But they should come prepared to listen to the answers - otherwise \"denial\" seems a fitting word.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Images - Getty New Zealand only managed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 1 percent between 2007 and 2018, new data shows. The deep south is largely to blame, with Canterbury, Otago, Tasman/Nelson and Southland increasing their emissions, while every North Island region reduced theirs - with the exception of Bay of Plenty. \"Industrial emissions, from either primary industries, goods-producing industries, or service industries, can be affected by a number of factors, such as structural changes to the local economy, changes in technology, or efficiency gains,\" said Stats NZ environmental-economic accounts manager Stephen Oakley. \"This is the first comprehensive picture we have been able to develop to show where emissions are being produced in New Zealand and which regions are driving the changes in emissions.\" Auckland - which contributes most to the New Zealand economy of any region - was only the third-highest emitter, and had the biggest fall in emissions over the years covered. Wellington - the second-biggest local economy in the country - was the ninth-highest emitter.\u00a0 \"This demonstrates that regions with higher levels of economic activity don't always have higher emissions,\" said Oakley. Auckland's reduction of 955 kilotonnes (kt) a year was closely followed by Taranaki (707kt), Northland (545kt) and Waikato (272kt).\u00a0 Canterbury led the charge in the other direction, increasing its emissions by 1175kt a year. Bay of Plenty came in second, up 356kt, followed by Southland (335kt) and Otago (333kt).\u00a0 \"While some regions reduced their emissions, this was largely offset by increased emissions in other regions,\" said Oakley. \"Overall, this resulted in a reduction of just over 1 percent in New Zealand's total greenhouse gas emissions between 2007 and 2018.\" New Zealand's population has grown about 18 percent in that time, so our per capita emissions have dropped. This is  backed up by data from the World Bank , which shows per capita emissions dropping in the past two decades, since peaking in 2001.\u00a0 Overall net emissions peaked a few years later  in 2006, according to Stats NZ data.\u00a0 The overall biggest emitter in 2018 was Waikato, a big farming region. \"Service industries produce fewer emissions per unit of GDP than primary and goods-producing industries meaning they are less emissions intensive,\" Stats NZ said. \"Service industries include wholesale trade; retail trade; transport, postal, and warehousing; government and defence; and health care and social assistance. Conversely, primary industries, such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and mining, generally have higher emissions intensities.\" Every region's biggest emitter were primary industries except in Auckland, where it was goods-producing industries - manufacturing, electricity, gas, water, and waste services and construction. Auckland's big drop was driven by a massive fall in emissions in goods-producing industries, but offset slightly by a rise in service industry and household emissions.\u00a0 \"The rise in Auckland's household emissions is largely due to its growing population, leading to increased car emissions, and increased fuel use,\" said Oakley. The massive rises in Canterbury and Otago were driven by expanding cattle numbers. Auckland, Waikato and Canterbury accounted for almost half of all emissions between them. Sparsely populated Marlborough, Tasman/Nelson, West Coast and Gisborne had the least.\u00a0 Auckland generated the most carbon dioxide, while Canterbury produced the most methane - a far bigger driver of climate change in the short-term - and nitrous oxide. Southland's emissions were eight times higher per capita than in Auckland and Wellington.\u00a0 \"The new data allows regions to better understand the emissions intensity of their economies,\" said Oakley. \"It will also be of interest as regions look to reduce their emissions while managing economic outcomes, thereby transitioning to a lower-emissions economy.\" The Government has a goal of New Zealand being carbon-neutral by 2050.\u00a0", "headline": "Climate change: Which regions are reducing their emissions, and which aren't?

Credits: Image - Newshub; Video - The AM Show Judith Collins is the new leader of National after the party accepted Todd Muller's resignation and backed her to take over on Tuesday. It's been a tumultuous road to the helm for Collins, a role she's put herself forward for twice before - one fraught with resignations, troublesome tweets and  Dirty Politics . But she's arrived now, and believes there are no skeletons left in the closet. \"If anyone's gone through having all their emails gone through, all their phone records and everything else for years\u2026 I think we're perfectly fine,\" she told Magic Talk on Wednesday. \"If someone wants to try something, fine. I'm ready for them. I'm focused on the people of New Zealand, I'm not worrying about the sort of muckrakers we've dealt with in the past.\" Need a reminder of what Collins has dished up in the past? Below are the biggest controversies of her political career. Judith Collins was accused in 2014 of  a conflict of interest with Oravida bosses  - a company where her husband was a director - and a Chinese official. During a taxpayer-funded visit to China in her role as Justice Minister in 2013,  Collins was welcomed into the New Zealand export company  and endorsed the milk it produced. Prime Minister John Key criticised the visit, causing Collins to apologise. However she said the Chinese official - who she refused to name - was a \"very close personal friend\". She also claimed it was \"not necessarily true\" that her husband would benefit financially from the company doing well, as he wasn't a shareholder. Key told media Collins was on her final warning over the incident - but she  maintained she had Key's permission  to meet with the company. Also in 2014, Collins found herself  embroiled in the scandal sparked by Nicky Hager's  Dirty Politics  - an explosive book that had an entire chapter devoted to her alleged unscrupulous tactics. The book makes a variety of claims, including that she helped get an inmate moved as a favour to right-wing blogger Cameron Slater, and that she passed on  private information to him about public servant Simon Pleasants . Slater then used the information in an attack post on his blog, which drew death threats against Pleasants, an Internal Affairs staffer. The book also alleged\u00a0that Collins gave confidential details to Slater about the Bronwyn Pullar ACC leak. Allegations about Collins in Hager's book  ranged from leaks of confidential Government information to smear campaigns. To top off a disastrous year, Collins resigned in 2014 following the release of a 2011 email in which Cameron Slater insinuated Collins was out to get another public servant. In this, the email said,  Collins was \"gunning for\" Adam Feeley  - the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), an agency she was the appointed minister for. Collins denied any wrongdoing, but stood down as an MP because she believed her presence in Parliament was distracting from National's 2014 election campaign. She requested an inquiry into the matter so she could clear her name, and in November that year the  Chisholm report cleared of the allegations . Collins was reinstated to Prime Minister John Key's Cabinet and the portfolios of Corrections and Police in December 2015. 'Crusher' Collins has a reputation as someone who speaks her mind - but that can, on occasion, go too far. Before she became Prime Minister, Hager's  Dirty Politics  revealed Collins had referred to Ardern as 'My Little Pony' in emails with Slater. Ardern  laughed off the insult  in an interview with Stuff in 2015, and  in 2017 responded with humour to an anonymous correspondent  who sent her a letter reading: \"Who would vote for a woman who has a mouth like a horse (or donkey)?\" Collins is no stranger to the odd controversial comment on social media. In November 2019, Collins  described herself as a \"woman of colour\"  in a now-deleted tweet in response to a Bill introduced to Parliament to ban female genital mutilation. \"MPs band together for female genital mutilation ban,\" she wrote. \"I am a woman of colour - the colour white - and I fully support a ban on this mutilation inflicted on women.\" Collins later apologised , revealing a staffer had convinced her it was insulting and should be taken down. \"I wasn't trying to offend anybody,\" she told The AM Show. \"I was trying to be empathetic and you know, even I - just occasionally - can make an error. Only very, very occasionally.\" Collins has repeatedly asked if there's  \"something wrong with being white\"  in response to questions about ethnic representation in the National Party. Her comments about race were  passionately criticised in Parliament  by\u00a0M\u0101ori Labour MP Peeni Henare earlier this year. It wasn't Collins' first questionable act on social media. In June 2018, she 'liked' a tweet that likened Labour to \"a virus\" and described the party as  the home of \"academics, gays and greens\" . Rainbow Youth executive director Frances Arns said Collins' online support of the message was \"really sad\". \"The suggestion that queer people are a parasite on our society is hugely disappointing,\" she said. Collins said she couldn't see the offence in it. When asked whether she believed the tweet inferred gay people are not decent and hardworking, she said it wasn't her interpretation. Less than two months after liking the 'Labour gays' tweet, Collins misfired again on Twitter - sharing an article on a known fake news website to take aim at Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. She had challenged Ardern to denounce French child abuse laws, tweeting the article to hammer home her point - but the  article was from a website famous for fake news  and conspiracy theories, home to claims Katy Perry is a cannibal and Justin Bieber a shapeshifter. \"I'm not worried about people saying it's not a legitimate website when it clearly is a website - but is the story legitimate or not?\" Ms Collins said. \"It seems that the story is legitimate.\" That's despite the article claiming France's child rape laws are a campaign by liberal activists to legitimise paedophilia around the world. Asked in July 2019 if climate change was caused by humans,  Collins said she didn't know . \"I presume it is. I'm personally not adding to it - I only had one [child],\" she told host AM Show host Ryan Bridge. The comment came after the Government proposed a scheme lowering the cost of electric and fuel-efficient vehicles. Collins said she's \"sick of everyone having to feel virtuous\". When asked if she believed scientists who say climate change is driven by human activity, Collins said \"some of it\" would be. \"Clearly not volcanoes. Volcanoes clearly do help towards climate change, affect climate change, but they are definitely not manmade.\" Volcanoes emit less than 1 percent  of the greenhouse gas emissions released by humans, according to scientists. Last year Collins also penned an  impassioned Facebook post  about her stance on global warming, which was  questioned by experts in the field .", "headline": "Judith Collins' biggest controversies: Troublesome tweets, resignations and Dirty Politics", "article_name": "judith-collins-biggest-controversies-troublesome-tweets-resignations-and-dirty-politics", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/07/judith-collins-biggest-controversies-troublesome-tweets-resignations-and-dirty-politics.html", "date_published": "2020-07-15 16:55:00", "article_length": 7059, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:25.755520"}

A single trip aboard a SpaceX Falcon rocket has about the same carbon footprint as flying across the Atlantic 395 times,  according to analysis by travel website Champion Traveler . That's equivalent to the average output of 73 cars over an entire year. \"These emissions represent a tiny fraction of the human race's yearly CO2 output,\" the site said in a recent post. \"But... 1000s of rockets per month carrying scientific or governmental payloads as well as a steady stream of space tourists - the environmental impact will be much greater.\" At the moment, SpaceX - run by eccentric tech guru Elon Musk - sends a couple of dozen flights to space a year, but plans to ramp that up dramatically. And SpaceX isn't the only company hoping to cash in on space tourism, with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin at various stages of development. \"This reporting is not meant as a nay-say on rocket launches or space travel in general,\" Champion Traveler said. \"But as rocket launches become more common and space tourism accelerates... companies such as SpaceX will need to consider the environmental impact of their launches at scale.\" Musk has predicted it would take 1000 rockets to transport enough crew and cargo to set up a viable colony on Mars.\u00a0 The aviation industry presently  dumps about 900 million tonnes of carbon dioxide  into the atmosphere every year.

Greta spoke to reporters after crowds eagerly awaited her arrival in Manhattan. \"My message for [US President Donald Trump] is just listen to the science... no one has been able to convince him about the climate crisis, the urgency, then why should I be able to do that?\" the 16-year-old told reporters, according to Reuters. \"I'm just going to focus on spreading awareness.\" The 16-year-old is known for inspiring a global movement after she started missing school on Fridays to protest again political inaction on climate change. Her actions inspired youth around the world to do the same, Reuters reports. She said she wanted to show the world \"climate change is a real thing\" when she set out on her travels two weeks ago.\u00a0 Greta will attend the UN summit on September 24. She will also appear at the COP25 climate conference in Chile in December. \n Newshub.", "headline": "Climate change activist Greta Thunberg arrives in New York after two-week sail from the UK", "article_name": "climate-change-activist-greta-thunberg-arrives-in-new-york-after-two-week-sail-from-the-uk", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2019/08/climate-change-activist-greta-thunberg-arrives-in-new-york-after-two-week-sail-from-the-uk.html", "date_published": "2019-08-29 19:10:10", "article_length": 1776, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:27.052961"}

Credits: Image - Getty; Video - Newshub A climate scientist is describing Judith Collins as 'complacent' after she lashed out at the \"political left\" for \"hugely\" overstating the impacts of climate change.\u00a0 The National MP aired her frustrations in a Facebook post on Sunday night, telling her 21,000 followers there are a \"few home truths that no-one on the political left, and few on the right, are willing to discuss\". She said despite the rhetoric in some reports warning of catastrophe, the world \"will not end\" if global warming is not limited to 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels. \"There is a major 'reality gap' in the debate on global warming,\" Collins said. \"I believe this has been allowed to manifest as a result of any politician, scientist or economist who questions global warming policy instantly being ostracised as the equivalent as a global warming 'denier'.\" She said while the costs of global warming are \"real\", there is \"no indication they are insurmountable\". Victoria University of Wellington Professor James Renwick, a weather and climate researcher, told Newshub \"that may be\" true today.\u00a0 But he said warming above 1.5degC would \"displace millions more people, would threaten a much greater range of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and would increase risks across energy, food, and water sectors\".\u00a0 Collins made reference to an October 2018 report about global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations body made up of the world's best experts on the topic.\u00a0 It said if Earth warms by 2degC, hundreds of thousands of species could go extinct, natural environments will die and coastal communities will be flooded out of existence. Its key finding was that meeting a 1.5degC target is possible but would require \"deep emissions reductions\" and \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\". New Zealand agreed to help keep global average temperatures below 2degC and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5degC, when it signed up to the Paris Agreement in 2015. Collins doubts that goal can be met, saying despite New Zealand's efforts, there is \"almost no chance\" the world will avoid reaching 1.5degC. The IPCC report does say that global warming will likely rise to 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052 if warming continues to increase at the current rate. But some scientists are more optimistic. When the report came out, NIWA scientist Dr Jonny Williams said maintaining temperatures below 1.5degC will be \"challenging, but certainly not impossible\". Victoria University Professor Dave Frame told Newshub it's \"certainly true\" that 2degC looks tough and 1.5degC looks \"very unlikely\", but it \"may be better to confront it head-on than to pretend it away\".\u00a0 He also pointed to  research showing that it's not geophysically impossible .\u00a0 Collins pointed to the IPCC's finding that even if all of the ambitions under the Paris Agreement were implemented, it would not limit global warming to 1.5degC. It says the ambitions would lead to global greenhouse gas emissions of 52-58 billion tonnes of CO2 per year by 2030, but the reduction needed is about half of that: 25-30 billion tonnes by 2030. \"There is almost zero chance the globe will achieve such a reduction,\" Collins said. Renwick agreed that the pledges made in the Paris Agreement \"do not get us\" to 2degC. But he said doing nothing at all would put us at 4degC.\u00a0 \"Above two degrees of warming, we lock in the irreversible melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet, guaranteeing around 5 metres of sea level rise over coming centuries, with around 1 metre by the end of this century.\" Collins said it is \"fantasy land\" to think that \"after 30 years of negotiations, countries like China, Brazil and India, who are rightfully focused on poverty eradication, are going to suddenly sacrifice economic development for climate change\".\u00a0 Renwick said, \"Sadly, she may be right.\"\u00a0 But he added, \"Leadership is what is required urgently, not the complacent attitude displayed by Judith Collins.\" Frame praised National MPs who have shown a \"good grasp of the problem\", pointing to climate change spokesperson Todd Muller and former minister Tim Groser.\u00a0 \"There are a few MPs and ex-MPs who embrace climate scepticism and sometimes even outright climate denial. Those positions are at least as far from the evidence as the ones Collins is critiquing.\" Collins suggested it's problematic that the Zero Carbon Bill - which is yet to have its second reading - would create a legally binding objective to limit global warming to no more than 1.5degC with a net zero carbon approach. She said the \"problem\" is that \"the likely impacts of climate change are being hugely overstated by the media and political left\". She also said there is a \"massive gap between what politicians say they think the world should do and the plain reality of global emissions\". Collins took aim at Climate Change Minister and Greens co-leader James Shaw, criticising him for labelling National's \"political opposition\" as the new \"climate denialism\" in his speech at this year's Green Party Conference. \"I can't accept the proposal we are expected to just never question any legislation that has the aim of reducing emissions, no matter what the cost, simply for moral reasons,\" Collins said. \"Economists and politicians have to be allowed to offer considered and balanced perspectives.\" Shaw said he would not engage in a debate about \"these thoroughly debunked ideas\". \"I'm going to stay focused on the policy work to keep us below 1.5degC of warming, so that we don't lapse into an irreversible feedback loop of warming that puts us at risk.\" Frame said Shaw was out of line to call any criticism of Green views \"the new denialism\".\u00a0 But he said it is \"pretty clear that pretending the problem away isn't working, and its failure is more manifest by the year\".\u00a0 National leader Simon Bridges said Collins is \"right\". \"This isn't an emergency, I don't think... We need practical, sensible actions, but we're not going to sit by and let our economy be ruined by radical, meaningless proposals... We're not going to see farm production go down the toilet.\" He said National will be pushing back on some aspects of the Zero Carbon Bill before offering more support, such as the methane reduction target. The Climate Change Response (Zero-Carbon) Amendment Bill would require methane emissions to be reduced by at least 10 percent by 2030 and between 24 and 47 percent by 2050. \"The methane target is unrealistically high... There is not enough regard for the economic impact of change.\" The Bill's second reading is expected in the next fortnight.

{"id": null, "body": "Watch: Billy Fleming on architecture for climate change.  Credits: Newshub. Safeguarding New Zealand against the devastating impact of climate change could mean seizing the means of production. US landscape architect Billy Fleming has a radical vision for the country's future if it's going to survive rising sea levels and extreme weather, and it involves the dreaded s-word: socialism. The former Obama policy advisor, who now heads an urban ecology thinktank at the University of Pennsylvania, is in New Zealand as the Festival of Architecture's keynote speaker. Speaking to Newshub in a hotel overlooking Auckland Harbour, the Arkansas native is concerned about the long-term tenability of the waterfront. \"I look out and see all of this new construction, all these new buildings, all of this incredible vibrant amenity along the waterfront, and I wonder where all the protection for these very important investments are as well,\" he says. \"It's hard to imagine all these things remaining in place as they are now without that second layer of protection down the road as well.\" When it comes to what that protection might look like, one of Fleming's suggestions echoes his home country's current climate-change-denying leader: build a wall. \"So much of Auckland is right up against the water and on fill, so a lot of the terrain is quite soft. You're probably going to need walls.\" Holland keeps the rising seas at bay through the use of dikes and drainage canals along the Dutch coastline, but Auckland will require more robust structures including pumps to drain seawater when it encroaches on the city. But Fleming, who was struck by Auckland's sprawling low-density housing areas during his first visit here, says it's not just the CBD that will be affected. \"I do wonder what the region might think about doing for the parts of the city that are\u2026 in areas that will be close to underwater in a few years as sea levels rise, and where the investments are a lot harder to justify because you don't have the concentration of valuable urban amenities.\" New Zealand finds itself in the same position a lot of smaller island nations are in. Most of our population lives along the coast which will become more flood-prone, due to both rising seas and more extreme storms. But when living at the waterfront becomes impossible, where do those people go? \"You're not in the position Australia or Canada are where they have lots of land you can imagine people moving to as sea levels encroach,\" Fleming says. \"That process in other places will be incredibly expensive and politically fraught and hard, but they have the option of thinking about that. \"That's much harder to imagine in New Zealand, and it's why I think a city like Auckland will have to think seriously about how it armours and protects its coast in a way cities like Miami or New Orleans or Houston might not have to.\" Tony van Raat, festival director and head of architecture at Unitec, says he wanted this year's festival to delve into the existential issue of climate change to enable the public to \"differentiate good design from bad\". He says New Zealand is ideally placed to carve out a reputation as a model climate community - but we're not doing anywhere near enough to earn that yet. \"We suffer from an advantage which is also a disadvantage: we're a relatively small population on a large landmass, we have a benevolent climate and therefore we haven't had to try very hard to meet the standards that are now demanded of us.\" Our cities need visionary urban design, combining innovative public transport with more 'green spaces', pre-fabs and low-carbon buildings. \"We need urban and suburban environments which are both more complex in terms of sophisticated technologies but also simpler, in that we can live closer to nature.\" He says that vision must extend to social housing to keep climate solutions democratic and accessible, citing the first Labour Government of 1935 as a success story. Thanks to thoughtful design and well-built structures, much of its ambitious state housing programme is still standing. Van Raat says Fleming is \"completely aligned\" with the issues currently being worked through by New Zealand designers, embracing the fusion of social sciences with architecture and opening those innovations up to the public. For Fleming, socialism is inextricable from the issue of climate change. Capitalism, with its relentless growth demanding more and more of the Earth's resources, is inherently incompatible with sustained human life. Things need to change, and they need to change fast. \"We're going to have to do a whole lot of things really quickly, faster than we've ever done them, better designed than ever, and we're going to have to balance that with a very real need to make sure there's deliberation and public ownership over that process,\" he says. \"Part of that means discarding the idea that markets can solve all of these problems for us, which is not a radical statement at all in most parts of the world, but in the United States is something that gets you thrown out of rooms.\" The housing market has been completely turned over to the private sector, which means any 'managed retreat' from vulnerable coastlines will mirror society's current wealth inequality: the wealthy will be able to up and move inland when the time comes, leaving the working class to fend for themselves. \"It will play out that way in every scenario where we let the private sector determine who gets to stay and where they go when they leave,\" he says. \"The state has a really important role to play in managing the retreat from the coast. If we leave this up to the folks who fund private development, the real estate developers who design and build it, and we call architects in at the end to design beautiful things for the rich and don't do anything else, then we know who wins and loses in that scenario.\" Fleming is a vocal proponent of the Green New Deal, the ambitious legislation put forward by progressive politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and says urban design will play a key role. \"The Green New Deal built around three pillars: decarbonising the economy, climate adaptation and social justice to centre those most affected by climate change,\" he explains.\u00a0 \"All three of those things imply a very radical restructuring of our built and natural environment: our public works, where and how we live.\" While most architects are happy to sit on the fence and call themselves apolitical, Fleming is insistent on the need for his contemporaries to be more involved in a radical rethinking of the urban landscape. \"If we come to the table now, we can think through these huge projects\u2026 we can do much more on the front end to understand how the world we build through a Green New Deal might be more sustainable, more just and more democratic than the system we have now.\" And it's not just those who \"wear black and talk about architecture with a capital A\" that should be more engaged with design. Fleming says because design touches every aspect of our lives, everyday citizens benefit from being involved. \"People are hungry for ways to plug into some kind of response to climate change. That's why you get people who are so gung-ho about metal straws. It's a signal that there are people who are hungry for change on the climate, and there's a paucity of options for them to plug into a vision of what the world might look like.\" The US is seeing a growing resurgence of socialism as a viable political ideology, particularly among the young. Fleming hopes people around the world can get past the mental images of gulags and bread lines and embrace the beauty of design for the many, not the few. \"If you think about the way the right talks about design, they always say that if we were to leave design up to social democracies or democratic socialists you end up with a bunch of boring grey boxes. But actually that's what the right, when they're in power, is building - really boring stuff like strip malls that look the same everywhere you go.\" He cites Red Vienna - Austria's temporary socialist utopia that briefly flourished between the First and Second World Wars - as a shining example of state-built social housing that didn't compromise on visual beauty. \"When you starve the public sector of resources, you get bad public projects. When the public sector is strong and there are resources for good design, you get good design.

In a  remarkably fact-free opinion piece on newshub.co.nz recently , radio presenter Peter Williams asked \"Why is it that not just Stuff, but it seems all media in this country refuse to allow even a skerrick of evidence that CO2 may not be the cause of the Earth's warming?\" Possibly because we know for sure that increasing levels of carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gas) is the cause of climate change over the past century. In the same vein, we might ask why no one challenges the nature of electricity (may not be electrons), or the force of gravity (may not be the curvature of space-time). It is because our scientific understanding of these things is well established, and well understood. The understanding of the science is so good that prediction of global temperature change made in the 1980s, 30 or 40 years ago (some of those predictions made by oil companies) have proved to be spot-on. But absolutely, the technology is always improving. Just like today's phones are streets ahead of those in the 1980s, so climate models are way more sophisticated these days. Not only can they tell us how global temperatures are changing, they can tell us about monsoon rainfall, the Amazon rainforest, storms over the southern oceans, and how extreme events are changing worldwide.\u00a0 The difference between today's climate models and those from 30 years ago is like the difference between black and white and colour TV, just as Peter Williams remarks. Yes, climate has changed in the past, telling us that the climate system is sensitive. The two things it is sensitive to are the amount of sunlight falling on the earth, and the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Those two things explain the ice ages and most other ups and downs of the climate for millions of years. Right now, sunlight is hardly changing, while greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere are going up sharply.  Chemical analysis  tells us the increase is coming from human activity, mostly burning fossil fuels. History, and basic physics, tells us that the climate must warm in response. I have yet to meet a climate scientist active in the research field who disagrees with the physics of climate change laid down over a century ago. Yes, there are a handful of spokespeople who argue against that science, without having a convincing alternative. Many are funded by the oil industry,  as documented in books such as Merchants of Doubt . \n Climate change is the biggest threat humanity has ever faced, and action is urgent. If we take no action, warming will surge through 1.5C, then 2C, 3C, maybe 4C by 2100. That would lock in widespread drought, heatwaves, crop failures, and multi-metre sea level rise. The damage to the global economy and to human society would be almost incalculable. But, we can avoid the worst of it by taking action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, starting immediately.

Credits: Video - The AM Show; Image - Getty Looking after the land will be vital for tackling climate change, a  sprawling new report  compiled by scientists from around the world says. But Kiwi farmers say they're already leading the world in terms of sustainable farming.\u00a0 The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Friday released its latest report on the climate, this one with a focus on how land use is driving change and what needs to be done to mitigate the negative impacts.\u00a0 More than 7000 studies were analysed for the report, Lincoln University associate professor of agribusiness and economics Anita Wreford, told The AM Show on Friday. \"The role of the IPCC is to synthesise all of the existing research that's emerging in this area, and condense it in a way that's accessible for policymakers... presenting them with their options and the consequences of the decisions that they make.\" Dr Wreford was the only New Zealander to contribute to the report - for the first time in IPCC history, the majority of scientists who worked on it were from developing countries, which are most at risk from climate change.\u00a0 \n \"Roughly 500 million people live in areas that experience desertification\" since the 1980s, the IPCC said in a statement. \"Drylands and areas that experience desertification are also more vulnerable to climate change and extreme events including drought, heatwaves, and dust storms, with an increasing global population providing further pressure.\" The report says agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23 percent of human greenhouse gas emissions. More than 70 percent of all land that isn't covered in ice is used by humans in some capacity, it says. Dr Wreford said the report has a big focus on sustainable land management, but farmers will be relieved to hear they're not the only ones in the firing line. \"The report is quite careful to not focus only on farming systems. So it does identify options for farmers to reduce their impacts on the environment, and New Zealand farmers are probably very well aware of lots of these mechanisms.\u00a0 \"But what the report really also does is look at the food system as a whole, and emphasises that we all have a role to play in the food choices that we make, and the food that we waste as well. If we reduce the amount of food waste, it can take a lot of pressure off the land.\" The report estimates as much as 30 percent of all food produced goes to waste - if this was cut, emissions would be reduced. \n \"Food security will be increasingly affected by future climate change through yield declines - especially in the tropics - increased prices, reduced nutrient quality, and supply chain disruptions,\" said Priyadarshi Shukla, co-chair of IPCC Working Group III. \"Some dietary choices require more land and water, and cause more emissions of heat-trapping gases than others,\" said Debra Roberts, co-chair of IPCC Working Group II. \"Balanced diets\u00a0 featuring plant-based foods, such as coarse grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, and animal-sourced food produced sustainably in low greenhouse gas emission systems, present major opportunities for adaptation to and limiting climate change.\" Federated Farmers vice-president Andrew Hoggard told The AM Show the IPCC's report effectively holds up New Zealand as a model to the world. \"Effectively they're suggesting New Zealand-style grazing management needs to be adopted around the world. It's not about going plant-based - it's about being more efficient.\" Dr Wreford said it's not just food choices that have an impact. \"The report isn't telling people what food choices they should make, but it does present the information that what we choose to eat... and purchase in terms of our timber and paper and things like that as well, all have implications on the land and the pressure that we put on the land.\"\u00a0 \"Some food choices put less pressure on our land and water. In some areas that might be moving away from meat and dairy towards more plant-based diets, but it really does depend on the locally specific context.\" The report says low population growth will also help, as will reducing inequality.\u00a0 Dr Wreford said New Zealand's  Zero Carbon Bill  is \"on the right track\", but \"certainly not being too ambitious\". \"We kind of know what we need to do, and delaying those actions is going to result in it being more costly in the long-term, and we'll run out of options... We only have a small window of time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\" Hoggard said while the report notes what needs to be done globally, not all of it is relevant for New Zealand policymakers. \"These reports are focused on the globe, not any specific country. We've got to recognise that difference - that we're already doing quite well.\" NIWA principal scientist Mike Harvey also said New Zealand is doing its bit \"We are already thinking about how to minimise our emissions, how the future of agriculture might look under a lower-emissions scenario,\" he told Newshub.

Royal Society President Professor Richard Bedford\u00a0says people need to become \"personally involved\" in the fight. \"All New Zealanders need to understand the threats of climate change, accept that we need to change the way we act, realise there are trade-offs that will need to be made, and become personally involved in implementing mitigation solutions. \"The sooner we make changes, the more likely it is that we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\" One of New Zealand's major contributors to carbon emissions is the huge agriculture industry, which makes nearly half our total emissions, and there's no quick fix. But adopting 'best practices', selectively breeding and biologically modifying the digestive systems of sheep and cows could reduce our emissions, without having to reduce our reliance on meat and milk production. Another large contributor to our greenhouse emissions is the nation's dependence on coal, oil and gas for electricity, industrial heating processes, transport and everyday activities in homes and commercial buildings. If use of renewable energy such as solar panels and hydroelectric power is increased from 80 percent to 90 percent by 2025, something the Royal Society says is feasible, it would result in fewer emissions being produced. Ninety-nine percent of the transport industry is dependent on fossil fuels. More fuel-efficient vehicles and low-carbon vehicles would also be beneficial, alongside improving public transport and urban design to encourage cycling and walking. And while planting more forests would be a good carbon-sink in the short time, it's not a reliable long-term solution, the report says. \"It is an effective strategy in the short to medium term while other sectors transition to low-carbon technologies,\" Prof Sims says.

{"id": null, "body": "Simon Kingham for The Conversation The COVID-19 lockdown has affected the environment in a number of ways. \n The first is a  reduction in air travel  and associated emissions. Globally,  air travel accounts for around 12  percent of the transport sector\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and this was predicted to rise. An ongoing reduction in air travel would lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions. The lockdown has also meant less travel by road, which has resulted in measurably lower vehicle emissions and  cleaner air  in New Zealand. Worldwide, daily emissions of carbon dioxide had  dropped by 17 percent by early April  (compared with 2019 levels) and just under half of the reduction came from changes in land transport. The same study estimated the pandemic could reduce global emissions by between 4 percent(if the world returns to pre-pandemic conditions mid-year) and 7 percent (if restrictions remain in place until the end of 2020). But even a 7 percent drop would mean emissions for 2020 will  roughly be the same as in 2011 . The long-term impact of the pandemic on climate change depends on the actions governments take as economies recover \u2013 they will influence the path of global carbon dioxide emissions for decades. \u00a0 In New Zealand, the biggest reduction in emissions came from people not travelling as much, or at all. But as the lockdown lifted, these  improvements seemed to be short term , with traffic volumes and the associated pollution now  back at pre-COVID-19 levels . There is significant uncertainty about all of the changes prompted by the pandemic lockdown, but international air travel is predicted to remain down in the short to medium term as the risk of inter-country transfer of COVID-19 remains high. For how long depends on the ability of other countries to effectively manage the virus or the availability of a vaccine. Land transport is more within our control in New Zealand. How, and how much, we choose to travel will determine our greenhouse gas emissions. While many people are returning to their cars, there are some lockdown changes that could lead to longer-term emissions reductions. Firstly, people now realise it is  possible to work from home  and may want to continue doing so in the future. Secondly, there is  evidence some people   walked and cycled more  than they had done before during lockdown. Retailers are reporting  increased demand for bicycles . \u00a0 In many parts of the world, governments are implementing plans to lock in some of the reductions in traffic caused by the pandemic. This includes allocating road space  to walking and cycling  and incentives for people to buy or maintain bikes (such as in  France  and the  UK ). There are also initiatives to decarbonise the car fleet by replacing fossil fuelled vehicles with  electric ones . In New Zealand, electric vehicles are  exempt from road user charges  and the government is investigating ways to increase the uptake of  alternative fuels in the road freight industry . These measures are important and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but they are not designed to reduce the number of people travelling, or the mode they use. Congestion is an ongoing issue in Auckland and is now estimated to cost more than  NZ$1 billion per year . Another challenge is the growing rate of obesity, with  one in three New Zealanders  now obese. This is at least partly a transport-related challenge. We know  obesity rates are higher  in places where more people travel by car. Increased use of public transport can reduce obesity \u2013 as well as  making people happier . How long-lasting the COVID-19 impact on emissions is depends on how much we want some of the temporary changes to continue. For example, COVID-19 showed more people walk and cycle if there are fewer cars, which supports evidence that safety is a big barrier to cycling and we need dedicated cycle ways to  keep people away from traffic . We also know people are happy with a little inconvenience to have safer  play-friendly streets . Encouraging some of the lockdown behavioural changes could have additional benefits and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. \u00a0 Simon Kingham is a Geography Professor at the University of Canterbury.\u00a0 Simon Kingham does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. \n \u00a0 This article is republished from  The Conversation  under a Creative Commons license.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the report highlights the \"urgency\" facing the world. \"It brings together data from across the fields of climate science and lists the potential future impacts of climate change \u2013 from health and economic consequences to decreased food security and increased displacement,\" he said. \"We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for. \"Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue.

A study of attitudes over a 10-year period shows older New Zealanders are becoming increasingly aware of the risks of climate change. Thousands of school students took to the streets in 2019 protesting a lack of climate change action. And the protestors weren't all young. \"I'm very embarrassed about where my generation has got the world today,\" one person said. The increase in older activists is inspiring new research on generational attitudes about climate change. Using a decade of data from the Attitudes and Values Survey, a new study has found older Kiwis are just as concerned about climate change as the younger generation. \"Across all age groups there is a comparable increase, the same rate of increase,\" says Dr Taciano Milfont, the lead author of the University of Waikato study. \"Older people are also concerned.\" Older people like Caz Sheldon. \"If not me then who, who is going to do it? That definitely is the driver,\" she says. The 70-year-old was part of the 2019 Extinction Rebellion protest in Wellington that shut down main roads and closed the ANZ bank. \"We don't know how much longer we've got and we want to leave the place better than it is now.\" Wellingtonians we spoke to still think it's the younger generation driving change.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says she wouldn't compare to climate change to World War II - a comparison her Associate Transport Minister, Julie Anne Genter, made last week. On Twitter last week, Genter declared climate change was \"our generation's WWII\" while discussing the Government's  proposed 'feebate' scheme  which would provide discounts on some low-emission, electric and fuel-efficient petrol-run vehicles. However, on the flipside, vehicles which emit more than 250 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre (CO2/km) would be considered heavy polluters so importing those vehicles would come with a financial penalty of up to $3000. That's angered farmers and tradies who say they need larger vehicles for their jobs. Glen Burr, president of New Zealand Plumbers, Drainlayers and Gasfitters - who drives a Holden Colorado ute - told Newshub he would be forced to pass the tax onto his customers. Genter says she has spoken with the imported vehicle industry and heard their concerns. She said she also shared some of her own. \"The climate crisis is the biggest challenge of our time. It's our generation's WWII. We are the first generation to feel its impacts,\" Genter tweeted. \"New Zealand was too small to win WWII. But that didn't stop many of our forebears from putting their hands up. They put their lives on hold, and travelled far away, to be part of a larger effort, because it was the right thing to do. \"This is how we play our part, little New Zealand, in the most important global challenge of our time. Everyone pitching in and doing what they can.\" Some Twitter users agreed with Genter's comparison, with one user saying: \"Climate change and WW2 are very similar. Massive threats to our way of life that requires concerted and substantial action to overcome, including sacrificing lifestyle.\" But others weren't convinced. One person wrote: \"Not a very well thought out metaphor and bugger-all to do with this current situation and alarmism doesn't help with clarity of thought.\" While Ardern has previously compared climate change to her generation's \"nuclear-free moment\", she wouldn't compare it to WWII - a conflict in which 12,000 New Zealanders died. \"In terms of the big challenges our current generation is battling, climate change is our greatest security challenge of our time,\" Ardern told The AM Show. \"I wouldn't liken it in terms of human loss.\" But she also wouldn't criticise Genter, saying she wasn't aware of the context in which Genter made that statement and individuals could characterise the challenge of climate change as they pleased. \"She needs to choose her own way of talking about that challenge we face. I wouldn't make that comparison but I am not critiquing her for that.\" While popular utes like the Ford Ranger and Toyota Hilux would become more expensive to import to New Zealand, Ardern said it was an important incentive.\u00a0 \"We need to incentivise people to start making the choices where it is not just about EVs, it's about low emission vehicles generally. There are options that we do need to start trying to prioritise. \"People pay more at the pump by not buying these more fuel efficient cars as well. People will save money in the long run.\" National's Associate Transport spokesperson Brett Hudson said hiking the cost of certain vehicles will impose more costs on some families who can't afford to switch to an electric vehicle. Deputy leader Paula Bennett echoed Hudson, telling The AM Show: \"Don't mess with my tradies and their utes, man, and don't mess with our farmers - they're out there doing a damn good job.\" National MP Judith Collins criticised Genter on Friday, saying she should stay away from issues \"she is not intimately involved in\".\u00a0 Genter told Newshub  her grandfather fought in Italy and Africa during World War II. \"WWII was a moment in history where nations big and small fought alongside each other to defend their share values and common humanity. \"Climate change also requires us to look beyond our borders to our common humanity, and do our bit to solve a problem that affects all of us, however big or small we may be.\" The Government is taking numerous measures to combat climate change,  introducing a Zero Carbon Bill  into Parliament in May which would create a legally binding objective to limit global warming to now more than 1.5C with a net zero carbon approach.

What's worse, only half of us believe our actions will be effective.\u00a0 Despite the negative news, there is room to be optimistic. The good news from the latest IAG-IPSOS poll, which surveyed 1,000 Kiwis, is that 79 percent of us believe that climate change is important. That's up 7 percent from last year. The poll also showed that 69 percent are more concerned than they've ever been before, while 67 percent of Kiwis are prepared to act to reduce the impacts of climate change. \n The problem is only 54 percent of people said they know what to do, while only 47 percent of respondents think their actions will actually be effective. The Archer family says that making a change is not as complicated as many think. The Auckland family of six produce just one council-sized bin of rubbish per year. In five years, the Archers have slashed the amount of waste they produce, and in the process saved thousands of dollars.\u00a0 From composting to backyard chickens and their impressive vegetable patch, the family bring less into their home and consequently throw out less.\u00a0 But while it all looks daunting on the outside, they encourage people to start small.\u00a0 \"People try and go all at once and immediately switch from a heavy-waste household to zero-waste overnight - it's just such a daunting transition,\" says Stephen Archer. \"It's better to go slower.\" Archer says everyone needs to take personal responsibility for their rubbish. \"Don't underestimate what impact you can actually have,\" he says. Nic Taylor started her business Mainstream based on that philosophy.\u00a0 \"We might feel like we're one person doing one small thing, but the reality is by doing that and by role-modeling that we're inspiring other people to do the same, and that's how change scales,\" she says. Taylor consults with individuals, councils and businesses on how to go green. \"The shift in the past 12 to 18 months has been phenomenal, just in terms of the interest and the engagement and the awareness. So I'm very hopeful.\" One example of that is the protest earlier this year that brought out thousands of students to advocate for more to be done against climate change.\u00a0 \"It couldn't be a more urgent problem and we really have to do everything we can as individuals and as a country,\" says climate scientist Professor James Renwick.

Not a huge amount when it comes to the science, says  Stuff climate change editor Eloise Gibson ... but quite a lot when it comes to the messaging . This report is less specialised, less dense, Gibson says, and appears to have among its aims influencing governments through people power.\u00a0 The more 'normal people' understand about what's happening, the easier it is for citizens themselves to hold their own governments to account. On today's episode, Emile Donovan sits down with Gibson to discuss the good, bad, and ugly headlines from the IPCC's sixth assessment report. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was formed in 1988. It released its first report in 1990. And in the interceding 31 years, the science has remained largely the same, says Gibson. \"The fundamental message hasn't changed that much. Certainly it's gotten stronger, more solid, more widely accepted, but there's nothing in the latest report that researchers didn't know 30 years ago. \"Had we started in earnest on this transition 30 years ago, we would have a lot of these things cracked by now. We're certainly capable of doing it.\" While the big picture hasn't changed too much, the language used to communicate its ideas has.\u00a0 \"The first takeaway of the report is: the effects of climate change are here ... and they're here now, it's not something that a model on a computer is telling us is going to happen in 100 years' time. \"The second was that it's now inarguable, incontrovertible, that these changes are being caused by us - and the signal of that, versus the noise of natural variability, is now very clear as well. \"The third takeaway is that some of these impacts are now baked in. Seas are going to keep rising for centuries or millennia now, because of temperature changes that we've already produced. We can't do anything about that. And the atmosphere is going to keep warming for 20 or 30 years now, in even the best-case scenario. \"But the final takeaway is that it's not too late to put the brakes on, and stop it getting worse.\"\u00a0 The IPCC's most recent assessment report before this came out eight years ago and was criticised for its inaccessibility and dense language: scientists writing for other scientists. However, Gibson says that's very different this year.\u00a0 The summary of the report - the wording of which has to be agreed on by all the governments involved with the IPCC, which is a politically delicate, weeks-long process as representatives veto and sanitise certain words and phrasing - is much more accessible. Gibson suggests this may be a deliberate act on the part of the IPCC to encourage people to engage with and understand the ideas in the report, and force their own governments to act.\u00a0 \"This is something that affects all of us ... we should be able to understand it, we should be able to read it.\" RNZ", "headline": "How much climate catastrophe can one world absorb?", "article_name": "how-much-climate-catastrophe-can-one-world-absorb", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/08/how-much-climate-catastrophe-can-one-world-absorb.html", "date_published": "2021-08-13 07:25:29", "article_length": 3132, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:29.651309"}

{"id": null, "body": "An in-depth report by the Royal Society of New Zealand has outlined the effect continuing climate change will have on New Zealand, and the result is likely to be devastating. It found six key areas New Zealand was particularly vulnerable to: Unless serious action is taken to remove global emissions of greenhouse gases, it's almost certain climate change will accelerate over the century. As an ocean-bound nation with a large proportion of the population living in coastal or flood-prone areas, New Zealand is very vulnerable to the projected changes, says Professor James Renwick. Prof Renwick is the chair of the expert panel who wrote the reports and he says even little alterations in averages can have a huge difference in how often extreme events occur. \"With a 30cm rise in sea level, the current 'one in 100 years' extreme sea event would be expected to occur once every year or so in many coastal regions. Along the Otago coast for example, the difference between a two-year and 100-year storm surge is about 32cm of sea level.\" Rainfall and heatwaves are likely to be affected in the same way -- if carbon dioxide levels continue to rise, a number of regions will see double to quadruple the number of days per year above 25degC by 2100. Across the northeast South Island and the north and eastern North Island, annual rainfall is expected to decrease, but increase in some other regions. It's predicted fire risk across many parts of the country will rise, and the frequency of droughts in eastern and northern New Zealand is expected to double or triple by 2040. Combined with urban expansion, competition for freshwater is going to get heated, the report says. Ocean levels are forecast to rise in a future with high carbon emissions, threatening coastal populations and eroding land. The report also found evidence of acidification in waters surrounding New Zealand, which can damage the exoskeleton of many marine organisms such as paua and mussels. \"International research suggests that fish may also be affected by ocean acidification, and new work is underway to characterise impacts on fish in the New Zealand region,\" the report says. As ocean levels rise and rainfall increases, both rural and urban flood-prone areas, including those near the coast, are expected to suffer. \"Flooding is the most frequent natural disaster in New Zealand and the second-most costly one after earthquakes,\" the report says, placing around two-thirds of Kiwis as living in areas prone to flooding. But while things look bad for the humans, it's even worse for our unique ecosystem. More than half of New Zealand's 50,000 species can't be found anywhere else in the world. \"New Zealand's native plants and animals already face pressure from habitat loss and fragmentation, introduced mammalian predators and herbivores and invasive plants,\" the report says. \"Climate change will increase the stress on many of these already stressed systems.\" Part of the problem with Government and societal responses to climate change is the fact it's still so unsure -- it's known heavy rainfall will become more frequent, the average sea level will rise and droughts will increase in intensity and frequency, but to what extent is uncertain. The uncertainties hold groups and individuals from making decisions. But the report compares the risks of climate change to preparing in case of a house fire. \"Having your house burn down is not likely, but the consequences would be devastating. So, we are proactive and fit smoke alarms and take out house insurance, just in case. \"Taking action on the basis of climate change risk helps ensure that New Zealand\u2019s society and environment can be resilient by responding flexibly to changing climatic as well as social, economic and environmental conditions.\" It also highlights the frailty of Antarctica's ice, warning a melt could contribute to several metres of global sea level rise. \"The exact amount of warming required to trigger irreversible melting is unknown, but may be as little as one more degree.\" The report predicts dangers to come based on climate change in the coming years, but the Green Party says we're already seeing it. Last year's floods in Whanganui were a prime example, party co-leader James Shaw says. \"Victoria University did a study on that, but found that drought was as long and as deep as it was because of climate change. So we've already had droughts, but the thing is they're getting more frequent, longer and deeper.\" It's proof damage from climate change is coming whether we like it or not, he says, and the evidence is overwhelming. \"This is going to take place gradually over the course of the coming decade and a half, so we really need to get ahead of this and start planning for it. \"It's time for us to get together and develop a plan that actually reduces New Zealand's contribution to global warming.\" Newshub.", "headline": "NZ to be devastated by continuing climate change", "article_name": "nz-to-be-devastated-by-continuing-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2016/05/nz-to-be-devastated-by-continuing-climate-change.html", "date_published": "2016-04-19 05:00:00", "article_length": 4888, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:30.001139"}

It confirms that sea level rise is accelerating thanks to humanity's increasing greenhouse gas emissions, but that's not all. \"What this report tells us is the oceans are getting warmer, they're losing oxygen, they're getting more acidic,\" Greenpeace oceans campaigner Jessica Desmond told The AM Show. \"We're seeing sea level rise, and we're seeing coastal wetlands, reefs and natural protections from extreme weather events breaking down all around us.\" According to scientists, as the ocean warms its layers of water don't mix - warm water rises - which reduces the flow of oxygen and nutrients for marine life.\u00a0 The cryosphere encompasses parts of the world typically covered in ice.\u00a0 \"We can now say with some confidence that Arctic sea-ice decline is unprecedented in at least 1000 years, which is some of the clearest evidence yet that human impacts on climate already dominate over anything natural,\" said Prof Steven Sherwood of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre. \"Also, this report examines expected changes out to the year 2300, when sea level rise is projected to be three to four metres without mitigation efforts, but could be kept under one metre with strong mitigation efforts.\" The ocean plays an important in protecting us against temperatures getting even higher than they already are. \"The IPCC SROCC report confirms that the oceans provide us with an amazing buffer against climate change,\" said University of Otago and NIWA expert Prof Cliff Law, who contributed to the report as a reviewer. \"By absorbing 20 to 30 percent of the [carbon dioxide] we've released and an incredible 90 percent-plus of the additional heat retained in the global climate system, it's prevented the planet overheating.\" But warm water takes up more room than cold, so as the ocean warms it expands - add melting ice on top of this, and there are fears much of the damage has been done, regardless of what actions we take. \"The best available computer models suggest the threshold for large, irreversible change is nearby - somewhere between 1.5C and 2C global mean warming,\" said University of Otago's Prof Christina Hulbe. \"So while there is certainly change locked in, it may still be possible to avoid some of the largest consequences of global warming.\" Temperatures are now about 1C warmer than in pre-industrial times. The report -which had more than 100 contributors from 36 countries - says since 1993, the rate of warming in the ocean has doubled. The seas rose 15cm in the 20th century, but now - less than two decades later - they're already rising twice as fast.\u00a0\u00a0 \"There is some change that is locked in, but what it tells us is that if we act now, we can drastically reduce the impacts that we're going to see over time,\" added Desmond.\u00a0 \"We need to put 30 percent of the ocean off-limits to human activity. We've done a model of what that might look like, but most of the ocean is international waters - so we can put large swathes of international waters off-limits to exploitative activities, like fishing and seabed mining.\" She said currently less than 1 percent of international waters are off-limits.\u00a0 IPCC Working Group II co-chair Debra Roberts says preventing the worst of climate change will take \"unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society, including energy, land and ecosystems, urban and infrastructure as well as industry\". \"The ambitious climate policies and emissions reductions required to deliver the Paris Agreement will also protect the ocean and cryosphere - and ultimately sustain all life on Earth. The more decisively and the earlier we act, the more able we will be to address unavoidable changes, manage risks, improve our lives and achieve sustainability for ecosystems and people around the world - today and in the future.\" Desmond says even our Government, for all its talk, isn't doing enough.\u00a0 \"They've done some good things... but there has to be much more action. It's not enough. We've known for a long time about climate change and successive Governments have let us down. But they know what the solutions are.\" Newshub. \u00a0", "headline": "How we're killing the oceans detailed in devastating new climate report", "article_name": "how-we-re-killing-the-oceans-detailed-in-devastating-new-climate-report", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2019/09/how-we-re-killing-the-oceans-detailed-in-devastating-new-climate-report.html", "date_published": "2019-09-26 08:29:33", "article_length": 4517, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:30.171211"}

Credits: Image - Getty; Video - Reuters  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is calling for other countries to follow New Zealand's lead on climate change.\u00a0\u00a0 \n On Friday morning, Ardern joined US President Joe Biden and 38 other global leaders at a virtual Leaders Summit on Climate. Biden committed the US to cutting carbon emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

The world beyond 1.5C degrees means more frequent and intense fires, floods, droughts, heatwaves and hurricanes - tearing through communities, ripping away lives and livelihoods.\"\u00a0 While New Zealand didn't commit to any new targets, Ardern used the summit to highlight the work already underway.\u00a0 As part of the Paris Agreement New Zealand previously pledged to slash emissions by 30 percent below 2005 levels and 11 percent below 1990 levels, by 2030.\u00a0 Under the Zero Carbon Act, New Zealand is also committed to bringing down carbon dioxide to net zero by 2050, with a separate aim of reducing methane levels - mainly attributed to agriculture - by somewhere between 24 to 47 percent.\u00a0 The Prime Minister used the summit to call on other countries to follow New Zealand's lead. \"New Zealand welcomes the United States' international leadership on climate change and sees this summit as an important opportunity to work collectively to drive effective global action on climate change,\" Ardern said.\u00a0 \"We used the Summit to call on others to follow New Zealand's lead and do the following four things: price carbon, make climate-related financial disclosures mandatory, end fossil fuel subsidies, and finance adaptation. Now it's time for us all to act.\"\u00a0 New Zealand will begin pricing agricultural emissions from 2025 and in 2020 was the first country to announce mandatory climate-related financial disclosures. The country has also been pricing carbon since 2008.\u00a0 Ardern also used the summit to highlight the impact of climate change on the Pacific.\u00a0 \"Our Pacific neighbours have identified climate change as the single biggest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific. Our collective goal, here at this summit and beyond, has to be making commitments to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.\" Canada, Japan and South Korea all committed to new emission targets at the summit.\u00a0 Canada promised to limit carbon emissions by 40-45 percent by 2030, however this target was criticised by campaigners for not going far enough. Japan pledged to reduce emissions by 46 percent by 2030 compared to 2013 levels. South Korea committed to a new target and said it would stop financing the building of coal-fired power stations overseas.\u00a0 But India and China, two of the world's biggest emitters, made no new commitments.

{"id": null, "body": "In  part one  and  two  of our special investigation into the health of New Zealand's rivers, Newshub examined what exactly is polluting our waterways, and what is being done to try to protect and save them. In part three we look at what effects climate change could have on the health of our rivers, and analyse if we've already reached the tipping point for overall decline in waterway health. One of the biggest problems facing our rivers, especially those in areas of New Zealand facing drought such as the Canterbury plains, or a noticeable rise in temperature such as Waikato and Northland, is keeping the water flow cool. As we examined in part two of Newshub's report , Kiwi dairy farmers are undertaking a massive planting operation alongside the area of land immediately adjacent to waterways on their farms, known as the riparian area - and one of the many reasons these plants are important is because they help shade the water, keeping them cool. NIWA has worked with the dairy industry on best practice to protect rivers from getting warmer, and chief scientist of freshwater and estuaries Dr John Quinn says riparian planting is a key weapon in fighting to keep our rivers from heating up. \"If we get riparian shade around small streams now it's one thing we can do to mitigate some of that impact by reducing the heating that's going to occur.\u00a0 \"But that's just the reality that if we carry on the way we are with climate change we're going to see less water in those areas that will have big impacts in both the agricultural system and on the stream system, it certainly exacerbates the problems we have with purification in both lakes and in rivers.\" NIWA has predicted what river flow in New Zealand could look like by the end of this century, using data from current climate change projections. \n As you can see, rivers on the east coast of the South Island, Wairarapa, Hawke's Bay, Waikato, Auckland and Northland all face the possibility of having a 5 - 10 percent reduction in river flow by 2090. Alpine rivers however, especially those in the Southern Alps of the South Island, are projected to have a drastic increase in flow. On the projection, NIWA says: \"In a warmer world New Zealand is exposed to more westerly airflow from the Tasman, and few easterlies. This would bring more precipitation to the Southern Alps in particular, resulting in higher river flows in rivers with alpine sources. This is seen quite vividly as Canterbury's major rivers become wetter on average while their shorter nearby rivers tend to dry. The largest decline, in percentage terms, centres on parts of Hawke's Bay.\" NIWA say there is a 20 - 100 percent projection of decreased river flow in some areas of Hawke's Bay and Banks Peninsula in Canterbury. There are obviously thousands of agriculture businesses in those areas expected to see a reduction in river flow - not just dairy farming, but beef, lamb and a myriad of other land based industries. Warmer temperatures will kill off vital insect populations DairyNZ water scientist Dr Tom Stephens told Newshub he believes one of the biggest threats to our waterways is rising temperatures. \"The biggest way of removing oxygen from our waterways is simply by heating them up. And if you raise the water temperature of a waterway on top of removing the oxygen carrying capacity, it actually directly impacts on our high value insect species, the stonefly and the mayfly. \"If a stream rises above 20 degrees, those species will disappear. They undergo mortality, what we call extinction, and yet those species are critical sources of food for our fish, and they're also critical to grazing algae and keeping that under control.\" The larger the waterway - the harder it is to cool NIWA's Dr John Quinn says that while riparian planting can help protect smaller streams from heating up, the problem becomes more complicated the larger the waterway gets. \"So clearly, if you can shade out the stream you reduce the temperature which is one of the things that is making algal blooms grow more quickly, and the light which makes them grow. \"We've done experiments on different scales that show that that really does work, but once streams get bigger - beyond 10 to 15 metres - it becomes more and more challenging to shade, to use shade to control.\" Dr Stephens agrees that protecting these larger waterways from the heat of the sun is incredibly important. New Zealand's longest river, the Waikato, is also one our widest, and in certain areas has seen a stark decline in health. He puts this down to insect populations, which are incredibly important to river health. \"One of the biggest reasons why we don't have the insect diversity we need and we want in our community in the Waikato waterways is that they're too hot. \"Algal growth can be important to insect health, particularly in shallow streams, when we're talking about a deep river or a hydro lake it's slightly different, because the algal growth isn't attached to the bed, it's the free floating stuff, it's what we call phytoplankton.\u00a0 \"Because you can't shade the lake, or a river that's larger than five metres wide, you just can't get enough shade on it to control for that algae. \" So climate change looks set to have a drastic impact on the health of our waterways, and it would appear science can only do so much to protect them. Discussions need to be happening now about how best to tackle this problem before it spirals beyond control and the rivers on the Canterbury Plains and Hawke's Bay dry up for good. The Selwyn River in Canterbury looks to have almost dried up already  - and a major investigation needs to be done to find out why. If too much water has been taken out of the Selwyn to irrigate agricultural-based industries, which has been suggested, then surely the Government must get involved to stop this from happening to other rivers. So have we reached a tipping point for overall river decline in New Zealand? Dr Mike Joy teaches environmental sustainability at Massey University and says the shocking state of the Selwyn River in particular should be a wake-up call for all New Zealanders. \"There's certainly some basket cases like the Selwyn. It's a bad example of just decades of putting the wrong things in the wrong place and now, it's coming home to haunt us.\u00a0 \"If you take the whole country then nearly all of our rivers are in perfect condition where they start off, in a conservation state they're fantastic pristine rivers as good as anywhere in the world, but it's the bottom ends that are the problem.\" It could take generations for our rivers to recover Dr Kevin Simon teaches freshwater ecology at Auckland University. He believes we've not reached the tipping point yet, but we are very close. \"Could it be saved? Sure. It certainly could be made better. It will take a long time and a very large amount of effort. \"So I think that one of the big questions is how much effort are we going to require to repair some of these systems to make them better and how long should we be thinking about in terms of timeframe for recovery.\u00a0 \"It could be very well in order of talking about decades or generations.\" Is 'polluter pays' part of the answer? Dr Joy shares Dr Simon's views but is perhaps less optimistic of a positive outcome for our rivers. \"The majority of our rivers are in decline, they're getting worse, they're not even stable. \"They're all of the rivers that are in pastoral catchment, nearly all of them are getting worse and so there's no sign, we're doing nothing that's going to reduce it unless we get some kind of a handle on reducing intensification and we have to do something about polluter pays. \"So until we do that, until we actually start making some change and not just talking about it then we're just going to have continuing decline of our water quality. \"We have to face up to the fact that we've made a mess and actually do something about it.\" Dr Stephens paints a far more positive picture. \"I wouldn't say that the rivers are getting worse as such. If you look at the latest trend reporting by NIWA and the Waikato Regional Council, indicators for sediment are improving, indicators for phosphorus are improving, indicators for algae in our hydro lakes are improving.\u00a0 \"There isn't a hydro lake where the algal growth is worsening, not in the last 10 to 20 years.\" Tomorrow, in part four of Newshub's special investigation into the health of New Zealand's waterways, we'll examine the blame game and finger-pointing that has ramped up over the decline of our river health - and ask whether it is time for all parties, organisations and industries to have a frank and urgent discussion about how they can best work together to save them.

Instead it's been replaced by a struggle to find talented staff in the wake of worldwide restrictions on travel thanks to COVID-19, and a reliance on technology like never before.\u00a0 \"This latest pulse check really does show the challenges that have emerged through COVID, and also some interesting comparisons about what New Zealand CEOs are facing compared to their global cohort,\" KPMG executive chairman-elect Matt Pritchard told Newshub. KPMG surveys chief executives here and overseas a couple of times a year to get a handle on how they're going and what they see as the biggest challenges to business.\u00a0 Five key themes emerged this year, he said. Firstly, chief executives have \"become more purpose-driven in the face of COVID-19 and the associated economic crisis... nearly 80 percent of global and New Zealand CEOs surveyed, feel a stronger emotional connection to their organisation's purpose since the crisis began.\" Secondly, with the walls put up around the world to prevent the spread of the virus, bosses are now having to look locally for new talent. \"CEOs rely on top talent to execute change, and what we're seeing and hearing from CEOs in the face of the current crisis is they're making decisions in days that previously would have taken months, and they're executing change in a matter of weeks that previously would have taken years,\" said Pritchard. Those skills aren't always held by existing staff, he said, and there's no longer a global pool of talent to choose from. \"Borders are shut and the global market for talent isn't as open as it used to be.\" Thirdly, half of the chief executives surveyed said their firms are now far more digitised than they expected to be at this stage, \"which you might expect with the limitations of COVID-19 on physical operations\". \"Since February, digital sales channels have near doubled, marketing spend has shifted from traditional media to online and social channels, and all this change has led to increased customer expectations for their online experience,\" said Dinesh Naik, KPMG head of retail. This growing reliance on technology has made cyber risk CEOs' number one threat to growth, according to the survey. Fourth, in January 30 percent of CEOs said climate change was the biggest threat to their business growth - now it's only 14 percent. Pritchard said that was surprising. Lastly, supply chain issues are ranked second in Australia and globally in terms of threats to growth, but only 11th in New Zealand - this too surprised Pritchard. \"We're an exporting nation and highly dependent on some quite complex supply chains. But when we went in behind the data... by July, when we were surveying CEOs in New Zealand, the most significant period of domestic operational disruption caused by the COVID-19 lockdown was over.\" Slightly more than two-thirds of CEOs said they had to rethink their supply chain approach due to the pandemic.\u00a0 New Zealand's economy held up better than most other countries' after appearing to have eliminated the virus earlier this year.

Credits: Newshub By Russell Palmer for RNZ Green Party co-leader James Shaw is defending against accusations of hypocrisy for travelling to a climate conference in Glasgow after criticising Parliament's sitting at alert level 4. The Green Party refused to attend Parliament while Wellington was still at alert level 4 on Tuesday last week. Shaw at the time had said there was a perfectly serviceable option that would enable MPs to work from home - Parliament via teleconferencing software Zoom - and politicians should be modelling the health advice to stay home. He said the party was reluctant to be returning to the House even at alert level 3. \"I think it's absolutely irresponsible, I mean it literally risks people's lives by holding an in-person Parliament,\" Shaw said.

In a statement today, ACT leader David Seymour said Shaw's hypocrisy was breathtaking. \"Shaw is on the record saying many people, such as teachers, have adapted to working over Zoom. It seems that Shaw's regard for international conferences, this one being the 26th of its kind held, is higher than his regard for New Zealand's Parliament,\" Seymour said.

There isn't a virtual option for COP. Exactly as he did with the return to Parliament, the Minister will follow all the health advice, including returning to New Zealand through MIQ,\" the spokesperson said. \"Those nations most impacted by the climate emergency have urged countries to come together at COP to agree a major and urgent increase in action, as well as to accelerate funding to support mitigation and adaptation in the most vulnerable countries. \"Minister Shaw is attending so NZ can play its part fully in bringing about this outcome.

The country's biggest greenhouse gas emitter - the agriculture industry - has been offered an escape route in a climate change discussion document released today. The Government has laid out three possible targets to reduce emissions, one of which sets softer targets for methane emitted by animals, while cutting carbon dioxide from other sectors to zero. A jubilant James Shaw outlined his ambitious plans for New Zealand on Thursday, confidently saying the country would \"make climate change history\". The Climate Change Minister has given the public three targets to consider - but one has no goal for reducing methane, our biggest source of climate pollution. Greenpeace is stunned, calling it \"a cop-out\". All three pathways outline a \"net-zero\" target, meaning the amount you pollute must be offset by, for example, planting trees. The first option to reduce emissions by 2050 is to be net-zero in carbon dioxide - there's no mention of methane at all. The second is to be net-zero in all emissions. The third is to be net-zero in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and to stabilise methane. Kate Simcock, Greenpeace's climate campaigner, says methane reduction needs to be a priority. \"Methane's a shorter lived gas, but it's also our most potent and in New Zealand it's our biggest source of climate emissions, so we really need to work out how to tackle it.\" But farmers say because methane doesn't linger in the atmosphere as long as the carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide spewed out by cars, it's less of a problem. The minister says he doesn't have a preference for which target is adopted, and wanted to give the public options to choose from.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images By Belinda van Heerwaarden and Ary Hoffmann for The Conversation Evidence of  declining fertility  in humans and wildlife is growing. While chemicals in our environment have been identified as a major cause, our  new research  shows there's another looming threat to animal fertility: climate change. We know animals can die when temperatures rise to extremes they cannot endure. However, our research suggests males of some species can become infertile even at less extreme temperatures. This means the distribution of species may be limited by the temperatures at which they can reproduce, rather than the temperatures at which they can survive. These findings are important, because they mean we may be underestimating the impacts of climate change on animals - and failing to identify the species most likely to become extinct. Researchers have known for some time that animal fertility is sensitive to heat stress. For example, research shows a 2C temperature rise dramatically reduces the production of sperm bundles and egg size  in corals . And in many  beetle  and  bee  species, fertilisation success drops sharply at high temperatures. High temperatures have also been shown to affect fertilisation or sperm count in  cows ,  pigs ,  fish  and  birds . However, temperatures that cause infertility have not been incorporated into predictions about how climate change will affect biodiversity. Our research aims to address this. The paper  published today  involved researchers from the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia, including one author of this article. The study examined 43 species of fly to test whether male fertility temperatures were a better predictor of global fly distributions than the temperatures at which the adult fly dies - also known as their \"survival limit\". The researchers exposed flies to four hours of heat stress at temperatures ranging from benign to lethal. From this data they estimated both the temperature that is lethal to 80 percent of individuals and the temperature at which 80 percent of surviving males become infertile. They found 11 of 43 species experienced an 80 percent loss in fertility at cooler-than-lethal temperatures immediately following heat stress. Rather than fertility recovering over time, the impact of high temperatures was more pronounced seven days after exposure to heat stress. Using this delayed measure, 44 percent of species (19 out of 43) showed fertility loss at cooler-than-lethal temperatures. The researchers then matched these findings to real-world data on the flies' distribution, and estimated the average maximum air temperatures the species are likely to encounter in the wild. They found the distribution of fly species is linked more closely to the effects of high temperature on male fertility than on temperatures that kill flies. These fertility responses are crucial to species survival. A separate study led by one author of this article, using simulated climate change in the laboratory,  showed  experimental populations of the same flies become extinct not because they can't survive the heat, but because the males become infertile. Species from tropical rainforests were the first to succumb to extinction. The prediction that tropical and sub-tropical species may be more vulnerable to climate change is  not new . But the fertility findings suggest the negative impact of climate change may be even worse than anticipated. Some animals have adapted to minimise the effect of high temperature on fertility. For instance, it's thought testes in  male primates  and humans are externally located to protect the developing sperm from excessive heat. As the planet warms, animals may further evolve to withstand the effects of heat on fertility. But the speed at which a species can adapt may be too slow to ensure their survival. Our research has shown both tropical and widespread species of flies  could not  increase their fertility when exposed to simulated global warming, even after 25 generations. A study involving beetles  also indicates  fertility damage from successive heatwaves can accumulate over time. And more work is needed to determine how other stressors such as salinity, chemicals and poor nutrition may compound the fertility-temperature problem. Whether our findings extrapolate to other species, including mammals such as humans, is not yet clear. It's certainly possible, given evidence across the animal kingdom that fertility is sensitive to heat stress. Either way, unless global warming is radically curbed, animal fertility will likely decline. This means Earth may be heading for far more species extinctions than previously anticipated.

The Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Bill will create a legally binding objective to limit global warming to no more than 1.5degC with a net zero carbon approach. A specific target for biogenic methane has also been created with Climate Change Minister James Shaw saying the Government needed to work with the agriculture industry to manage emissions. The bill sets out a 10 percent reduction in biological methane emissions by 2030, with a provisional reduction ranging from 24 percent to 47 percent the aim by 2050. However Federated Farmers said the targets would send the message to farmers that New Zealand is prepared to give up on pastoral farming. \"This decision is frustratingly cruel, because there is nothing I can do on my farm today that will give me confidence I can ever achieve these targets,\" said vice president and Climate Change spokesperson Andrew Hoggard. He said New Zealand farmers are already playing their part in tackling global warming, and are willing to do more. \"But hearing the Government setting arbitrary targets based on a random selection of reports and incomplete data will leave some farmers wondering; 'what is the point?'\" he said. \"The 10 percent reduction target for methane by 2030 gives us a deadline for going beyond net zero more than 20 years earlier than for any other sector of New Zealand. It is unheard of anywhere else on the planet.\" He said the targets are significantly higher than what is necessary to be equivalent to net-zero carbon dioxide. \"The announced methane reduction target for 2050 of 24-50 percent, when coupled with the target of net zero for nitrous oxide, requires the New Zealand agriculture sector to reduce its emissions by 43-60 percent.\" \"Let's be clear, the only way to achieve reductions of that level, is to cut production. There are no magic technologies out there waiting for us to implement.\" \"At this point in time we have no idea how to achieve reductions of this level, without culling significant stock numbers.\" Meanwhile New Zealand's meat processors and exporters are also alarmed at the proposed methane emissions reduction target. Chief executive of the Meat Industry Association (MIA) Tim Ritchie said the Government appears to have based its target on a range of global emissions scenarios in the IPCC report. \"We are concerned the Government has cherrypicked aspects of a report summarising global emission pathway scenarios and applied it to New Zealand,\" he said. \"Their target is contrary to science-based policy. The science indicates that to achieve a goal of no increased global warming from agriculture, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture must come down to net zero as quickly as possible, but methane only requires a slow decline in the order of 0.3 percent a year.\" He said the proposed emissions targets are simply not possible with current technologies and farming methods, short of a significant decrease in pastoral agriculture. \"This will impose enormous economic costs on the country and threaten many regional communities who depend on pastoral agriculture.\" Newshub. \u00a0", "headline": " 'Frustratingly cruel': Farmer fury grows over Government's climate change plans", "article_name": "frustratingly-cruel-farmer-fury-grows-over-government-s-climate-change-plans", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/rural/2019/05/frustratingly-cruel-farmer-fury-grows-over-government-s-climate-change-plans.html", "date_published": "2019-05-08 13:17:33", "article_length": 3378, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:31.884310"}

From Craighead Diocesan School in Timaru to James Cook High School in Auckland, over 4,000 kids took part in New Zealand\u2019s Climate Change Day of Action on Thursday September 22, which coincided with World Car Free Day. Masterton Primary School succeeded in organising a walking school bus, filling up their bike racks and almost emptying their car park, all in efforts to reduce carbon emissions.  Year 9 students from James Cook High School raised awareness by making presentations about the importance of combating the reality of climate change to their school.\u00a0The school managed to decrease the number who drove to school by almost 40 percent, something the students hope will continue. James Cook High School, along with other schools, was inspired by a UNICEF Pacific video on young people making an influence. \u00a0A student from Kiribati, Iaoniman Kambati, explained how the drinking water from their wells had become salty because of rising sea levels. \u201cAs young people who will be leaders of tomorrow, we\u2019re not just sitting around doing nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do something about this issue.\u201d  Iaoniman and other students from the islands are challenging the global community to stop negotiating and actually do something about the issue, because the effects of climate change are threatening their homes and futures.  At Havelock North High School, many teachers played their part by biking to school.\u00a0 English teacher Simon Murfitt said everyone can make a difference, and one of the most effective ways is how we travel to school every day. \u201cWe can dramatically reduce our carbon emissions through this simple act, whilst being able to keep active at the same time,\u201d he said.  Instead of being driven to school every day, students promoted walking, cycling, taking the bus and even car-pooling.  A \u2018wear blue to support UNICEF\u2019 mufti day was organised to raise funds to provide water pumps for climate affected communities.  The day of action supported Moving Planet, a global event where over 175 countries rallied to put the world\u2019s demands for climate action into motion \u2013 by calling for the world to go beyond fossil fuels.

{"id": null, "body": "Watch Climate Change Minister James Shaw's press conference.   Credits: Image - Getty; Video - Newshub With a few exceptions, New Zealand is \"not making any transformative change to meet the world's targets\", warns climate change lecturer Dr Alex Lo. His comments came after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s sixth report, which has warned that without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5C is beyond reach. The IPCC had already warned in previous reports that if Earth warms by 2C, hundreds of thousands of species could go extinct, various natural environments would die and many coastal communities will be flooded out of existence. The good news is that despite average annual global greenhouse gas emissions reaching their highest levels in human history from 2010 to 2019, the rate of growth has slowed. The United States, the UK, Sweden, Romania, France, Ireland, Spain, Bulgaria, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Finland and Croatia  have all seen their emissions decrease . But not New Zealand. Stats NZ's environmental indicators update in February  found that emissions in 2019 showed no sustained reductions compared to 2005 levels, and that our glacier ice volumes are continuing to decrease. Greenhouse gas emissions were mainly made up of carbon dioxide (45.5 percent), methane produced by livestock from their digestive system (42.1 percent) and nitrous oxide from nitrogen-based fertilisers (10.2 percent). \"New Zealand has done quite poorly in controlling transport emissions, in particular,\" Dr Lo, a Senior Lecturer in Climate Change at Victoria University in Wellington, told Newshub. Transport is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand, and is up 16.6 percent from 2005. \"This is mainly due to road transport and there are little incentives to improve public transport systems, especially for long-distance travel,\" Dr Lo said. \"Things like the  Transmission Gully in Wellington  is an example showing NZ is still addicted to private transport - NZ car ownership per capita is among the highest in the world. Our major cities are small and far away from each other, making public transport inefficient and encouraging us to fly.\" There are some encouraging signs. More electric vehicles (EVs) were registered in New Zealand in the six months following the introduction of the Government's Clean Car Discount rebate scheme last year than in 2017, 2018, 2019, or 2020. It led to a 15 percent reduction in emissions from new imported vehicles and a more than tripling of the number of new EVs being sold each month. Rebates of up to $8625 for imported EVs are funded by charging the purchase of high-emitting vehicles up to $5175. Vehicles with moderate emissions get neither a rebate nor a charge. But agriculture emissions remain the largest source of emissions in New Zealand. Methane emissions from livestock in 2019 were up 9 percent from 1990 and down 1.6 percent from 2005. Nitrous oxide emissions were up 45.3 percent from 1990 and up 5.9 percent from 2005. Agriculture is the only sector not currently facing a price in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), so in 2019, the Government decided to price agricultural emissions and asked the Interim Climate Change Committee to advise on how this could be done. But the agricultural sector didn't want the Government to determine this on their own. Sector leaders proposed that the Government work in partnership through a proposal called He Waka Eke Noa. The industry has until 2025 to come up with a solution or else fall into the ETS. But even if agriculture is put into the ETS,  it would get a 95 percent discount . A recent discussion document  showed the current proposed arrangement by the industry would lead to reductions in total agricultural emissions of less than 1 percent below 2017 levels, at a cost of up to $430 million per annum. \"We should include agricultural emissions in the NZ ETS,\" Dr Lo said. \"Be reminded that we do not have a history of successfully meeting emission reduction targets under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),\" Dr Lo said. Under the UNFCCC's 1997 Kyoto Protocol CP1 (2008-2012), New Zealand was expected to return our emissions to 1990 levels. Instead,  our emissions were up by 33 percent . The Zero Carbon Act, passed in 2019, sets a target of zero carbon emissions by 2050, and reducing methane emissions by between 24 to 47 percent by 2050. But the\u00a0 Climate Change Commission warned the Government in June \u00a0that the Government's policies were not good enough to meet its targets and that methane would need to be reduced by 49 to 60 percent below 2017 levels.\u00a0 New Zealand is one of the few countries to have a net zero emissions by 2050 goal enshrined in law, but based on current policies, the international Climate Action Tracker  ranks us as \"highly insufficient\" .\u00a0 New Zealand now has a new emissions target, announced by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in November last year. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), New Zealand's target to help meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, was changed from a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 to a 50 percent reduction. But Climate Change Minister James Shaw was  warned by Treasury  that his climate target was too ambitious, too expensive and could be setting New Zealand up to fail. He was also accused of  using \"clever accounting\" to make the target look better . Dr Lo echoed the criticism from environmental groups of the Government's plan to buy international carbon offsets to meet our goals - as much as two-thirds of our emissions reduction target. \"As something doing research into carbon offsetting, I have no idea where the NZ Government could get such a large number of quality carbon offsets from abroad.\" That's not to say offsetting emissions by planting trees doesn't work. In 2021, forests in the ETS sequestered 6.7 million tonnes of CO2 which is equivalent to the annual emissions from 2.5 million cars. The Government is now  looking at ways to ensure the right trees are planted in the right place for the right reason . The Climate Change Minister is aware of how dire the situation is. \"Our Emissions Reduction Plan, which will be published next month, will set out how we will reduce emissions across every sector of the economy,\" he said on Tuesday. \"There are those who will try and tell you, when it comes to climate change, New Zealand is too small to be counted - this report should well and truly dispel us of that notion. We are part of the problem and we must be part of the solution.\" Finance Minister Grant Robertson has given himself $6 billion for the upcoming Budget and $4.5 billion is expected to go towards the new Climate Emergency Response Fund, which will spend proceeds from the ETS on initiatives to combat climate challenges. In the meantime,\u00a0 there are resources available for farmers \u00a0to reduce their emissions, though Federated Farmers is pushing for more use of products like Bovaer, which goes in animal feed and is said to have the potential to cut methane emissions by up to 30 percent.", "headline": "Climate lecturer's warning: New Zealand 'not making any transformative change to meet world's targets'", "article_name": "climate-lecturer-s-warning-new-zealand-not-making-any-transformative-change-to-meet-world-s-targets", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2022/04/climate-lecturer-s-warning-new-zealand-not-making-any-transformative-change-to-meet-world-s-targets.html", "date_published": "2022-04-06 11:10:02", "article_length": 7276, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:32.278328"}

Credits: Video - Newshub; Images - Getty By Judy Lawrence, Alistair Woodward, Anita Wreford and Mark John Costello of The Conversation Climate change impacts in Aotearoa New Zealand are real and future risks are high, according to the latest report released today by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ). The\u00a0 report \u00a0is part of the IPCC\u2019s\u00a0 Sixth Assessment \u00a0and focuses on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability to climate change. It highlights that some impacts such as sea-level rise are now unavoidable in the near-term, irrespective of the emissions trajectory, and will require new, larger-scale and timely adaptation efforts. At 1.1\u2103 above pre-industrial temperatures, climate change is already affecting New Zealand\u2019s natural and managed land and water systems, coastal areas, glaciers and oceans. Impacts include extreme weather, heat waves, heavy and more frequent rainfall, droughts, fire, changing seasons and sea-level rise. Some impacts are projected to become widespread and systematically pervasive, and potentially irreversible, if average global temperature rises by 1.5\u20132\u2103. But if we take action immediately to limit global warming to 1.5\u2103, the losses and damage to human systems and ecosystems in Aotearoa will be less, albeit not completely avoidable. Sea-level rise will continue, even with rapid cuts to emissions. Beyond 2040, projected impacts could be several times higher than those we currently observe. Without interventions, our region faces increasing food production failures and nutrition-related diseases, mental health impacts, new water-borne diseases and many harmful effects of extreme heat. This decade is critical for effective adaptation. Rising temperatures and more heavy rainfall are damaging to health. For instance, heavy rainfall increases the chances New Zealand children will be\u00a0 admitted to hospital with gut infections . Glaciers and kelp forests are shrinking, and communities dependent on these systems are already affected by growing economic and social costs from compounding climate change impacts. Those who are already socially disadvantaged are affected the most. As global temperatures rise, the risks to our human and natural systems become greater. The scale and speed of global emissions cuts will determine whether the impacts of climate change outpace our ability to adapt. The IPCC\u2019s earlier\u00a0 report , released in August last year, found it is now most likely global warming will reach or exceed 1.5\u2103 during the 2030s. This will be challenging. Communities in low-lying coastal areas face more flooding and progressive risks from storm surges and sea-level rise. This means more costly damages, potential loss of insurance, relocation, community dislocation and increasing inequality. Accelerating our adaptation efforts and cutting emissions will give us a greater chance of reducing current and future impacts. The report reiterates we have the knowledge to adapt to many of these impacts if temperatures do not rise much beyond 1.5\u2103. Examples include changing sowing or harvesting times in agriculture and developing adaptation strategies for river and coastal flooding by local government that are flexible to changing risk. But there is a wide gap between what is happening now and what is needed, in terms of investment, planning, implementation and monitoring and evaluation. To date, Aotearoa has typically focused on recovery after disasters. Investing before extreme events happen can seem expensive, but it is likely to be cheaper in the long run. The necessary investment to improve resilience before disasters happen will require strong community and sector engagement to include long-term impacts and costs into decision making. The report stresses that investing in adaptation efforts now will not only be cheaper, but easier and more effective than delaying action. The effectiveness of adaptation measures will decline with increased warming. Delaying adaptation raises the exposure of people to risks and shifts the burden to future generations and the most vulnerable, which is unfair. As the impacts and costs of climate change increase over time, our financial systems could become less stable and the government less able to support those affected, placing a greater burden on New Zealanders and increasing existing vulnerabilities and inequalities. Climate change in other countries will affect New Zealand through its impacts on international trade, including supply chains for goods and services and impacts on our trading partners. Other pressures will flow on to New Zealand from humanitarian crises related to conflicts, food shortages, sea-level rise, extreme weather events and migration within and between countries. The most effective adaptation is integrated and coordinated across governance levels. It is also inclusive of diverse cultures, ages and societal groups. M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori knowledge based on human-nature relationships and social-cultural networks that promote collective action already informs our adaptation effort and has a strong role going forward, while also upholding M\u0101ori interests under Treaty of Waitangi obligations. Drawing together different ways of knowing will be even more important in the future to ensure consistent efforts to protect the integrity of our ecosystems on land and in the ocean. Protecting our natural land and ocean systems will be essential to ensure they in turn protect our well-being in a warming world. Think of trees in urban areas providing cooling or wetlands moderating flood waters. We are already removing invasive species to safeguard native biodiversity and this will be even more urgent if climate change boosts their populations. We need to adapt infrastructure to better protect drinking water supplies and support health services. Such improvements will generate benefits to New Zealanders beyond climate change. But they won\u2019t happen without long-term planning, coherence across all areas of policy and robust and consistent political commitment. New risks for Aotearoa arise from the scale of cascading and compounding impacts which become even greater after 1.5\u2103. This increases the urgency for adaptation, but adaptation effectiveness has limits. Global and national efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are a prerequisite to successful adaptation. Further delay will make climate change vulnerabilities worse, more expensive and difficult to address.

Low-income households are set to bear the brunt of the transition to a low emissions economy, according to a discussion document released today. Climate Change Minister James Shaw today released the 'Our Climate Your Say' document, inviting New Zealanders to help decide new climate change law and how we can transition smoothly. The document lays out three possible pathways to a lower-emissions economy, including net zero carbon by 2050, net zero long-lived gases and stabilised short-lived gases by 2050 (reducing emissions of long-lived gases like carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide while stabilising gases like methane) and net zero emissions by 2050, which covers all gases. It says under any of the three targets there will be significant increases in new forest planting and emissions reductions in transport and energy, as well as changes in how we use our land. Mr Shaw says the Zero Carbon Bill is designed to create certainty, with a clear emissions target and pathway to get there, which he hopes will drive investment in new industries and create new jobs. But the transition will not affect all Kiwis equally. The document reveals that the transition will be felt more strongly by lower-income households because a higher proportion of their spending is on products and services that are likely to increase as we reduce emissions. That's because businesses could pass on the transition costs to consumers, such as the price of petrol that will increase as the carbon price increases. \"Households that are in the lowest 20 percent bracket for income may be more than twice as affected, on a relative basis, than those households with an average income. \"The Government has a number of tools it could choose to use to compensate affected households for higher costs, such as tax or welfare measures,\" it says. Mr Shaw says this could be avoided by Government being proactive. \n He says policies like the home insulation scheme, funding for public transport and the families package will help offset the impact on low-income families. The document issues the reminder that the costs of transition must be considered alongside things like New Zealand's international reputation and the brand our businesses want to project globally. There are other costs New Zealand is already feeling from climate change, for example in the past 10 years the cost of weather events to our transport network has increased from about $20 million per year to over $90 million per year. Reports from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment show the cost of replacing every building within half a metre of the average high tide mark could be $3 billion and within 1.5 metres as much as $19 to $20 billion.

Doing so will avoid the absolute worst effects of climate change, scientists say, but attendees at COP26 in Glasgow have settled on something that could result in a rise nearly twice that, James Shaw told The AM Show on Thursday. \"It's not as ambitious as we'd like. These decision texts tend to represent - because every country has to agree to it - they tend to represent the lowest common denominator.\" One of the negotiators,  speaking to  The Guardian  anonymously , told the paper the text is \"devoid of ambition\". Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan said the deal \"is not a plan to solve the climate crisis, it's an agreement that we'll all cross our fingers and hope for the best\".\u00a0 \"It's a polite request that countries maybe, possibly, do more next year. Well, that's not good enough and the negotiators shouldn't even think about leaving this city until they've agreed a deal that meets the moment. Because most assuredly, this one does not.\" Most attendees will likely leave after negotiations end on Friday (UK time), leaving behind a frustrated Shaw. \"I have been in meetings and I have been cross with people. There are countries that are really dragging the chain.\" He wouldn't name any, saying he was on a \"diplomatic mission and we're still in the middle of it\". \"I'm not going to tell you what's going on in those negotiations. But there are some tensions which are going to affect the outcome. That's kind of how these things work.\"\u00a0 The  draft conclusion  acknowledges current pledges to reduce emissions are insufficient, and says countries should \"strengthen\" their reductions, particularly in the near-term.\u00a0 It urges countries to hurry up moves to end the use of coal, and put a stop to fossil fuel subsidies, but doesn't set a date.\u00a0 The draft says to stop Earth heating beyond the 1.5C threshold, carbon emissions must drop 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels, and reach net zero by 2050. On current pledges, they will increase 14 percent on 2010 levels by 2030.\u00a0 Developed countries are encouraged to \"urgently scale up\" aid to help poorer nations adapt to the effects of climate change, since they're likely to feel them most; but says aid should be in grants, not loans, which merely saddle poor nations with more debt. Previous promises of billions in donations haven't been met, Reuters reported.\u00a0 Whatever is finally agreed on Friday will not be legally binding.\u00a0 Despite the disappointment, Shaw says things are moving in the right direction - just not fast enough. \"If you went back say about a year or so, 18 months ago, the collective targets of countries around the world added up to about a 3.5C to 4C scenario - that would be absolutely catastrophic. Now there's been a lot of countries - including New Zealand - who have strengthened their targets in the intervening period of time, and that now adds up to\u2026 between 1.8C and 2.7C. Neither of those get us 1.5C obviously, but you can see the collective will of countries increasing their targets is starting to bend the curve in the right direction.\u00a0 \"The problem is that we've only got this decade to cut global emissions by about 45 percent, which is what the IPCC said is required. So yeah, we still need to lift our ambition around the world to make sure that we actually do stay within that.\"\u00a0 New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions  have stayed relatively stable since 2005 . Per capita carbon emissions have actually been falling since then. The biggest drop came in 2020, likely due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. We have about 0.06 percent of the world's population, but account for 0.011 percent of emissions - nearly double our fair share.\u00a0 \"We just increased our target shortly before I came here, and there are a number of countries around the world that haven't changed their targets since they first lodged it in 2016,\" said Shaw. \"The science has moved on considerably since then, so we do know that we actually need to continue to put pressure on those countries that haven't lifted their game to do so.\"", "headline": "Climate change: James Shaw slams countries at COP26 'dragging the chain' on emissions, but won't name names", "article_name": "climate-change-james-shaw-slams-countries-at-cop26-dragging-the-chain-on-emissions-but-won-t-name-names", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2021/11/climate-change-james-shaw-slams-countries-at-cop26-dragging-the-chain-on-emissions-but-won-t-name-names.html", "date_published": "2021-11-11 08:45:37", "article_length": 4315, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:33.338911"}

The Green Party announced a new Kiwi Climate Fund on Sunday, vowing if it gets into Parliament, things will have to change in order to protect the environment. Leader James Shaw says all climate pollution will be charged - including agriculture, which is currently exempt. \"We're the first generation that will feel the effects of climate change, and the last that can stop it,\" he says. \"No farmer I've talked to wants their child to inherit a world with longer droughts and drier rivers. Agriculture can no longer be exempt from reducing climate pollution; farmers need to be part of the solution.\" The actual charge would be determined by an independent Climate Commission, which Mr Shaw says will be a top priority in Government. The aim is to reduce climate pollution to net zero by 2020. Around 1.2 billion trees would be planted across the country with the revenue from the charges, and any surplus would be returned to Kiwis over 18. \"We estimate this could be $250 per person in 2020,\" Mr Shaw says. He says by 2020, it's likely the charge on carbon dioxide would be around $40 per tonne, and nitrous oxide and methane emissions from agriculture would be charged $6 and $3 per tonne, respectively. The cost would be reduced by farmers planting trees on their land. Even the Super and ACC Funds would be affected by the change. \"We'll ensure the Government walks the talk by directing the Super Fund and ACC Fund to completely divest from fossil fuel companies, so that pensions are not dependent on economically risky and environmentally toxic investments,\" Mr Shaw says. Mr Shaw also says there won't be any new coal mines, fracking or deep sea oil drilling with a Green Government.

{"id": null, "body": "Polar bear.  Credits: Pic - Getty, video - Newshub Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says climate change is \"my generation's nuclear-free moment,\" but new research shows the damage to New Zealand could be as bad as an actual nuclear attack. Multiple reports in recent months have painted a worrying picture of the future for New Zealand's climate and sea levels. The UN World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said in its Greenhouse Gas Bulletin this week that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide grew at record rate in 2016. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main man-made greenhouse gas, hit 403.3 parts per million (ppm) in 2016. The last time carbon dioxide levels reached 400 ppm was 3-5 million years ago, in the mid-Pliocene era, and the WMO warns this could potentially add 3degC to temperatures and fuel a 20-metre rise in sea levels. NIWA's Chief Scientist for Climate, Atmosphere and Hazards, Dr Sam Dean, warns the rise could be even higher - as much as 40-metres. \"Under such a scenario records from the Earth's history suggest sea levels could ultimately rise from between 10-40 m,\" he says. \"Scientists currently believe if we can keep the warming of the Earth's atmosphere to below 2 degrees then we are likely to avoid such an outcome.\" Dr Dean says this is based upon a number of techniques in paleoclimate research, the primary one being the identification of raised beaches and undersea deposits on land that is currently above sea level and in a geologically stable location. The water for the rise is mostly expected to come from melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and would have a \"quite significant\" effect on New Zealand. But there is some comfort.\u00a0 \"It is expected that this will take 1000 years to occur,\" Dr Dean says. New Zealand has played its part in causing the damage. The country's gross greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 24 percent since 1990, half of which come from agriculture, according to the Ministry for the Environment and Statistics New Zealand report released earlier in October. It's already taking a significant toll. The country's glaciers have lost a quarter of their volume since 1977, and sea levels have risen by up to 22cm in the past century throughout our main ports. A Ministry for the Environment report was delivered to the Government in April, warning sea levels could rise 30cm-40cm by 2050. This would mean 133,000 people were at risk of \"higher levels of coastal erosion\". Insurance Council chief executive Tim Grafton says almost 70,000 properties may be uninsurable within 20 to 30 years. \"If nothing is done to reduce risk that will almost be a certainty in some parts of New Zealand,\" he says. \"The whole point of this is not to scaremonger, but actually to say, reality check everybody - we need to address this issue with some seriousness so that in a few decades time we're not in that position.\" He says there are already pockets of New Zealand where it is difficult to get insurance due to rising sea levels. \"People seem to think that these things won't affect them in their lifetime because they believe the extreme events from climate change lie decades away.\" And the damage is already beginning. This year has already seen devastating weather events cause havoc in Edgecumbe and Otago. Figures show weather-related claims are now at the highest since records began, with more than $230 million paid out this year. In March, the Auckland suburb of New Lynn flooded after a massive deluge swamped streets and storm water systems were overwhelmed. And the research shows water networks like these will soon be under even more pressure. The new Deep South report found we can soon expect higher sea levels leading to increased sewage overflows and salt water corrosion in pipes. More frequent coastal storms will cause inundation, physical damage and treatment plant failures - as well as extreme rainfall and droughts. \"We need to start to transition our infrastructure to a model that's more appropriate for the weather patterns and sea level rise that we can expect,\" says University of Waikato Professor of Environmental Planning Iain White. It is also likely to exacerbate socio-economic and ethnic health inequalities, according to a report from Royal Society Te Aparangi released in October. \"If we think of the basic building blocks of health, such as our shelter, the air we breathe, water we drink and the food we eat, all will be affected by climate change,\" society president Professor Richard Bedford said. He said New Zealand could expect: There could also be social and mental disruption if people had to relocate and repeated stresses could take a toll on mental health. However it may already be too late to stop runaway global warning. \u00a0The Ministry for the Environment and Statistics New Zealand report warns that even if we took all possible precautions now, it would take \"centuries\" before some aspects of climate change levelled off. \"New Zealand's climate will continue to warm in the short term due to the cumulative effect of past emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, which can persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years.\" Dr Dean echoes this warning. \"We can expect 20-30cm of sea level rise by 2050 with reasonable certainty. However the amount of sea level rise we get at the end of the century is very much dependant on human emissions of greenhouse gases in the years ahead,\" he says. \"It is too late to prevent another 20cm of sea level rise.\" Newshub. \u00a0", "headline": "Climate change: Sea level rise inevitable ", "article_name": "climate-change-sea-level-rise-inevitable", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2017/10/climate-change-sea-level-rise-inevitable.html", "date_published": "2017-10-31 14:21:15", "article_length": 5531, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:34.206301"}

After meeting with Prince William, Ms Ardern was on the Safeguarding Our Planet panel with environmentalist Sir David Attenborough and former US Vice President Al Gore, to discuss climate change. Calling climate change the biggest threat to our world, Ms Ardern said the short-term political cycle made it difficult for politicians to invest in long-term infrastructure to take action on it. However, she said it was her aim to create legislation \"that embeds those targets, that ambition that we need\" and \"endures beyond us as individuals\". She gave a shout-out to her government's billion tree programme as an example of an investment that \"will set us on a long-term path for guardianship\".

Future proofing society and the economy was the \"only option\", she said. When asked by Mr Gore if she could think of a man or woman who didn't want to do anything about climate change - a potential attempt to get Ms Ardern to speak about US President Donald Trump - and what she would say to them, the Prime Minister said she would show them the effect of global warming on the Pacific Islands.

{"id": null, "body": "\n By Seth Borenstein With the planet heating up, many scientists seem fairly certain some weather elements like hurricanes and droughts will worsen. But tornadoes have them stumped. These unpredictable, sometimes deadly storms plague the United States more than any other country. In tornado alley, Oklahoma City has been hit with at least 147 tornadoes since 1890. But as the traditional tornado season nears, scientists have been pondering a simple question: Will there be more or fewer twisters as global warming increases? There is no easy answer. Lately, tornado activity in America has been Jekyll-and-Hyde weird, and scientists are unsure if climate change has played a role in recent erratic patterns. In 2011, the United   States saw its second-deadliest tornado season in history: Nearly 1,700 tornadoes killed 553 people. The Joplin, Mo., twister was the single deadliest in American history, killing 158 people and causing US$2.8 billion in damage. The following year, 2012, started even earlier and even busier. Through April there were twice as many tornadoes as normal. Then the twisters suddenly disappeared. Tornado activity from May to August of that year was the lowest in 60 years of record-keeping, said Harold Brooks, a top researcher at the National Weather Centre in Norman, Okla. Meanwhile, Canada saw an unusual number of tornadoes in 2012; Saskatchewan had three times the normal number. That year, the jet stream moved north and \"essentially shut down\" tornadoes in the American Midwest said Greg Carbin, warning meteorologist at the federal storm centre. A tremendous drought meant far fewer storms, which not only shut off the spigot on rain but on storm cells that spawned tornadoes. For much of America, tornadoes are seasonal. Typically, there are more during spring, and the numbers dwindle in the worst heat of the summer. Last year \"essentially was an extended period of summertime conditions over the US,\" Carbin said. \"The real question is: What is spring now? Is it February?\" \"Summer may be happening earlier and may be muscling out what we consider a transition between summer and winter,\" he said. The last two seasons aren't alone in illustrating extremes in tornado activity. Tornado record-keepers tally things like the most and least tornadoes in a month. Records for that category have been set 24 times over the past 60 years. Ten of those records have been set in the past decade - six for the fewest tornadoes and four for the most, Brooks said. Also, the three earliest starts of tornado season and the four latest have all occurred since 1997, he said. What does that mean? \"We've had a dramatic increase in the variability of tornado occurrence,\" Brooks said. The jet stream, a major player in tornado formation, has been in a state of flux, varying wildly in recent years, said Pennsylvania State  University climate scientist Michael Mann. \"It's hard to predict future tornado seasons when we don't understand current tornado seasons,\" Brooks said between sessions at the National Tornado Summit here earlier this week. \"We're not sure what's going to happen with the tornado numbers.\" A new study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society looks at all sorts of extreme weather, how it is changing because of global warming and how things are predicted to change in the future. The study says tornadoes and the severe thunderstorms that spawn them are the hardest to predict. Public opinion polls show Americans blame global warming for bad tornado outbreaks, but climate scientists say that's not quite right. One reason scientists can't figure out how global warming might affect tornadoes is that twisters are usually small weather events that aren't easily simulated in large computer models. And records of tornadoes may not have been accurate over the years as twisters twirled unnoticed around unpopulated areas. So Brooks and others are looking at the ingredients that cause tornadoes. But even that isn't simple. They look at two main factors: moist energy in the atmosphere and wind shear. Wind shear is the difference between wind at high altitudes and wind near the surface. The more moist energy and greater the wind shear, the better the chances for tornadoes. The atmosphere can hold more moisture as it warms, and it will likely be more unstable so that means more moist energy, several experts said. But wind shear is another matter. Brooks and Stanford University scientist Noah Diffenbaugh think there will be less of that. That would suggest fewer tornadoes. But if there's more moist energy, that could lead to more tornadoes. One ingredient has to win out, and Brooks says it's hard to tell which one will. Diffenbaugh says recent computer simulations show the moist energy may overcome the reduced shear and produce at least more severe thunderstorms, if not tornadoes. Given what's happening lately, Brooks believes there will be fewer days of tornadoes but more twisters on the days when they occur.

Credits: Video - Newshub Nation; Image - Getty Images Lakes in New Zealand and around the world are rapidly losing oxygen, scientists say, putting biodiversity and access to fresh drinking water at risk.\u00a0 Since 1980, oxygen levels deep in 400 different lakes in temperate regions around the world - including Taup\u014d, Tarawera and Brunner - have dropped significantly, according to new research  published in  Nature . At the surface, they have on average 5.6 percent less than 40 years ago. In deep water, there's 18.6 percent less oxygen.\u00a0 And in the few lakes where oxygen concentrations have risen, it's been accompanied by blooms of toxin-releasing cyanobacteria. \"All complex life depends on oxygen. It's the support system for aquatic food webs,\" said Kevin Rose, freshwater ecologist at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York. And when you start losing oxygen, you have the potential to lose species. Lakes are losing oxygen 2.75-9.3 times faster than the oceans, a decline that will have impacts throughout the ecosystem.\" While lakes only cover about 3 percent of the surface of the Earth, they \"contain a disproportionate concentration of the planet's biodiversity\".\u00a0 \"Lakes are indicators or 'sentinels' of environmental change and potential threats to the environment because they respond to signals from the surrounding landscape and atmosphere,\" said lead author Stephen Jane, also of Rensselaer. \"We found that these disproportionally more biodiverse systems are changing rapidly, indicating the extent to which ongoing atmospheric changes have already impacted ecosystems.\" Warm water can't hold as much oxygen, which explains the declining concentration at the surface.\u00a0 But deeper down, where oxygen losses have been far more extreme, temperatures have remained stable. The scientists say that's because the temperature difference between surface and deep water has increased, resulting in \"stratification\" and less mixing between the two - so oxygen at the bottom isn't replenished. \"The increase in stratification makes the mixing or renewal of oxygen from the atmosphere to deep waters more difficult and less frequent, and deep-water dissolved oxygen drops as a result,\" said Dr Rose.

Ardern said during the debate she'd have \"no issue\" with declaring a climate emergency after it was previously voted down in Parliament last year. \"It is an emergency and everything we've done demonstrates that,\" Ardern said. \"An emergency in real terms means stopping future offshore oil and gas exploration.\"\u00a0 National leader Judith Collins said her plan to tackle climate change would be to support New Zealand farmers by \"giving them the science\" to help them cut carbon emissions. \"What we do not do is that we do not beggar them and our country to an order so that we can go and get a photo op somewhere.\" New Zealand would join the UK, Canada, Ireland and France by declaring a climate emergency. So far only local councils have done, including regional bodies in Wellington, Auckland, Nelson, Canterbury, Waikato and Southland.

Time is running out though - and not just in light of  scientists' warnings  that the world needs to act now to combat rising temperatures. For anyone  wanting to give feedback  on the council's plan to fight climate change, the deadline is September 30. Auckland Council opened public feedback on its  Climate Action Framework  in mid-July. Since then, there have been more than 2000 responses, says Alec Tang, the council's acting chief sustainability officer. \"[It's] really positive for us in terms of people actually wanting to act on climate and not just talk about climate.\" The public submissions period gives individuals and NGOs the chance to weigh in on the framework, telling the council what they agree with and what they want to be changed. Tang told Newshub that individuals can play a \"big role\" in influencing the framework, by \"adding to and expanding on some of the things that we put in there, and just showing that awareness and willingness that this is really important to them.\" The framework comes after the council declared a \" climate emergency \" earlier this year. Councillor Penny Hulse says since then Aucklanders have given a \"strong, clear message that council needs to take the lead in climate action.\" \"I feel that there\u2019s also an increase in sophistication around Aucklanders\u2019 attitudes to climate change \u2013 that there\u2019s a willingness to act, but a realisation that we need broad systems change \u2013 not just individual action,\" says Hulse. The framework sets out 11 key moves aimed at tackling greenhouse emissions in the city, as well as addressing climate impacts such as rising sea levels, increased flooding and accelerating losses in biodiversity and habitats. Bruce Kidd, from youth-led climate organisation  Generation Zero , says it's a chance for Aucklanders to show they take the issue seriously. \"We must be a leader in addressing climate change to the rest of the country.\" Kidd said various submission parties had been organised to make the process easier for people. \"While there are good parts of the framework, there are some areas that need to be strengthened. \"This is particularly so in having clear targets for each action and people who are clearly accountable for following through on them. The council recently declaring a climate emergency makes this even more important. We must have a climate framework that aligns with the urgency of a climate emergency.\" Tang says although ambitious, the goals are \"definitely achievable\".\u00a0 \"The question is: how willing are we to action them best? \"Without a doubt, achieving the outcomes that we've set is doable as long as we invest appropriately and recognise the issues if we don't.\" The challenge now is for everybody to get on the same page and turn talk into action.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty A popular climate sceptic theory - that the Earth's recent warming is simply a return to the norm after an unusually cool period - has now been busted, scientists say. The 'Little Ice Age'  lasted from the Renaissance period until about 1850, and saw parts of Europe and North America suffer chilling winters, with rivers frequently frozen over and crops failing. The Earth has warmed considerably since then as we all know, with climate scientists blaming the rapid rise in emissions of greenhouse gases since the mid-1800s. Sceptics have long argued that if climate change is happening it's a natural process - and to be expected after centuries of cooler temperatures. But  two new studies , published Thursday in journals  Nature  and  Nature Geoscience , have found the recent upswing in temperatures worldwide is unprecedented. They looked at not just recorded temperature data, but other evidence closely linked with temperature, such as tree rings, ice cores, lake sediments and corals.\u00a0 \"It's true that during the Little Ice Age it was generally colder across the whole world,\" said lead author of one of the studies Raphael Neukom, \"but not everywhere at the same time. The peak periods of pre-industrial warm and cold periods occurred at different times in different places.\" With a lack of data from other parts of the world, previous research only looked at North America and Europe.\u00a0 \"In the absence of data from other parts of the Earth, this notion was applied to the whole planet, raising expectations that relatively cold or warm periods throughout the last 2000 years were globally synchronous phenomena. But it has now been shown that this was not the case,\" the researchers said in a statement. It got cold in different places at different times largely due to local phenomena - usually volcanic eruptions - and random fluctuations, the new research found.\u00a0 \"The coldest temperatures... occurred in central and eastern Pacific regions in the 15th century, in northwestern Europe and southeastern North America in the 17th century, and elsewhere during the 19th century,\" the researchers said. Even the Medieval Warm Period - which preceded the Little Ice Age - affected less than half the planet.\u00a0 In contrast, the recent change in temperatures - a constant, fast rise - has affected 98 percent of the world. \"This shows - once again - that modern climate change cannot be explained by random fluctuations, but by anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases,\" the researchers said.\u00a0 \"What we didn't know until now is that not only average global temperatures in the 20th century are higher than ever before in at least 2000 years, but also that a warming period is now affecting the whole planet at the same time for the first time. And the speed of global warming has never been as high as it is today.\" \"There is no doubt left - as has been shown extensively in many other studies addressing many different aspects of the climate system using different methods and data sets,\" Stefan Br\u00f6nniman, who led the second study,  told the  Guardian . Paleoclimatologist Jennifer Hertzberg  told  NBC News  the studies were \"very important\" and should spark action. \"The global temperatures that we're seeing now are higher than they have been in the last 2000 years,\" she told the broadcaster. \"What we're seeing now is uncharted territory.

{"id": null, "body": "By Harry Lock of RNZ Local councils need more say over critical areas like climate change and housing, says an appeal from Local Government NZ. The plea to the next Government from the agency representing all local governments is part of its \"election manifesto\". They're calling for action in five policy areas; all are bound by the collective issue of \"democratic wellbeing\", or lack of it. The term is used to define the balance of decision-making between local and central government. \"New Zealand is one of the most centralised decision-making countries in the OECD,\" Local Government NZ president Stuart Crosby said. \"Our goal is to get at the beginning of the conversations in terms of policy decisions, so we can assist the government of the day in terms of making good policy decisions that will actually work on the ground.\" Councils in New Zealand spend just over 10 percent of the entire country's budget. In comparison, the average for countries in the OECD is 46 percent. The organisation said giving councils more power, more influence and more say would lead to financial efficiency, improved public services for local communities, and increase voter turnout and engagement. The manifesto - or \"wishlist\" - looks at five different areas where they argue \"democratic well-being\" needs to be urgently improved: climate change, housing, transport, local democracy and the environment. It outlines policies to address the decision-making imbalance: Crosby said local expertise, knowledge and nous needed to be drawn on. \"The key is [although] often senior officials in Wellington have the good ideas, [they] fail to understand what the ramifications are on the ground with the local community,\" Crosby said. \"That's where we believe we can assist in that space.\" The National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management, which came into effect earlier this month, is being heralded as an example of when central government got it right. The Chair of the regional sector for Local Government NZ, Doug Leeder, said local government officials were involved from the start, and were able to make changes which meant the final version was a vast improvement on previous drafts. \"That reflected essentially the regional councils concerns around saying, 'well you need to understand that if the policy as prescribed is to be played out, the difficulties in terms of implementation, monitoring and enforcement, all have to be considered'.\" With regional councils playing the regulatory role for the policy, he said it was essential they were involved in the outcome of the policy. \"At the end of the day, a lot of the problems that we're endeavouring to address, whether it's urban development, or it's freshwater degradation - they're a consequence of people. \"If people embrace that, and say collectively we've contributed to the problem, and collectively we'll resolve it, then we'll be in a better place.\" Leeder - also the chair of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council - said that's how policy-making should be designed. Hamilton mayor Paula Southgate said they have significant infrastructure costs looming, and the current funding model - which relies on the ratepayer - provides insufficient income to deliver such projects. \"The future is huge,\" she said. \"We've got a lot of growth, we've got a lot of ageing infrastructure, and we've got a lot of new infrastructure that we need to put in place, such as through the Three Waters, the need to increase standards for drinking water, to deal with our wastewater and stormwater. \"They're huge costs.\" With such a miniscule pot to draw from, there needed to be a re-assessment of where local councils can find the funding. \"We can't keep tapping into the ratepayers, we need some more incentives to get over the hurdles we face right now, and that will deliver huge economic and social benefits.\" Stuart Crosby said re-examining how local government funds its services has been a conversation for more than a decade, but for councils with a burgeoning population which are now at breaking point, they need action.

{"id": null, "body": "Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern Photo: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone\r\n  The Prime Minister says it is incredibly encouraging that  the Climate Change Commission's first official report shows  that reaching our emissions reduction goals are both achievable and affordable. The commission's first report, published on Monday, laid out a path to drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris Agreement targets. Three new targets for the country were set: an average reduction of 2 percent each year between 2022 and 2025, 17 percent each year between 2025 and 2030 and 36 percent each year between 2030 and 2035. Commission chair Dr Rod Carr said investing in electric vehicles, renewable energy generation, climate-friendly farming practices and planting more native forests would be critical to meeting the targets. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the draft advice was incredibly encouraging. \"The commission has determined that the economic cost to New Zealand, as I've said, is not as great as previously thought. \"In fact, there are great economic opportunities for new jobs and new business over the coming years as we transition to an emissions free economy.\" However, Ardern said the Government would have to address the problem of costs not being distributed evenly across communities. While the National Party cautiously welcomed the report, it said more analysis was needed. The party's climate change spokesperson Stuart Smith questioned whether the proposals were the most cost-effective way of reducing emissions. He said he would like to see the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) get more use. \"Overseas evidence shows that those policies are incredibly cost inefficient and what we have in New Zealand is a very effective ETS, it's a very well-designed system and what we really need to do is utilise that,\" he said. \"That puts a price on emissions, and consumers and businesses will make the decision themselves on how to lower those emissions.\" Climate Minister James Shaw said the release of the draft advice was a significant milestone in the Government's response to the climate emergency. He said the report had significant implications for forestry, with a recommendation to move away from pine forests, often used as carbon credits in the Emissions Trading Scheme. \"They really want to change the way that we think about forestry from a kind of a short-term carbon sink through pine afforestation and rotational forestry into a much greater use of permanent indigenous forestry as a long-term carbon sink for the country as well,\" he said. Professor Troy Baisden, president of the New Zealand Association of Scientists, supported the report's suggestions but said more detail on agriculture was needed. \"Given that agriculture accounts for nearly half of New Zealand's current emissions, the report contains relatively little detail on agriculture and land use, except for reductions achieved by forests,\" he said. This reflected the difficulty and uncertainty in achieving emissions reductions in agriculture and projecting them forward, he said. \"The commission's analysis briefly notes significant yet uncertain areas of potential, such as an ongoing conversion from grazed pastures toward high-value horticulture, such as wine and fruit. \"However, a significant gap is understanding the potential for the growth of a bioenergy sector, and whether this might start to resemble agriculture more than forestry.\" Baisden said this uncertainty around agriculture represented a challenge for the future that would need to be addressed by new science. \"Getting such science in place will make New Zealand more competitive, and less dependent on the commission's recommendation to continue buying emissions reductions overseas. \"It will also help project a path forward that will enable innovation throughout our motu, and heed the commission's prerogative that \"'climate related policies do not further compound historic grievances for Ma\u0304ori.'\" University of Canterbury political scientist Professor Bronwyn Hayward said that while the report showed we weren't doing our fair share to tackle climate change, there was plenty we could do to improve. \"We can achieve our Paris climate goals at lower costs than we expected and the commission says we can do it with existing technology and we don't (and shouldn't) have to plant as many exotic pine forests either.\" She said the rates of change the commission had proposed - reducing emissions by 2 percent net each year to 2025 - were very gentle. \"To put this into perspective, recent research suggests that the country as a whole managed to reduce our emissions by an astonishing 41 percent for the period of our first level four lockdown,\" she said. \"We don't want to put our society on hold for four weeks every year to reduce emissions. But that experience does give us an idea of what the power of collective action could do.\" The commission's advice includes: The draft advice is now open for consultation until March 14 and final advice will be released before May 31. The Government has pledged to release an Emissions Reduction Plan before the end of the year after receiving the final advice, which will set out how the first three emissions budgets will be achieved.

The Government gave $18 million to 22 projects to help educate farmers on how to use their land more sustainably, meet environmental targets and better adapt to the effects of climate change. The bulk of the funding - $14.4 million - would go to 12 freshwater mitigation projects over four years, Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said on Thursday. Seven projects focusing on \"adaptation\" would receive funding of $2.8 million of up to three years, and $800,000 would be provided for \"extension\" projects, he said. The freshwater mitigation projects aim to assess the effectiveness of a range of methods for protecting water health and reducing nutrient runoff; including nutrient management techniques, mechanical protection techniques, herd testing and supplements. The adaptation projects focus on improving the food and fibre sector's resilience to a changing climate and helping farmers move towards a low-carbon future. Topics include climate change impact on trade and biosecurity through pests and control, future-proofing irrigation through adaptation and decision-making and assessing risks and planning for resilience to adverse events. Funding for extension projects focuses on translating the latest scientific research into practical information for farmers, so the science can be applied at the farm level.\u00a0 \"The primary sector have told us there are three priority areas where they need more knowledge and tools, so the projects we're funding have been targeted towards those areas: freshwater mitigation, climate adaptation, and climate change extension,\" said O'Connor. \"Our farmers and growers play a vital role in New Zealand's rural communities and economy and will do for the foreseeable future.

Australia also didn't speak at the virtual event, hosted by the United Nations, the UK and France. Some reports have suggested our poor record has put us offside with some of the better-performing countries. Bush fires, sea-level rise and extreme weather events - climate change is unavoidable. More than 80 world leaders and environmentalists took part in the Climate Ambition Summit online. The UK Prime Minister made it clear it's a serious issue for all of humanity - not just greenies. \"We're doing this not because we're hairshirt-wearing, tree-hugging, mung bean-munching eco-freaks,\" Boris Johnson said. Johnson is pledging to reduce the UK's emissions by 68 percent by 2030 and to stop funding fossil fuel projects overseas. \"We can reverse the process by which for centuries, humanity has been quilting our planet in a toxic tea cosy of greenhouse gases,\" he said. Despite declaring a climate emergency just 11 days ago, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern did not speak at the summit. \"This summit was really for countries to make some quite significant announcements. In the time we had available to us we felt we couldn't do it justice,\" Climate Change Minister James Shaw says. Over the ditch, Australia's Prime Minister was reportedly barred from speaking at the summit, with critics claiming it's because his policies are not ambitious enough. \"Global targets are important, but unless those practical targets can be met then they will only remain ambitions and emissions will continue to rise,\" Scott Morrison said. The Australian Institute's director of climate and energy did not hold back in his criticism. \"The Climate Ambition Summit is for those who do the most, not for those who are trying to get away with the least.\" Since 1990 greenhouse gas emissions in New Zealand have risen by nearly 60 percent, and there's criticism not enough is being done about it. Greenpeace says Ardern's promises are not backed by real policy action, and until they are then she shouldn't be included as an ambitious climate leader. \"It must be pretty awkward for Jacinda Ardern to have talked the talk on climate change so strongly internationally and then be excluded for lack of actually implementing any policy that would reduce emissions,\" says spokesperson Niamh O'Flynn. Shaw admits there have been some downfalls. \"Ultimately over the past 30 years New Zealand hasn't really grasped what needs to be done to reduce emissions and stave off climate change.

But New Plymouth Boys' High School student James Macey won't be among them. The 17-year-old says the protests are a \"futile attempt\" to make progress towards a better future. He spoke to Magic Talk's Sean Plunket on Monday about his decision to stay in school, and why he thinks those protesting are making the wrong choice. \"Strikes work because they deprive an employer of something,\" he said on Monday afternoon. \"All this is, is students leaving school, and the school isn't going to miss them. The students are only depriving themselves, because they're missing a day of education.\" The idea to leave school in protest of climate change was started by 16-year-old Swedish student Greta Thunberg, who plans to strike every Friday until Sweden cuts emissions by 15 percent a year. In New Zealand, the protests are being led by 18-year-old Sophie Handford, from Porirua. \"We have the right to fight for our future.

{"id": null, "body": "\n Climate change in Antarctica's Dry Valleys may affect the area more rapidly than previously expected, according to an international team of Antarctic researchers. There has been a longstanding belief that life progresses very slowly in the harsh conditions of environments such as the Dry Valleys. In an effort to conserve the scare resources, changes in ecosystems take place over millennia. However, the scientists have found that microbial communities in the soil undergo rapid and lasting changes in response to current environmental conditions. The team, led by Professor Craig Cary at the University of  Waikato, measured the rate at which observed biological changes occurred beneath a 250-year-old crab-eater seal carcass and at a nearby control site. Under the carcass the soil environment changed by stabilising temperatures, elevating relative humidity and reducing ultraviolet exposure. The scientists then transferred the mummified carcass to an untouched site to find out how quickly these changes occurred. They tracked the changes in microbial composition and structure using community DNA fingerprinting and new sequencing techniques. The mummy leaked nutrients into the soil and trapped moisture under it that would have normally escaped into the air. It took only two years for major changes to occur during the five year study. Their findings have been published this week in the international online science journal  Nature Communications . \"We used to think that changes in microbial change took place slowly over centuries,\" said Professor Cary. \"But the research we've been doing indicates that the bacteria living in the soil are inherently sensitive to climate variability - minor temperature variations could lead to cascading changes in hydrology and biogeochemical cycling and could dramatically affect ecosystem function.\" A recent climate change report for Antarctica predicts the continent may experience more changes as the ozone hole begins to close over the next 50 years, according to Professor Cary. The mummified seal has now been moved back to its original location to see how the microbial communities alter once more. He stressed the importance of continued documentation of the current biodiversity in Antarctica in an effort to predict the effects of climate change. 3 News source: newshub archive", "headline": "Mummified seals reveal effects of climate change in Antarctica", "article_name": "mummified-seals-reveal-effects-of-climate-change-in-antarctica-2012020813", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/environmentsci/mummified-seals-reveal-effects-of-climate-change-in-antarctica-2012020813", "date_published": "1970-01-01 15:12:00", "article_length": 2342, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:38.057520"}
{"id": null, "body": "Watch: World-leading conservationist Jane Goodall on The AM Show.  Credits: The AM Show A world-leading conservationist says the window of time to combat climate change is closing, but change is still possible - and people should not give up hope .\u00a0 English primatologist and anthropologist Jane Goodall is considered to be the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees. Her illustrious career, 60 years of which have been dedicated to the study of the primates, has seen her pen numerous books, the latest of which has just been released as the world struggles to comprehend the escalating crisis of climate change. In a world ravaged by the worsening impacts of global heating, political upheaval and a global pandemic,  The Book of Hope  examines how people can hold onto their optimism - a tool Goodall says is crucial in the fight against climate change. Speaking to The AM Show on Wednesday morning from her childhood home, Goodall, 87, says the world must hold out hope if we are to win the war against the climate crisis - and to do that, people must keep believing that what they do is making a difference. \"If we lose hope, we're doomed. If you don't have hope, if you don't believe that what you do is making a difference - if you don't believe that what other people are doing is making a difference - why bother? Let's give up. Eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die,\" she said. Goodall says her definition of hope is not viewing the world through \"rose-tinted spectacles\", but is having a vision - and taking action to make that vision a reality. \"My definition of hope isn't looking at the world through rose-tinted spectacles and thinking, 'everything is going to be okay'... no. It's about action\u2026 you have to have a vision. Then you work to make that vision a reality,\" she said. \"We have to work out what we can do since we are here, and are likely to be here as long as we take action now. There's a window of time where we can choose to do actions that will slow down climate change. That window is closing. We have to take action now\u2026 if you don't have hope, you give up. You become apathetic, you do nothing.\" In 1991, Goodall founded the Roots & Shoots programme, an organisation with local chapters in more than 140 countries,  including New Zealand . Many of the chapters operate through schools and educational institutions, encouraging youth from preschool to university to work on environmental and humanitarian issues in their communities. She says engaging with young people is crucial. \"We have to reach out to the young people, it's their world that we've trashed, we have to reach out to business, corporations. We have to reach out to governments. We have to reach out to every [Tom], Dick and Harry on the planet and help people understand that what you do matters.\" On Tuesday (NZ time), 18-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg made headlines after  she joined a protest  outside the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow. Delegates from more than 200 countries are attending the 12-day summit, which aims to accelerate action towards the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  World leaders, environmental experts and activists alike  have taken the stage to address the worsening climate crisis, including the likes of US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Thunberg, who  inspired a global youth movement  with her school strikes against climate change in 2018, is not scheduled to speak. Instead, the activist took part in one of the many protests held across Glasgow on Monday (local time), telling young demonstrators from\u00a0'Fridays for Future' \u00a0that the politicians attending the summit are merely  \"pretending to take our future seriously\" .\u00a0 \"This COP26 is so far just like the previous COPs and that has led us nowhere. They have led us nowhere,\" she told the activists.\u00a0 \"Inside COP there are just politicians and people in power pretending to take our future seriously, pretending to take the present seriously of the people who are being affected already today by the climate crisis. \"Change is not going to come from inside there. That is not leadership - this is leadership.\" When asked if world leaders are the people we need to be holding accountable for reversing the effects of climate change, Goodall said it depends on the country. \"I think in New Zealand, you have good leadership,\" she said. \"Other countries, the leadership is trash, quite honestly. So, it depends.\" The inability of major powers so far to agree more broadly on rapid reductions in the use of fossil fuels, the main cause of manmade global warming, has upset poorer developing nations likely to suffer its worst effects. On Tuesday (local time), leaders at COP26 pledged to stop deforestation by the end of the decade and  slash emissions of methane , a potent greenhouse gas, to help slow climate change. Nearly 90 countries have now joined a US and EU-led effort to reduce methane emissions 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, a senior Biden administration official said ahead of the formal announcement on Tuesday. Among the signatories announced on Tuesday is Brazil - one of the five biggest emitters of methane, which is generated in cows' digestive systems, in landfill wast,\u00a0 and in oil and gas production. Three others - China, Russia and India - have not signed up, while Australia has said it will not back the pledge. The COP26 summit is aiming to keep alive a receding target of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avert\u00a0 greater damage from the intensified heatwaves, droughts, storms, floods and coastal damage that climate change is already causing.\u00a0Under the agreement, 12 countries pledged to provide $12 billion of public funding between 2021 and 2025 for developing countries to restore degraded land and tackle wildfires. Overall, Goodall says the onus is on everyone to do their bit to combat climate change. Everyone needs to believe that the actions they are taking, no matter how small, are helping the fight against the crisis -\u00a0 and if everyone makes small changes, it adds up to a sizable difference.\u00a0 \n \"The main message is every individual, every one of us, makes an impact on the planet every single day. We can choose what sort of impact we make,\" she said. \"Although you may think that what you do in a day doesn't make any difference, it's not just you. People are understanding that we can't go on with business as usual.\"", "headline": "Climate change: Jane Goodall says window of time to slow climate change is closing, but people can't give up hope", "article_name": "climate-change-jane-goodall-says-window-of-time-to-slow-climate-change-is-closing-but-people-can-t-give-up-hope", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2021/11/climate-change-jane-goodall-says-window-of-time-to-slow-climate-change-is-closing-but-people-can-t-give-up-hope.html", "date_published": "2021-11-03 11:10:41", "article_length": 6533, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:38.408220"}

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images World leaders who  gathered for the G7 summit  last week are being accused of hypocrisy after  an air show  and a number of social events were held throughout the three-day convention - despite the main topics of discussion being climate change and COVID-19 recovery. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. From June 11 to June 13, the leaders of the G7 nations - Justin Trudeau, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Mario Draghi, Yoshihide Suga, Boris Johnson and Joe Biden respectively - gathered in Cornwall, a county in southwestern England, for a series of face-to-face meetings.\u00a0 During the summit, the G7 leaders met to discuss current issues of international significance. This year, the primary topic of conversation was COVID-19 recovery, including the need for a stronger global health system that will provide protection against future pandemics.  Combating climate change was another major focus.\u00a0On Sunday (local time), the leaders  renewed an overdue spending pledge  to raise US$100 billion a year to help developing countries cut carbon emissions and cope with the impacts of global warming. The seven nations also agreed to  raise their contributions to meet the climate finance target  - funding aimed at cutting emissions, reducing greenhouse gases, and strengthening both human and ecological systems against the negative impacts of climate change.\u00a0 In an announcement, the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to \"jointly mobilise US$100 billion per year from public and private sources, through to 2025\".\u00a0 They also backed the Biden administration's commitment to  shifting developing countries away from coal , the burning of which is one of the biggest contributors to global warming. However, the seven leaders have been  labelled as hypocrites  in response to a number of activities throughout the three-day event, including an air show and outdoor, social gatherings as Britain battles ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.\u00a0 On Saturday (local time), the British Royal Air Force's Red Arrows  flew in formation \u00a0for the leaders' entertainment , spraying red, white and blue smoke over Cornwall. The air show was followed by a barbecue on Cornwall's Carbis Bay Beach. Critics of the summit have been vocal about the discrepancies on social media, with many pointing out the particular disparity between  the leaders' climate change concerns and their carbon footprints . \n One post widely circulated on Facebook highlighted the irony of international leaders convening in Cornwall - via air travel - and enjoying an air show at a summit held to discuss their commitment to combating climate change. The seven nations produce more carbon emissions per capita than the global average. According to carbon emission data, people living in G7 countries emit almost double the amount of CO2 each year compared to an average person elsewhere in the world. The average person in the US and Canada will emit 16 and 15.4 tonnes of CO2 every year respectively. People in Japan emit 8.7t, with 8.4t in Germany, 5.6t in Italy, 5.5t in the UK and 5t in France. Meanwhile, an average person's annual emissions typically sit at 4.7t. Speaking to reporters as the summit concluded, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged that G7 countries account for 20 percent of global carbon emissions. \n \"We were clear this weekend that action has to start with us,\" he said. \"And while it's fantastic that every one of the G7 countries has pledged to wipe out our contributions to climate change, we need to make sure we're achieving that as fast as we can and helping developing countries at the same time.\" After flying to Cornwall's Carbis Bay on a private jet on Wednesday, Johnson announced on Twitter he would challenge his fellow leaders to discuss how to build back \"better, fairer and greener\" at the summit. Critics called on Johnson to lead by example and wondered why he didn't take the train to Cornwall. One critic questioned why - especially amid the ongoing pandemic - the leaders had not held the summit virtually via Zoom or conference call, particularly with climate change being a major talking point. \n Earlier this month, British housing minister Robert Jenrick said that  it was right that the G7 meeting should take place in-person  and there would be precautions in place to keep it 'COVID-safe'. He argued it was \"important\" the international leaders meet in-person to discuss the issues of the day. \"Proper precautions are being put in place to make sure that those people who do come are being tested regularly and so on but of course these things are kept under review,\" Jenrick told  Times Radio. Air travel accounts for around 2.5 percent of global CO2 emissions - the principal greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. The broader aviation industry also generates additional emissions through the processing and transportation of aviation fuel and the manufacture and maintenance of planes, airports and support vehicles, which all create extra carbon dioxide. The leaders had gathered with invited guests at Carbis Bay Beach ahead of a barbecue dinner on Saturday - another point of controversy. Pictures of the leaders enjoying the barbecue on the sands of Carbis Bay sparked outrage after it emerged that restrictions in Britain would likely be extended due to concerns around the fast-spreading Delta variant. And on Monday, Johnson confirmed that 'Freedom Day' - the end of Britain's remaining coronavirus restrictions - would be delayed by four weeks from June 21 until July 19. He said the decision will save thousands of lives due to the country's rising case numbers. As part of 'Freedom Day', the government had planned to lift restrictions on weddings. The ceremonies, which are currently capped at 30 guests, have either been cancelled or highly limited since March 2020.\u00a0 Pictures of the world leaders gathering together outdoors - without observing social distancing -  prompted anger from the wedding industry  as the field is once again left in limbo. Sarah Haywood, a wedding planner and spokesperson for The UK Weddings Taskforce, says the scenes from the summit would breach the restrictions in any other setting. \"They're doing things that would not be allowed at a wedding, the hypocrisy!\" she told  The Telegraph . The Taskforce estimates 50,000 nuptials planned in the four weeks from June 21 could be cancelled if restrictions remain in place. It calculated the industry would lose \u00a3325 million for every week that weddings without restrictions fail to go ahead.\u00a0 10 Downing St, the official office of the UK Prime Minister, denied the beachside barbecue breached Britain's current restrictions, which require all outdoor gatherings to be capped at 30 attendees.\u00a0", "headline": "G7 summit: World leaders accused of hypocrisy over carbon emissions and socialising in COVID-ravaged Britain", "article_name": "g7-summit-world-leaders-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-carbon-emissions-and-socialising-in-covid-ravaged-britain", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2021/06/g7-summit-world-leaders-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-carbon-emissions-and-socialising-in-covid-ravaged-britain.html", "date_published": "2021-06-15 14:52:20", "article_length": 6972, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:38.700529"}

The biggest change in temperatures will be recorded in Ljubljana, Slovenia (up 3.53C), followed by North American cities Cincinnati, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, Montreal, Nashville and Ottawa (all up more than 3C), as well as Jerusalem in Israel, Stockholm in Sweden and Hungary's Budapest.\u00a0 The biggest shifts in climate type will be experienced in Nairobi, Kenya (from 'temperate humid warm summer' to 'tropical savanna wet summer'), Seoul in South Korea, Chicago in the US, Toronto in Canada and Beijing, China.\u00a0 Taking all the measures into account however, the biggest impacts will be felt in Bangkok, the researchers say, largely thanks to extreme sea-level rises.  Analysis by Climate Central last year  found a typical once-a-year flood, by 2050, will be high enough to submerge most of the city, which has a population of 8.3 million.\u00a0 Coming in second is nearby Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, followed by the Netherlands' Amsterdam, China's Shenzhen, Melbourne, Cardiff in Wales, Seoul, Boston in the US, Nairobi and Morocco's Marrakesh.

Credits: Video: The Project; Image: Getty Most people have probably been on a bumpy flight - but every now and then, it can get dangerous. \"Strap in tight,\" - is advice from scientist who says turbulence is about to get worse.\u00a0 The headlines speak for themselves. Last week, an Air Canada \"passenger jet rocked by sudden and severe turbulence\" left 35 people injured, ABC reports. \n \"You just watched everybody's head in the plane just hit the roof, like a jack in a box,\" one passenger said to US media. A flight from Kosovo to Switzerland also made headlines last month after a passenger videoed the extreme turbulence sending belongings and passengers flying throughout the cabin. Closer to home, passengers on a flight from Auckland to Dubai last week described the sudden violent shaking of the plane, causing heads to hit the ceiling.\u00a0 \"Passengers are up in the air, face first. Next thing I know, a guy crawls over. He's like, 'why are you covered in blood?'\" Emirates passenger Abby Milner told The Project. So why is turbulence so sudden and unexpected - surely pilots should be able to avoid it? Paul Williams, an atmospheric science professor, told The Project turbulence can often sneak up on unsuspecting passenger jets. \"[Some encounters are examples of] clear air turbulence... are completely invisible. Not to be seen out of a cockpit window, literally out of the blue,\" Williams says. The increasing prevalence of violent turbulence in the news may not be a coincidence. \"Less than one percent of the atmosphere at 35,000 feet has moderately strong turbulence in it,\" says Williams. \"Of course, we think climate change is going to cause it a lot stronger and a lot more frequent in the future.\" Williams believes some parts of the world will see three times the current amount of turbulence within a lifetime. Air New Zealand says following instructions while flying ensures your best chances of withholding any sudden jolts which aeroplanes are used to.\u00a0 \"The aircraft has been designed to withstand the turbulence. Putting your seatbelt on, even when the sign is off, is a really smart thing to do,\" Captain Hugh Pearce, deputy chief pilot at Air New Zealand, told The Project. Unfortunately, New Zealand is particularly vulnerable to increased turbulence. \"The expectation is for our jet streams to change, and the way the wind moves around the earth to change. It could increase the turbulence we experience in the air,\" says meteorologist Ben Noll. \"We are susceptible to turbulence because we have two jet streams around us. Converging arrows indicate an area where we might see turbulence, sometimes even clear air turbulence where there are quickly changing wind directions,\" Noll explains. To summarise, climate change is seemingly set to impact the frequency and intensity of turbulence and invisible turbulence. For the feeble flyer, perhaps embracing the 'staycation' is a good idea. \"We have seen serious injuries related to turbulence increase. As jet streams are expected to change overtime - that number may continue to rise,\" says Noll. So buckle up, and get ready for a bumpy ride.

Ocean swimmers across the North Island have been sharing their itchy experiences on social media. Stings and bites can be caused by a few sea creatures, but the biggest culprits are sea lice and jellyfish. Last week when Papamoa based mum of three Ashley Cosford packed up the car and took the kids to the Motiti reserve beach, she was met some painful company. \"That night when we got home the kids were just absolutely riddled with bites.\" She rushed to the pharmacy to try and get anything that would soothe the itchy bumps that had formed on her children's skin, but they were sold out. The pharmacist told her it was either caused by jellyfish or sea lice. \"The kids are just aggravated, they were so itchy, my daughter, the poor thing, it was all over her bum, the worst, and my son, he even had some bites that were blistered.\" They eventually found an antihistamine cream but nearly a week later, her six-year-old daughter still has the red bumps. University of Auckland marine scientist Andrew Jeffs said the hotter temperatures may be causing increased marine activity. \"New Zealand is having a pretty unusual summer with much warmer temperatures than normal, probably due to climate change effects, so we've seen some quite remarkable changes and different organisms that are turning up on the coastline.\" He said there were a few different sea creatures to look out for when swimming. \"Jellyfish, in particular, are real opportunists and there are things called sea lice, which are like little arthropods or insects of the sea. You can get bitten by those, and they produce a nasty bite as well. They're cold-blooded, so when the water is warmer, they are more active, so there's lots of reports of people being bitten by different things.\" The rash can last up to two weeks and can be treated with calamine lotion, antihistamines and mild steroid creams. Beachgoers can check for jellyfish and sea lice sightings online on Safeswim, which also provides live information on water quality and swimming conditions.

Hall says reaching those targets means radical economic changes which will be forced on us if we don't choose to start adapting now.\u00a0 \"A revolution is inevitable over the next few decades. We're going to be experiencing a societal transformation on the scale of the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago and the industrial revolution a couple of centuries ago.\"\u00a0 Despite his confronting message Hall remains optimistic, stressing that climate despair is counterproductive and decisions made now can mitigate the inevitable disruption. \"It's really a question of how we undertake that revolution and what choices we make in the way that the risks and opportunities are distributed amongst people.\" Hall praised the Government's recently unveiled incentive scheme to get Kiwis into lower-emission vehicles, but he says it's only a step in the right direction.\u00a0 \"I think that's really vital and important... but there's still not enough on that project level - the actual, specific, local changes that we need to make.\"\u00a0 The academic stressed that Government initiatives such as the One Billion Trees Programme and electric vehicle incentives have to be backed up by individual participation. \"This is a collaborative effort that involves central and local government and involves companies and communities that involves iwi, it involves everybody taking making the most of the opportunities that are there.\" Hall also rejects the idea that Kiwis are not prioritising climate change. \"The thing I keep on coming up against is this idea that people don't care about climate change, and I just don't think that's borne out by the evidence.\"\u00a0 He says the real problem often lies in how climate issues are communicated to the public. \"There's a thought that if we just tell people more about climate change and we bombard them with facts then somehow they're all going to rationally pick up tools and change the world. \"What that perspective misses is that people are embedded in very complicated systems of economy and politics... the organisations we work in have a lot of momentum and a lot of inertia, and making these changes is a difficult process.\" Despite the revolutionary tone of his book, Hall doesn't advocate declaring a climate emergency.\u00a0 \"I think that a lot of the calls that we've been seeing recently for a climate emergency are a reflection of a wider crisis of representative democracy that we've seen kick-off around the world.\" Hall says while he understands the frustration of climate activists who feel their governments are moving too slowly, the politics of emergency could end up backfiring.\u00a0 \"The swiftest and most compelling transition is going to be one that brings everybody along with it... it just isn't obvious that working through emergency and and taking hard decisions without people's buy in is going to get us there. \"That way of doing politics necessarily triggers resistance, revolts and perhaps even counter-revolutions.\" Newshub Nation.", "headline": "Climate change revolution is now inevitable but we can still steer it - expert ", "article_name": "climate-change-revolution-is-now-inevitable-but-we-can-still-steer-it-expert", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/shows/2019/07/climate-change-revolution-is-now-inevitable-but-we-can-still-steer-it-expert.html", "date_published": "2019-07-20 13:33:18", "article_length": 3457, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:39.527303"}
{"id": null, "body": "\n By H. Josef Hebert \r\n At a critical time, the uproar over stolen emails suggesting scientists suppressed contrary views about climate change has emboldened sceptics - including congressional Republicans looking to scuttle President Barack Obama's push for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases. The email brouhaha dubbed \"Climategate\" by doubters comes as US delegates to the international climate conference in Copenhagen are trying to convince the world the United States is determined to move aggressively to rein in heat-trapping pollution. To counter the delegates, a group of GOP lawmakers is going to Copenhagen to argue against mandatory greenhouse gas reductions. The climate sceptics gained political momentum when former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Obama should boycott the negotiations in Denmark and \"not be a party to fraudulent scientific practices\" - a clear reference to the purloined emails from computers belonging to scientists at a British climate research centre. Obama is going anyway. Former Vice President Al Gore, the most recognised US voice on climate change, quickly rebutted Palin and accused the climate deniers in an interview with CNN of \"taking things out of context and misrepresenting\" what the emails actually said. On Thursday, more than 1,700 British scientists released a statement saying they continue to have \"the utmost confidence in the observational evidence for global warming and the scientific basis for concluding that it is due primarily to human activities\". That hasn't stopped Senate Republicans. More than two dozen sent a letter to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon demanding that he launch an independent inquiry into the emails. GOP lawmakers say they will raise questions about what they consider a corruption of climate science at the Denmark conference, where delegates from 192 nations are trying to forge a political agreement. It all began when hackers broke into a computer system belonging to a highly respected climate research centre at Britain's University of East Anglia, stole several thousand emails spanning a decade between some of the world's leading climate scientists, and three weeks ago put some of the spiciest ones on the internet. One referred to using a \"trick\" that could be used to \"hide the decline\" of temperatures. Another disparaged the sceptics, and a scientist said \"the last thing I need is news articles claiming to question temperature increases\". Yet another complained about \"getting hassled by a couple of people\" to release temperature data that suggests uncertainties about climate change. \"Don't any of you three tell anybody that the UK has a Freedom of Information Act,\" Phil Jones, the director of climate research unit, wrote in one email. Jones, who temporarily stepped aside as unit director as an investigation into the matter proceeds, has said the comments have been taken out of context and there never was an intent to manipulate data. Opponents of legislation before Congress to cap heat-trapping emissions and cut them as much as 17 percent by 2020 have seized on the email disclosures and are likely to use them not only at the Copenhagen talks, but in the Senate debate of climate change early next year. \"These emails show a pattern of suppression, manipulation and secrecy,\" insisted Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., a longtime climate sceptic who is among a group of GOP lawmakers heading for Copenhagen. \"We now have thousands of emails showing several of the UN's top scientists apparently evading laws requiring transparency, defaming scientists with opposing viewpoints, and manipulating data to fit preconceived opinions,\" declared Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., another leading climate sceptic in Congress, also going to Copenhagen. Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Centre on Global Climate Change, said she's not surprised by the recent email uproar. \"The closer you get to actually doing something about this problem the more shrill and the more dogmatic the sceptics become because they are trying their hardest to stand in front of a train essentially,\" said Claussen. Earlier this week, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson announced that the agency had concluded, based on science, that greenhouse gases are public health threat and should be regulated. \"The vast body of evidence not only remains unassailable, it has grown even stronger,\" she said. Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and the co-author of the house-passed legislation, said the hacked e-mails scandal was being perpetuated by a \"paid-for\" coalition of deniers who are using it to distract from the action the US and world should be taking. \"These small number of deniers are out there still trying to derail something the rest of the world sees as an imperative for action,\" Markey said.

Leading climate scientists say the Earth could be about to suffer its hottest average temperatures in 1.2 million years - and are warning breaking that threshold could render renewed efforts to reduce human emissions pointless. The authors of the new essay - entitled  Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene  - say there's a risk that \"self-reinforcing feedbacks\" could trigger one another and destabilise the climate, causing it to tip into a \"hothouse\" state. The essay identifies 10 main feedbacks, which include the release of enormous reservoirs of  trapped methane in Siberian permafrost , the  effects of El Ni\u00f1o  and the  melting of the Greenland ice sheet . The essay, which was published in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , suggests those major events could \"push the Earth System toward a planetary threshold that, if crossed, could prevent stabilisation of the climate at intermediate temperature rises\". \"Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene,\" they explained.

Credits: Image - Getty Images; Video - Newshub By Nathan Cooper for The Conversation.\u00a0 Last week's formal recognition by the United Nations Human Rights Council that the  right to a healthy environment  is an essential human right has been heralded as a historic victory for environmental protection and an important step forward for the world's most vulnerable people. It's also significant for coming on the eve of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow next month, billed as the  last best chance  to pledge emissions reductions large enough to head off the worst consequences of global heating and associated ecological harm. On the other hand, UN recognition doesn't make the right to a healthy environment legally binding. No New Zealander can now claim a remedy from the courts because our environment doesn't meet the standard of being clean, healthy and sustainable. So, what does a human right to a healthy environment really mean? Is it largely rhetorical, or will its adoption have tangible consequences both internationally and in Aotearoa New Zealand? Despite its limitations, this new human right is certainly not useless. It's the first time a right to a healthy environment has been explicitly recognised at the global level. The right  obliges states  to protect against environmental harm, to provide equal access to environmental benefits and to ensure a minimum standard of environmental quality for everyone to enjoy. Arguably, this paves the way for better global standards, bolder climate litigation, and even for more equitable sharing of the burdens and benefits of climate change. It also creates a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Climate Change, focused on tackling the effects of climate change on people's enjoyment of their human rights. And it's likely other global and regional bodies, including the UN General Assembly and the Council of Europe, will soon acknowledge the right to a healthy environment. Developments like this would make the right more credible and more visible, transforming it into an effective tool for challenging states and corporations to do more on environmental protection. Overall, the right to a healthy environment reflects a new urgency to push environmental issues back up the international agenda. For example, plans to adopt a \" Global Pact for the Environment \" next year are gaining momentum. Proponents are describing the pact as the most comprehensive international text ever on environmental rights, essential for protecting everyone and everything from the \" triple planetary emergency \" of climate change, pollution and nature loss. Already, in places where a right to a healthy environment is part of domestic law, court decisions are resulting in stronger climate action. The Colombian Supreme Court, for example,  recently decided  that deforestation of the Amazon violated a right to a healthy environment for present and future generations, and required the government to put protections in place. Meanwhile, the Nepalese Supreme Court has held that the government  must take action  on climate change as part of its citizens' constitutional right to a clean environment. From these and many more national examples, we can be confident that recognising a right to a healthy environment will help improve the  implementation of environmental laws , help fill gaps in legislation and support respect for human rights generally. New Zealand's courts and policymakers look to international human rights for  guidance and standards . As recognition of the right to a healthy environment grows internationally, we can expect to see greater reliance on it here. But there is one specific area where I anticipate this right may provide a new approach: climate-change mitigation. When it comes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and New Zealand, the elephant in the room \u2013 or the cow in the field \u2013 is the dairy industry. Between 1990 and 2018 New Zealand's GHG emissions  rose by 24  percent. The increase was driven largely by  methane  from livestock and  nitrous oxide  from fertilisers. Both of these GHGs are many times more potent than carbon dioxide. Continuing to operate with this level of GHG emissions will make it extremely difficult for New Zealand to do its fair share of  climate change mitigation  or meet its  international climate change obligations . The right to a healthy environment, then, could become a new lever for achieving big changes in a small window of time. A rights-based approach to the environment will encourage a conversation around what a healthy environment means and who should enjoy it. It may even provide a fresh vocabulary for discussing broader issues, such as land use, transport and power. As we battle COVID-19 at home, it's tempting to take our eye off the grave environmental challenges ahead. To do that would be a mistake. The full potential of a human right to a healthy environment remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that a healthy environment is essential for human health and well-being \u2013 and that protecting people and protecting nature are always interconnected.

Fighting climate change is no different.\u00a0 On Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its 'life altering' special report 'Global Warming of 1.5degC'. It warns that, unless 'heroic' action is taken in the next 10 years, the damage will be irreversible.\u00a0 We need to be the heroes.\u00a0 We may not have a hostile nation advancing on our border, but we do have the threat of sea level rise licking at our coastline.\u00a0 If we do nothing, the global temperature will rise to two degrees above pre-industrial levels. But if we can limit warming to 1.5degC, then we can reduce sea level rise by 10 centimeters. For low lying communities like South Dunedin and South Brighton in Christchurch, this is crucial to avoid an increased number of devastating floods and storm surges. We may not have fighter jets threatening us with bombs from the sky but we do have excessive carbon emissions. If we want to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, we need to make \"deep reductions\" in methane emissions worldwide. Methane hangs around in the atmosphere, trapping in heat, contributing to the 0.2 degree temperature rise every decade. The Environmental Defense Fund says methane is the principal contributor to man-made climate change. Eighty six percent of New Zealand's methane emissions comes from our farming sector. While it is a huge part of our economy, if we don't make major changes now, it will a non-existent economy for our children and grandchildren.\u00a0 One of the lead authors, and the only New Zealander on the IPCC panel, Bronwyn Hayward told me, \"the Government needs to bite the bullet and tackle the issue of methane emissions with farmers.\" Carbon zero by 2050 is a great target, but it doesn't include methane. Considered a \"short lived gas\", the government proposes \"emissions of methane... must be significantly reduced to sustainable levels\".\u00a0 Based on 2010 levels, the IPCC reports the world needs to cut methane emissions by more than one third. Shouldn't we write that in to legislation as well? Rather than aiming for a flimsy \"significant\". We may not be losing people on the battlefield but we could use 400,000 species if we fail to cap the temperature at 1.5degC. If global warming continues to increase at the current rate, it's predicted to reach 1.5degC between 2030 and 2052. At that temperature, many species are at risk of extinction - but if the global average temperature rises by another half a degree, about 400,000 species could die out. At 1.5degC, coral reefs would decline by 70 to 90 percent, whereas nearly all would be lost with 2C. So what can you do? With knowledge, of course. Figure out where you are going wrong, where you are being wasteful and where your greatest emissions come from. Make small, sustainable changes to your life rather than trying to change too much at once. Use reusable plastic bags, catch a bus to work, introduce meat-free Monday or reduce your plastic consumption with bamboo toothbrushes. Everyone needs to do their part and a good word from you could help change someone's perspective. Think little picture. If we don't change our habits now, holidays in the Pacific could be a thing of the past, you could be clearing up from a wild storm a little more often, and that morning coffee could get a whole lot more expensive.\u00a0 We are fighting for our country, not against our enemies but against ourselves.\u00a0 Shannon Redstall is The AM Show producer and reporter.", "headline": "Opinion: We need to go to war on climate change", "article_name": "opinion-we-need-to-go-to-war-on-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/10/opinion-we-need-to-go-to-war-on-climate-change.html", "date_published": "2018-10-09 18:40:22", "article_length": 3680, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:41.043931"}

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Researchers say too little emphasis has been placed on two of the most effective ways we could be fighting climate change - limiting population growth and social justice. \"Since 1997, there have been more than 200 articles published in Nature and Science on climate mitigation, but just four of those discussed social justice, and only two considered population,\" said William Ripple,\u00a0 professor of ecology at Oregon State University. \"Clearly social justice and population policy are not getting the attention they deserve in the struggle against the climate emergency.\" Dr Ripple and his colleague Christopher Wolf say \"curbing population growth in the context of social justice\" could \"make substantial contributions to climate mitigation and adaptation\". Since 1970, the average  global temperature has risen by 0.8C . In that time the world's population has doubled, and  emissions of carbon dioxide have more than doubled , data from the International Energy Agency shows.\u00a0 World Bank figures back that up , showing we're emitting slightly more per capita than a half-century ago. \"More than 11,000 scientists from 153 countries have come together to warn that if we continue with business as usual, the result will be untold human suffering from climate change,\" said Dr Ripple. The more people there are on the planet, the worse it is for the climate, the researchers argue in a new paper,  published this week in the journal\u00a0 Sustainability Science .\u00a0 \"There are strong links between high rates of population growth and ecosystem impacts in developing countries connected to water and food security,\" said Dr Wolf.\u00a0 \"Given the challenges of food and water security, effective population policies can support achieving both social justice and climate adaptation, particularly when you consider the current and projected uneven geographical distribution of the impacts of climate change.\" They acknowledge population control has earned a bad reputation, \"partly due to forced sterilization campaigns and China's one-child policy\". But they reckon if done right, it can not only fight climate change but promote \"human rights, equity and social justice\" - such as through education for young women, ending child marriage and increasing the availability of family planning services.\u00a0 \"Three examples of countries in which improved education for girls and young women may have contributed to significant fertility rate declines are Ethiopia, Indonesia and Kenya,\" Dr Ripple said.\u00a0 \"Among those nations, specific education reforms included instituting classes in local languages, increasing budgets for education and removing fees for attending school. Ethiopia also implemented a school lunch program, large-scale school construction took place in Indonesia, and primary school was lengthened by one year in Kenya.\" But who's going to pay for it? The researchers say rich countries should, considering they're the ones responsible for most of the climate damage to date. Rich countries tend to have lower birth rates already, some below the rate of replacement, so they have to actually cut consumption, rather than just produce fewer offspring.\u00a0 \"It's not a balanced approach to focus on fertility rates without remembering that wealthy governments, corporations and individuals have been the primary contributors to carbon dioxide emissions and the main beneficiaries of fossil fuel consumption,\" said Dr Wolf. \"Overconsumption by the wealthy must be addressed immediately, for example through policies like eco-taxes such as carbon pricing,\" said Dr Ripple. \"Reducing fertility rates alone is clearly not enough. The middle class and rich must be responsible for most of the needed reduction in emissions.\" The long-term goal should not just be to reduce emissions but aim for \"convergence\" - equalising emissions output per capita between nations.\u00a0 \"Social justice and the climate emergency demand that equitable population policies be prioritized in parallel with strategies involving energy, food, nature, short-lived pollutants and the economy,\" said Dr Ripple. \"With feedback loops, tipping points and potential climate catastrophe looming, we have to be taking steps in all of those areas and not ignoring any of them.\" \u00a0", "headline": "Population control and 'social justice' key to fight climate change - scientists", "article_name": "population-control-and-social-justice-key-to-fight-climate-change-scientists", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2021/04/population-control-and-social-justice-key-to-fight-climate-change-scientists.html", "date_published": "2021-04-30 13:57:44", "article_length": 4376, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:41.241391"}

Melting glaciers, rising sea levels and species extinction are just some of the problems expected to worsen as the world moves closer to what scientists call a \" tipping point \". But now, there is another thing to add to the list of climate-change related problems: premature births. According to a new study published in Nature Climate Change, hot temperatures may lead to babies being born earlier, meaning the number of babies born prematurely could rise in coming years. Researchers looked at a sample of 56 million live births in the United States to see what impact hotter weather had on when babies are born. They found that between 1969 and 1988 extreme heat caused an estimated 25,000 babies to be born earlier than they otherwise would have been. On average the babies were born 6.1 days earlier, though in some cases babies came out of the womb two weeks earlier, researchers Alan \u00ad\u00adBarreca and Jessamyn Schalle said. Barreca and Schalle used estimated shifts in daily birth rates from counties across the United States to calculate the total number of lost days of gestation. On days with a maximum temperature above 32.2C, the birth rates increase by 5 percent, the authors found.\u00a0 They also referred to existing studies that show extreme heat in the second and third trimester led to lower birth rates. The authors concluded that based on projections of climate change, an additional 250,000 gestational days could be lost annually by the end of the century. \"While we posit climate change will cause gestational losses, the exact magnitude of the future costs is highly uncertain - households may adapt as expectations about the frequency of hot weather events increase, which could mitigate impacts on infant health,\" the authors wrote. The study comes after scientists last week warned the planet was edging dangerously close to a \"tipping point\", which once crossed would lead Earth past the point of no return. \"The stability and resilience of our planet is in peril,\" the authors of that report concluded.", "headline": "As global temperatures rise so may the number of premature births - study", "article_name": "as-global-temperatures-rise-so-may-the-number-of-premature-births-study", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/lifestyle/2019/12/as-global-temperatures-rise-so-may-the-number-of-premature-births-study.html", "date_published": "2019-12-03 11:21:30", "article_length": 2142, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:41.721667"}

Researchers found the livestock sector emits one third of all human-induced nitrogen pollution, mainly from livestock effluent, synthetic nitrogen fertiliser use and the international transport of livestock commodities. Greenpeace agriculture campaigner Gen Toop says the study shows the country needs to move more into regenerative agricultural practices. \"Any political party serious about tackling the climate crisis and cleaning up our rivers needs to commit to ending synthetic fertiliser use and invest in moving the country into more plant-based regenerative farming,\" Toop said on Friday.

The increase in extreme sea [levels] may pose a potential for coastal flooding.\" The study shows the years between now and 2100 will see an increased flood risk for 48 percent of the world's land area, with 225 million people likely to be threatened by extreme sea level rise. The economic risk posed by coastal floods totals a barely conceivable US$14.2 trillion (NZ$21.43 trillion) - one-fifth of the world's gross domestic product (GDP) - based on a climate scenario where global carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise at the same rate. \"A warming climate is driving sea-level rise because water expands as it warms, and glaciers are melting. Climate change is also increasing the frequency of extreme seas, which will further increase the risk of flooding,\" Kirezci said. \"What the data and our model is saying is that compared with now, what we see as a one-in-100-year extreme flood event will be 10 times more frequent because of climate change.\u201d When asked about the specific threat to New Zealand, Kirezci said it required further investigation - but Prof Young said the research acts as a \"wake-up call\" for governments across the globe. \"This is critical research from a policy point of view because it provides politicians with a credible estimate of the risks and costs we are facing, and a basis for taking action,\" he said. Prof Young believes the study's results should \"inform policy at a global and local government-level\", enabling more flood defences to be built to safeguard coastal life and infrastructure. \"Our research shows that large parts of communities residing in low-lying coastal areas are at risk of being devastated so we need urgent action,\" Kirezci added. \"Vulnerable areas need to start building coastal defences, we need to increase our preparedness, and we need to be following strategies to mitigate climate change.\" However, Kirezci admits any positive climate action is likely to be too little, too late. \"There's more research required,\" she told Newshub. \"But still, sea level rises are already happening and will continue to happen no matter what we do.\"", "headline": "Map shows New Zealand likely to get 'extreme sea levels' due to climate change, bringing more coastal floods", "article_name": "map-shows-new-zealand-likely-to-get-extreme-sea-levels-due-to-climate-change-bringing-more-coastal-floods", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/08/map-shows-new-zealand-likely-to-get-extreme-sea-levels-due-to-climate-change-bringing-more-coastal-floods.html", "date_published": "2020-08-03 16:04:03", "article_length": 3400, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:42.913855"}

If every country did as much as New Zealand to combat climate change, the world would fail to meet its Paris Agreement targets, according to a new report. Climate Action Tracker, a non-profit which provides \"independent scientific analysis that tracks government climate action\",  ranked New Zealand's efforts as \"insufficient\",  despite the Zero Carbon Act, which aims to make New Zealand carbon-neutral by 2050. \"The Zero Carbon Act does not introduce any policies to actually cut emissions but rather sets a framework,\" Climate Action Tracker said earlier this week, criticising its weaker targets for other greenhouse gases like methane and ongoing subsidies for the \"biggest industrial polluters\" like Rio Tinto. \"While the Zero-Carbon Act recently adopted strengthens its former 2050 target (halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050), excluding such a substantial share of emissions from the net zero goal lowers its ambition.\" In addition to going soft on agriculture emissions, the report notes New Zealand also has \"one of the oldest passenger vehicle fleets in the developed world\", many of which don't have to meet newer emissions standards because of their age, and the Government backed down on plans to make its entire fleet electric by mid-2025.\u00a0 Only two countries analysed in the report  are meeting their Paris obligations to keep warming below 1.5C - Morocco and The Gambia. No countries are considered a role model. At the other end,  countries whose actions are \"critically insufficient\"  and would result in warming above 4C this century include the US - which is in the process of pulling out of the Paris Agreement altogether - oil-rich Russia and Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Ukraine.\u00a0 Countries whose efforts are highly insufficient include China, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Chile, Argentina, Indonesia and UAE. New Zealand will join them if further action isn't taken, Climate Action Tracker says. \"New Zealand's current policies are not consistent with holding warming to below 2C, let alone limiting it to 1.5C as required under the Paris Agreement, and are instead consistent with warming between 3C and 4C.\" In Climate Action Tracker's first report, published in 2012, New Zealand was rated 'inadequate', where it remained until 2017 when the wording was changed to 'insufficient', where it was remained.\u00a0 Scientists have long warned if the world keeps warming, to expect sea level rises, droughts and increasingly erratic weather. In recent years threats of mass extinction and sea level rises that would submerge most seaside cities have entered the conversation, as well as feedback loops which could see temperatures spiral rapidly out-of-control beyond scientists' expectations. A study in August found last time temperatures were 2C to 3C warmer than today,  the seas were 16m higher.\u00a0 New research published just this week found climate scientists' predictions as far back as the 1970s, before today's powerful computers were available, have been accurate. \"How much warming we are having today is pretty much right on where models have predicted,\" lead author Zeke Hausfather of the University of California  told magazine  Science .\u00a0 Where models from the 20th century got the level of warming slightly wrong, the research found, it was usually because pollution habits changed in ways scientists didn't predict. Once real-world pollution data was entered into the primitive models, they were largely accurate.\u00a0 \"The fact that early climate models got future temperatures broadly right is strong evidence that longer-term climate changes are predictable,\" Hausfather\u00a0  told CBS News , \"and that they have been driven by increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in recent decades.\" His research was  published this week in journal  Geophysical Research Letters .", "headline": "World doomed to 3C temperature rise if everyone copied New Zealand - report", "article_name": "world-doomed-to-3c-temperature-rise-if-everyone-copied-new-zealand-report", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/12/world-doomed-to-3c-temperature-rise-if-everyone-copied-new-zealand-report.html", "date_published": "2019-12-06 11:01:16", "article_length": 4001, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:43.301320"}
{"id": null, "body": "\n Documents released Friday by the Nixon Presidential Library show members of US President Richard Nixon's inner circle discussing the possibilities of global warming more than 40 years ago. Adviser Daniel Patrick Moynihan, notable as a Democrat in the administration, urged the administration to initiate a worldwide system of monitoring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, decades before the issue of global warming came to the public's attention. There is widespread agreement that carbon dioxide content will rise 25 percent by 2000, Moynihan wrote in a September 1969 memo. \"This could increase the average temperature near the earth's surface by 7degF,\" he wrote. \"This in turn could raise the level of the sea by 10 feet. Goodbye New York. Goodbye Washington, for that matter.\" Moynihan was Nixon's counsellor for urban affairs from January 1969 - when Nixon began his presidency - to December 1970. He later served as the US ambassador to the United Nations before New   York voters elected him to the Senate. Moynihan received a response in a January 26, 1970 memo from Hubert Heffner, deputy director of the administration's Office of Science and Technology. Heffner acknowledged that atmospheric temperature rise was an issue that should be looked at. \"The more I get into this, the more I find two classes of doom-sayers, with, of course, the silent majority in between,\" he wrote. \"One group says we will turn into snow-tripping mastodons because of the atmospheric dust and the other says we will have to grow gills to survive the increased ocean level due to the temperature rise.\" Heffner wrote that he would ask the Environmental Science Services Administration to look further into the issue. Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency and had an interest in the environment. In one memo, Moynihan noted his approval of the first Earth Day, to be held April 22, 1970. \"Clearly this is an opportunity to get the President usefully and positively involved with a large student movement,\" he wrote to John Ehrlichman, Nixon's adviser on domestic affairs. Moynihan's memo was among 100,000 documents released Friday. The documents also include about 5,000 pages of now unclassified national security records on the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, correspondence between Nixon and then-British Prime Minister Edward Heath and back-channel Soviet-Israeli relations.

The island in the Hauraki Gulf is completely off the electrical grid, so locals rely on solar power for a large part of their electricity.

A new interactive map shows which parts of the world have been hardest-hit by climate change, and which will bear the brunt over the next half-century. ClimateEx  was put together by geology professor Tomsz Stepinski and researcher Pawel Netzel, both of the University of Cincinnati. It uses five decades' worth of weather and climate data collected from 50,000 weather stations around the Earth, including New Zealand. It shows not just how the climate has changed in that time, but also what's expected to happen by the year 2070, based on current trends. The data includes not just temperatures, but rainfall, which Prof Stepinski says is often forgotten about when it comes to climate change. \"Climate has many components, including precipitation. People often consider temperature and precipitation separately, but our mathematical model includes both.\" More heat in the atmosphere means more moisture and more energy - put those together and you have an increased likelihood of hurricanes and rainfall, with more variability in local weather from day to day.\u00a0 Setting the map to show the expected change between 2000 and 2070, it shows Central America and the northern part of South America are at risk of increased heat and rainfall, as are Papua New Guinea, southeastern China, the west coast of the US and most importantly for sea level change, Greenland and the Arctic. \n In New Zealand, the biggest changes are expected north of Whangarei, from Coromandel through the Bay of Plenty to the East Cape, the central North Island and Wairarapa. The west coast of Waikato is also expected to get hotter and wetter, as well as the northern tip of the South Island. \"If you were looking at climate change at a scale of a million years, you wouldn't worry too much,\" Stepinski said. \"But if you see dramatic changes on the order of a few decades, it's a big problem. Personally I'm not happy there are people who seem to disregard this as not much of a problem. It is a problem.\" The map can also be used to see what cities have similar climates, now and in the future. \"ClimateEx enables an easy search for locations where climate change may lead to the occurrence of such extreme phenomena in the future,\" says Prof Stepinski. \"The user simply indicates the location where tornadoes are presently frequent and ClimateEx finds all locations where in 50 years the climate will be conducive to tornadoes.\" Clicking on Auckland shows its weather bears a resemblance to that of Wales and western Ireland, the southwest of France, Uruguay and even Croatia. This makes it a also useful tool for people planning to migrate cities, says Prof Stepinski. \"It is easy to get answers to questions such as where in the world do we have a climate similar to Houston's?

{"id": null, "body": "\n By Dan Satherley Oxfam is to launch a new campaign on June 1, aimed at fixing the world's \"broken\" food system. Called GROW, it will bring together such issues as climate change, the controversy surrounding biofuels, ill-advised aid donations and the \"monstrous injustice\" of climate change. Oxfam hopes it will get people talking about the issues surrounding food and the growing gap between the world's haves and have-nots. \"People are hungry because their land has been stolen, people are hungry because of climate change, people are hungry because their plants\u00a0have been patented,\" says Oxfam campaigns director John Stansfield.  Speaking at the Festival for the Planet in Auckland on the weekend, Mr Stansfield said climate change is one of the biggest problems the world had ever faced \u2013 especially for poor, vulnerable island nations. \"The developing nations of the\u00a0Pacific did not cause climate change,\" he told the packed Auckland Town Hall.  \"None of the enormous profits that have been generated from the burning of fossil fuels have washed\u00a0up on their shores, and yet our Pacific neighbours are the first to be affected by climate change.\" Problems small Pacific nations face as a result of climate change include not just rising sea levels, but unstable weather conditions, making harvests unreliable. Rev Suamalie Naisali of the  Reformed Christian Church of Tuvalu drove the point home, telling the crowd his entire nation is at risk. Tuvalu , a tiny archipelago nation north of New Zealand, is only 4m above sea level at its highest point.  \"My people have been threatened by climate change and been\u00a0forced to relocate and displaced,\" says Rev Naisali. \"And for what? For security and survival.\" He told the crowd he would like to coin a new word, \"envirogrant\", a portmanteau of \"environmental immigrant\".  \"We are not refugees, because we are not qualified under the US convention and protocols of\u00a0refugees from the environment, but we are immigrants that made better choices for us and for our children,\" says Rev Naisali. As the world's climate warms, local weather patterns experience growing instability, making it more difficult to predict conditions in advance. \"Some of the big crop failures recently have been directly attributable to\u00a0fluctuations in climate that weren't predicted,\" Mr Stansfield told 3 News.  Instability in the food supply causes prices to rise and fall erratically, worsening the problem for the world's poorer nations.  \"Price fluctuations have excited the market, who crashed the other toys they had, so there's a great deal now of speculation on food crops,\" says Mr Stansfield.  The growing popularity of cleaner-burning and renewable biofuels is also a threat, as more and more crops are being used for fuel instead of food.  \"It certainly is contributing to the problem, and where it's predominantly contributing is that there are massive, ill-targeted\u00a0subsidies into biofuels,\" says Mr Stansfield. \"In the US, 40 percent of all corn is now going straight to the petrol tank. Now what's that's done is create a very\u00a0cast-iron link between food and oil, so if the price of oil goes up, kiss your cornies goodbye. \"There is a place for biofuel, but we have to be aware there is risk that it could cause hunger.\" Reinvesting in agriculture in developing nations, instead of giving food directly, would help alleviate the problem.   \"People are hungry because rich nations have dumped food in\u00a0their countries and crushed their own existing food industries,\" says Mr Stansfield. \"The proportion of the world's aid money that goes into agriculture is absolutely tiny.\" The relationships between climate change, the food business and the politics of aid are complex, but Mr Stansfield says the bigger picture is actually quite simple. \"If you take one step back, you say hang on, it's much more basic than this,\" says Mr Stansfield. \"There's a group of people over in one part and they're all fat\u00a0and obese, they've got heart disease, they've got far too much food.  \"And a group of people over here, they're all skinny, they've got\u00a0malnutrition, and they're the ones actually producing the food. \"And in the middle is this mountain of food going to waste, rotting and\u00a0being thrown away, and a billion people in the world go to bed hungry every night when there is enough food. \"The system of governance of food is broken.\" Oxfam hopes the campaign will put pressure on the Government to take climate change seriously.  \"Clearly the Government isn't doing enough. Clearly it hasn't taken climate change leadership in the nation, so what we really need is the nation\u00a0to lead the Government.\u00a0 \"We are not leading like we should, and we are certainly not standing up as we should with our brothers and sisters in the\u00a0Pacific. \"We must all stand with the people of the Pacific against this completely avoidable evil.\" Tuvalu 's Rev Naisali says Oxfam's fears are genuine. \"I tell you, the impact of climate change on food, water\u00a0security, our way of life, our culture, our community, the overall health of our people and the ecological system that we depend on now has\u00a0been threatened. \"If a tsunami comes to Tuvalu, 10 feet above sea level, it will\u00a0demolish a nation, our people, our culture, our language, and that's why I am here.\" Other speakers at the Festival for the Planet included ex-MP Nandor Tanzcos, NASA climatologist James Hansen and ex-NIWA head Jim Salinger, with performances from King Kapisi and Emma Paki. 3 News source: newshub archive", "headline": "Oxfam - climate change a 'monstrous injustice'", "article_name": "oxfam--climate-change-a-monstrous-injustice-2011052611", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/environmentsci/oxfam--climate-change-a-monstrous-injustice-2011052611", "date_published": "1970-01-01 15:12:00", "article_length": 5499, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:44.870085"}

Credits: Video - Newshub Nation; Images - Getty/Scientific Reports We're perhaps between 50 and 60 years too late to prevent catastrophic climate change simply by ceasing emissions,  scientists say . Temperatures will continue to rise for a long time after we reach carbon-zero, new research has found, and the only way to avoid the worst will be to start actively taking carbon out of the atmosphere. But the research has been criticised by Kiwi climate scientists, saying the findings are unrealistic and based on low-complex modelling, rather than state-of-the-art systems. Two Norwegian researchers ran simulations of the global climate between 1850 and 2500, looking at how different levels of greenhouse gas emissions affected temperatures and sea level rises. Under the most likely optimistic scenario - emissions peaking in the 2030s before gradually declining to zero by 2100, by 2500 the seas would be 3m higher and temperatures on average 3C warmer than in 1850. 1850 is when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to skyrocket, thanks to industrialisation. Even if we stopped emissions today, \"global temperatures will still be around 3C warmer and sea levels will rise by around 2.5 metres by 2500\", the modelling showed. \"We have identified a point-of-no-return in our climate model ESCIMO - and that it is already behind us,\" climate scientists Jorgen Randers and Ulrich Goluke  wrote in journal  Scientific Reports . \"In ESCIMO the global temperature keeps rising to 2500 and beyond, irrespective of how fast humanity cuts the emissions of man-made greenhouse gas emissions.\" There are three main drivers of this continued growth in temperatures and sea level rises. The first is a \"cycle of self-sustained melting of the permafrost\". It's already melting, releasing methane - a gas with an even stronger greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide - which causes more temperature rises, and more melting.\u00a0 The second is \"lower surface albedo\" - with less of the Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, less of the sun's energy is reflected back into space. This means it absorbs more, contributing to warming.\u00a0 And the third is water vapour. A warmer atmosphere is a more humid one, and water vapour is also a greenhouse gas.\u00a0 Under the first scenario - cutting emissions to zero by 2100 - the model found temperatures would peak at 2.3C above 1850 around 2075, before declining over the next 75 years. But then something unexpected happens - temperatures start going back up again. \"The surprising fact is that this rise takes place 50 years after man-made emissions have ceased, and after the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been significantly reduced through absorption in oceans and biomass.\" The culprit is the melting permafrost and ice.\u00a0 \"The effect of surface albedo continues on its smooth upward path throughout this period... it has enough momentum to push the climate system back onto a path of rising temperatures, with its secondary effects of raising humidity and permafrost melting, which then in turn help the system become warmer and warmer, even if man-made greenhouse gas emissions are zero.\u00a0 \"A cycle of self-reinforcing processes is established... The process is self-sustaining, at least until all carbon is released from permafrost and all ice is melted.\" Even if emissions are cut to zero right now, the same thing happens - albeit about 75 years later. In other words, we're past the point of no return. The scientists ran further tests to see when we had to act by, and the news wasn't good. \"The answer is that all man-made emissions would have had to be cut to zero sometime between 1960 and 1970 - when global warming was still below 0.5C.\" The temperature now is about 1C higher than it was in 1850, and increasing about 0.2C a decade - at an accelerating rate.\u00a0 To avoid the self-sustaining melting, they calculated 33 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide would need to be removed from the atmosphere from 2020. \"In other words, building 33,000 big carbon capture and storage plants and keep them running forever.\" Worldwide, there are presently only 51 large-scale carbon capture and storage plants either in operation or under construction,  according to a May report from US-based non-profit Resources for the Future. The authors of the latest study admit building 33,000 plants is \"technically feasible but would be hugely expensive\". \"Cheaper opportunities exist to stop self-sustained global warming (through various forms of geo-engineering), but these will have unintended and undesired side effects beyond lowering the temperature.\" While other climate scientists described the study as \"interesting\", the modelling used has been criticised as simplistic. \"Earth system models typically contain hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and require a supercomputer to run on. Even then, a 100-year simulation may still take several months to run,\" said Laura Revell, environmental physicist at the University of Canterbury. Instead they used a low-complexity model that can be run in a matter of seconds. \"Reduced-complexity climate models contain highly simplistic representations of the climate system and how different processes interact with one another. The authors do acknowledge this by inviting other researchers to investigate their findings with complex models.\" James Renwick of the Victoria University School of\u00a0Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences said the findings were at odds with other research, which suggest no further warming once emissions are stopped. \"The results presented in this paper are very implausible and should not be seen as cause for alarm.\"", "headline": "Climate change: We're 60 years too late to stop global warming, sea level rises - study", "article_name": "climate-change-we-re-60-years-too-late-to-stop-global-warming-sea-level-rises-study", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/11/climate-change-we-re-60-years-too-late-to-stop-global-warming-sea-level-rises-study.html", "date_published": "2020-11-13 05:19:06", "article_length": 5741, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:44.986634"}

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Reuters Five million people die every year as a result of abnormal temperatures linked to climate change,  a new study has found. But while that number would be even higher if the planet wasn't warming, scientists say climate change is nothing to celebrate.\u00a0 Scientists at Melbourne's Monash University analysed temperature and mortality data from dozens of countries across the world over the first 20 years of this century, which have seen the rate of warming speed up.\u00a0 The conclusion? More than 9 percent of all deaths around the world can be blamed on the temperature - most of them due to the cold.\u00a0 Cold-related deaths decreased 0.51 percent between 2000 and 2019, and heat deaths rose 0.21 percent - this led to a \"reduction in net mortality due to cold and hot temperatures\", the scientists said.\u00a0 The most deaths due to heat per capita happened in Europe, while sub-Saharan Africa had the worst mortality when it came to the cold.\u00a0 New Zealand and Australia were lumped together in the study, which said between them they experience about 19,000 excess deaths each year due to abnormal temperatures - only about one in seven of those due to excess heat.\u00a0 Overall, most deaths due to abnormal temperatures happen in Asia - 2.6 million each year, 2.4 million of them due to cold.\u00a0 According to NASA , 19 of the world's hottest years since records began  have happened in the past 20 years . Every year in the past decade has been hotter than the 20th century's record-holder, 1998. Global mean temperatures are increasing about 0.26C a decade.\u00a0 \"As each new year is added to the historical record, it becomes one of the top 10 warmest on record at that time, but it is ultimately replaced as the 'top ten' window shifts forward in time,\"  according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Global warming may \"slightly reduce the number of temperature-related deaths, largely because of the lessening in cold-related mortality\" said Prof Yuming Guo, who led the research. But that doesn't mean we should stick with gas-guzzling cars and coal-burning power stations. \n \"In the long run, climate change is expected to increase the mortality burden,\" the study,  published in  The Lancet Planetary Health , said. That's because, Dr Guo says, \"hot-related mortality would be continuing to increase\".\u00a0 In other words, eventually the growing number of deaths attributable to excess heat would surpass those saved.\u00a0", "headline": "Study finds global warming is reducing the number of people dying from the cold, but there's a catch", "article_name": "study-finds-global-warming-is-reducing-the-number-of-people-dying-from-the-cold-but-there-s-a-catch", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2021/07/study-finds-global-warming-is-reducing-the-number-of-people-dying-from-the-cold-but-there-s-a-catch.html", "date_published": "2021-07-08 10:56:31", "article_length": 2551, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:45.266584"}
{"id": null, "body": "Watch: What plans does the Climate Commission have for slashing New Zealand's emissions?   Credits: Newshub We came together as a nation to fight COVID-19 and now our challenge is battling emissions. While a lot of the heavy lifting will be done by central and local governments along with big business, there are lots of changes 'we' can make - alongside changes we will have to adapt to. Aotearoa has a goal to cut our net-emissions by 36 percent by the year 2035 and the Climate Change Commission has just released a blueprint on Monday detailing how to do it.\u00a0 Now we know how we can get there and what changes will be made that will affect our day-to-day lives. Planners Institute Deputy Luke O'Dwyer says there will be \"more of a transition to smaller houses, potentially more apartments, more townhouses.\" New housing will be more efficient, smaller houses mean more people can live closer to shops, parks and work and it's cheaper to heat. Gas won't be allowed in any new builds if the Climate Change Commission's recommendations are adopted by the Government. If a household already has gas and doesn't make the switch, the annual power bill could increase by as much as $150 by 2035, as demand for cleaner energy increases. Petrol could also go up by about 30 cents a litre. But the commission calculates if you trade in your petrol car for an electric one, you'll be $1000 per year better off - if you can afford it in the first place. David Crawford from the Motor Industry Association says electric cars are a costly option.\u00a0 \"Pure electric vehicles are roughly about twice the price of a normal combustion engine vehicle, hybrid vehicles are about 5-10 percent more expensive, and plugged in hybrids are about 10-15 percent more expensive.\" The commission recommends an electric fleet make up 40 percent of our cars by 2035. Sustainability professor Janet Stephenson says the main barrier is that alternative modes of transport aren't up to scratch.\u00a0 \"It is that we don't have very good buses or other public transport or that cycling is really dangerous.\" That's where the report kicks in, allowing us to get the kinds of products and services we need to be able to live and work the way we want to.\u00a0 One in ten of us will work from home and more of us will be walking and cycling, with 15 percent of all trips being made by bike by 2050. We're encouraged to waste less and support the overall kaupapa by looking at investments. Stephenson says it's important to consider whether they support a low-carbon future or are they \"repeating the past?\" You can't talk about climate change without mentioning the 'F' words - farming and forestry.\u00a0 Both sectors have been handed their instructions for the next 15 years and have quickly responded by dubbing them \"challenging\" but \"possible\".\u00a0 However, some scientists are questioning whether the commission has let our biggest emitters off lightly.\u00a0\u00a0 While agriculture makes up a whopping 90 percent of methane emissions, it is a short term gas.\u00a0 When it comes to those that last the longest in our atmosphere, farming is only responsible for 18 percent - it's transport, heat, industry and power that are the biggest emitters.\u00a0\u00a0 Because of this, the commission has set a separate goal for methane emissions, to lower them by 24-47 percent. Dr Tim Mackle from Dairy NZ is happy with the separate target. \"The split gas approach is really important for us, it's great to see the commission acknowledging it as the right way to go.\"\u00a0 Scientist Brownyn Hayward is not so convinced. \"If we are asking people to make big sacrifices in transport, we have to make sure we are asking the same of other sectors, including agriculture.\" For forestry the commission has a target of 300,000 hectares of native bush in the next 14 years.\u00a0\u00a0 The forestry industry is up for the challenge but it is a challenge.\u00a0 Compared to pine - which is currently used to offset our carbon emissions - natives are tough to grow and pricey. \"The Government's policy settings around incentives to plant natives is going to have to be very focussed and in tune with the fact that natives do take significantly more time, effort and resources to establish and maintain,\" says Phil Taylor from the Forestry Association.\u00a0 The Government is due to finalise a plan by the end of the year, based on this report that has been years in the making.", "headline": "Climate Change Commission releases big plan for slashing New Zealand's emissions", "article_name": "climate-change-commission-releases-big-plan-for-slashing-new-zealand-s-emissions", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/02/climate-change-commission-releases-big-plan-for-slashing-new-zealand-s-emissions.html", "date_published": "2021-02-01 19:52:42", "article_length": 4365, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:45.500090"}

She continued: \"Text explaining New Zealand's so-called climate emergency declaration. This is of course nothing unique to any nation.\u00a0#FightFor1Point5.\" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has pledged to  decarbonise the public sector by 2025 , announced a climate emergency in New Zealand on December 2 in recognition of the devastating toll extreme weather will take on New Zealand, as well as the alarming loss of species. The Government's plan to decarbonise the public sector by 2025 is a step towards its goal of a carbon-neutral New Zealand by 2050.\u00a0The Government has also banned new offshore oil and gas exploration and established the Climate Change Commission, which will advise governments on how to meet targets set in the Zero Carbon Act passed in 2019.\u00a0 As well as a goal of zero net carbon emissions by 2050, the Government has also set a target of reducing methane emissions by between 24 and 47 percent by the same year.\u00a0 However, New Zealand has seen some of the\u00a0 biggest increases in greenhouse gases . Since 1990, greenhouse gas emissions have risen by nearly 60 percent, and gross emissions have increased by 24 percent. In 2018, nearly half of the country's gross emissions came from agriculture - 47.8 percent - followed by energy - mostly transport - at 40.5 percent. The National Party opposed the declaration, calling it \"virtue signalling\". \"Declaring a climate emergency is nothing but virtue signalling,\" National's climate change spokesperson Stuart Smith said in Parliament. \"Symbolic gestures just don't cut it.\" In comparison, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pledging to reduce the country's emissions by 68 percent by 2030, and to stop funding international fossil fuel projects. On Saturday night,  New Zealand was noticeably absent  from the international Climate Ambition Summit 2020, hosted by the United Nations, France and the UK.\u00a0 More than 80 world leaders and environmentalists took part in the virtual conference - however, Ardern did not speak at the summit. The Prime Minister's absence sparked suggestions that New Zealand's poor record put the country out of favour with better-performing nations. \"This summit was really for countries to make some quite significant announcements. In the time we had available to us, we felt we couldn't do it justice,\"\u00a0Climate Change Minister James Shaw told reporters.

Speech notes from Ms Ardern's address to the UN Secretary-General's High Level Dialogue on Climate Change, also on Thursday morning, quote her calling for world leaders to \"move off extreme positions\". \"Political leaders may have thought that the  Paris Agreement's adoption in 2016  meant 'job done',\" the text of her speech says. \"But the Agreement only gives us the raw ingredients for climate action; the recipe - the detailed instructions - now have to be decided in Katowice.\" The Katowice Climate Change Conference is aimed at ensuring the full implementation of the Paris Agreement, but Ms Ardern says the world isn't ready for it. \"There are now only a few months until Katowice and negotiators are frankly not ready. It is time for political leaders to send a crystal clear message that negotiation of the rulebook needs to be successfully concluded in December,\" the text of her UN speech reads. \"It is up to leaders - right now - to direct negotiators to move off extreme positions, to genuinely seek paths of convergence and to provide reassurance in the face of real anxieties.\" Appearing on The AM Show on Thursday, Newshub political editor Tova O'Brien told host Duncan Garner that Ms Ardern's comments are a \"dig\" at Mr Trump. \"If I was Trump, I would return fire and say 'hang on Jacinda, what about your transport industry... you can hardly talk love',\" Garner responded. \"He should say something like that, because quite frankly New Zealanders are running around polluting the world and we're not being punished for it.\" O'Brien said Mr Trump was unlikely to be listening to Ms Ardern. \"Maybe the US President could raise some of those gripes around New Zealand's climate action, but I don't really think he's hearing any of the other countries at the UN are saying at the moment,\" she says. \"He's very much putting America first -as he says, 'making America great again'.\" Ms Ardern also met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the UN, where she brought up trade issues. \"In New Zealand, we've had the experience that globalisation, the opening up of trade and the reduction of barriers hasn't benefited everyone equally,\" she said. \"So we launched a trade for all agenda; we're asking New Zealanders what they want to see from future free trade agreements. We want to model what prosperous trade that benefits and creates a more inclusive society and lifts everyone up more generally would [look] like.\" Newshub.", "headline": "Jacinda Ardern attacks 'extreme positions' on climate change", "article_name": "jacinda-ardern-attacks-extreme-positions-on-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/09/jacinda-ardern-attacks-extreme-positions-on-climate-change.html", "date_published": "2018-09-27 09:56:36", "article_length": 3292, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:47.169047"}

It is the most number of states to endorse an international agreement on day one and backers hope this will inspire swift implementation. Many states still need a parliamentary vote to formally approve the agreement. It will only enter into force when ratified by at least 55 nations representing 55 percent of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \"wants to use the event to generate momentum around implementation and early entry into force of the Paris agreement\", said Selwin Hart, director of Ban's climate change support team. Some experts predict the 55 percent thresholds can be reached this year. The UN said 13 countries, mostly small island developing states, are due to deposit instruments of ratification on Friday (local time). The UN expects about 60 heads of state and government at the signing ceremony. French President Francois Hollande and Hollywood actor and environmental activist Leonardo di Caprio are expected to attend. China and the United States, the world's top emitters accounting together for 38 percent of emissions, are due to sign, along with Russia and India, who round out the top four. Many developing nations are pushing to ensure the climate deal comes into force this year, partly to lock in the US if a Republican opponent of the pact is elected president in November. Even if the pact is fully implemented, promised greenhouse gas cuts are insufficient to limit warming to an agreed maximum, the United Nations says. The first three months of 2016 have broken temperature records and 2015 was the warmest year since records began in the 19th century, with heat waves, droughts and rising sea levels. Warm waters have done widespread damage to corals in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, and sea ice in the Arctic hit a record winter low last month. \"The magnitude of the changes has been a surprise even for veteran climate scientists,\" said Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organisation. Australia will be represented by Environment Minister Greg Hunt. Environmental activists are calling for greater action from Canberra after extensive surveying of the Great Barrier Reef found 93 percent of the 2300km-long natural wonder has been affected by coral bleaching as a result of warmer ocean temperatures.

In an  interview with the BBC , the teenager suggested the fury of climate change deniers can be a helpful tool for generating interest in protests over inaction on global warming. The comments came ahead of  COP26 - the United Nations' Climate Change Conference  - which is being held in Glasgow, Scotland over the next fortnight. \"To make clear, as long as no-one gets hurt, then I think sometimes you need to anger some people,\" she told BBC journalist Andrew Marr. \"Like, for instance, the school strike movement would never have become so big if there wasn't friction, if some people didn't get pissed off.\" The Swede, who at age 18 is one of the world's most prominent climate activists, told Marr she still believes it is \"possible in theory\" to prevent temperatures rising more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5C cap  set out in an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report \u00a0earlier this year\u00a0would help the planet avoid some devastating climate impacts, such as deadly heatwaves and storms. Many experts believe keeping temperature rises below this level is an unrealistic target, but Thunberg says it's \"up to us if we want that to happen\". She called on people in countries where the right to protest was protected to stand up for the cause, explaining that she'd spoken to climate activists doing it much tougher in countries like China, which don't share the same freedoms. \"It makes you just feel so grateful that we are actually able to protest and that just puts more responsibility on us who actually have the right to protest, to use that right,\" she said. \"Not just for our sake but for everyone's sake, especially for their sake to help them as well.\" The IPCC report released earlier this year, a culmination of years of research from climate scientists from around the world, paints a  horrifying picture of what humanity is doing to the climate . It found 50-year heatwaves could become almost annual events and suggests a potential sea level rise of 15m in the next couple of hundred years, and 22m in the next two millennia if emissions aren't reined in.\u00a0 On Sunday, the Government announced a  new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)  and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030.", "headline": "Greta Thunberg says school strike for climate movement only became so big because it 'pissed off' nay-sayers", "article_name": "greta-thunberg-says-school-strike-for-climate-movement-only-became-so-big-because-it-pissed-off-nay-sayers", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2021/11/greta-thunberg-says-school-strike-for-climate-movement-only-became-so-big-because-it-pissed-off-nay-sayers.html", "date_published": "2021-11-01 14:39:00", "article_length": 2623, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:47.902745"}

Credits: Image - Getty; Video - Newshub Next year car suppliers must report the amount of CO2 the vehicles they import to New Zealand emit and meet targets set by the Government to try and reduce transport emissions.\u00a0 \u00a0 The Clean Car Import Standard was announced as part of Labour's manifesto during the 2020 election campaign, and after winning a huge majority, the Labour Government is forging ahead with its climate promises.\u00a0 \"We're moving quickly to introduce a Clean Car Import Standard to reduce emissions and Kiwis' fuel costs,\" Transport Minister Michael Wood said on Thursday, adding that legislation will be passed this year and the standard will begin in 2022.\u00a0 \"The Import Standard will prevent up to 3 million tonnes of emissions by 2040, mean more climate-friendly cars are available, and will give families average lifetime fuel savings of nearly $7000 per vehicle. \"The Government will also consider options for an incentive scheme to help Kiwis make the switch to clean cars. The Government will have further announcements on our plan to reduce transport emissions in the coming months.\" The Clean Car Standard is a CO2 target for light vehicles, defined as vehicles with weight of no more than 3.5 metric tons, so most sedans, vans, SUVs and utes.\u00a0 The standard aims to progressively lower the CO2 emissions of vehicles entering New Zealand, with progressive annual targets introduced each year to help suppliers slowly adjust to the 105 grams of CO2 per km (g/km) target in 2025.\u00a0 It works by averaging, so vehicles exceeding the CO2 target can continue to be brought in so long as they are offset by enough zero and low emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids.\u00a0 The standard will be put in place next year and suppliers will have to start reporting CO2 data, but they will not be penalised for not meeting their targets.\u00a0 Charges will apply when suppliers miss their targets once 2023 rolls around. By 2024, the Government will review penalties and the 2025 target, and set targets for the future.\u00a0\u00a0 The new rules will not apply to vehicles intended for military operational purposes, nor will it apply to agricultural vehicles and equipment primarily used on farms, such as tractors, mowers and harvesters.\u00a0 Vehicles with historic value will also be exempt, as well as any cars constructed before January 1, 1919. Vehicles constructed after that date and are at least 40 years old on the date they were registered or licenced will also be excused.\u00a0 Waka Kotahi, the NZ Transport Agency, will develop an online tracking and forecasting tool to allow importers to see how their CO2 accounts would be affected if they purchase particular vehicles in international auctions.\u00a0 The tool would also help importers complying on a fleet-basis by allowing them to monitor how their fleet's average CO2 emissions are tracking, against their fleet targets.\u00a0 Flexibility will be given for the industry by allowing them to bank, borrow and transfer. Banking will allow suppliers to carry over any overachievement of their CO2 targets to offset the following three years.\u00a0 Borrowing will allow suppliers to miss their targets for one year as long as they can make it up the following year, while transferring allows them to transfer overachievement f their CO2 target to one or more suppliers.\u00a0 New Zealand is only one of two countries in the OECD without a vehicle CO2 standard, the other nation is Russia. Australia's vehicle industry has implemented its own vehicle standard.\u00a0 The average vehicle in New Zealand has CO2 emissions of around 171 g/km. New Zealand cars and SUVs alone average 161 g/km, compared to 105 g/km in Europe. In 2017, the most efficient vehicle models on our market had, on average, 21 percent higher emissions than their counterpart models in the UK.\u00a0 The 2025 target of 105 g/km was already achieved by Japan in 2014 and by Europe in 2020. On average, New Zealanders pay 65 percent more in annual vehicle fuel costs than people in the European Union, even though Europe's petrol prices are higher. A conservative estimate of benefits and costs prepared by the Ministry of Transport indicates that the standard would be a cost effective way of reducing emissions. The value ranges from $248 million to $836 million.\u00a0 The benefits in fuel savings and CO2 reductions are in the order of $160 to $344 from every tonne of CO2 avoided through the standard. The Motor Industry Association says it welcomes constructive policies that will lead to an increased rate in the reduction of CO2 emissions, but fears the 2025 target will come around too quickly for suppliers to keep up.\u00a0 \"The speed at which we must reach the average target of 105 grams of CO2 per km is the most aggressive and severe in the world. No other country has ever had to face a 40 percent rate of reduction in five years that we now must meet.\" The Clean Car Import Standard will be introduced along with an agreement in principle to mandate a lower emitting biofuel blend across the transport sector, which has been welcomed by Air New Zealand.\u00a0 \"While we see hydrogen-powered or electric aircraft as viable options for our domestic and short haul network, being able to access Sustainable Aviation Fuels at a competitive price will be very important for us when it comes to decarbonising our long haul operations,\" CEO Greg Foran said.\u00a0 The Government is also committing $50 million to help councils fully decarbonise the public transport bus fleet by 2035, to help meet New Zealand's 2050 carbon neutral target.\u00a0 \"Transport makes up our second highest amount of emissions after agriculture, so it's important we reduce emissions from our vehicle fleet,\" said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. \"Tackling climate change is a priority for the Government and remains a core part of our COVID recovery plan.

Nearly half of New Zealand's emissions come from agriculture, followed by energy - mostly transport.\u00a0 Since 1990, New Zealand's greenhouse gases have increased nearly 60 percent, while the likes of Japan, Australia, the UK and Sweden are all seeing decreases, of up to 73 percent.\u00a0 The Government has banned new offshore oil and gas exploration and established the Climate Change Commission which will advise governments on how to meet targets set in the Zero Carbon Act passed in 2019.\u00a0 The targets include zero net carbon emissions by 2050 and a reduction of between 24 and 47 percent of methane emissions by 2050. These targets are intended to keep global warming to within 1.5C by 2050. The Government announced in July 2019 it had reached a consensus with the agriculture sector on the need to implement pricing on emissions from 2025.\u00a0 It was then decided in October 2019 that farmers would be given five years to develop practical ways to measure and price emissions at the farm-level, to be separate from the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).\u00a0 Agriculture will be included in the ETS if an alternative isn't figured out by 2025. But either way, farmers would get a 95 percent discount - despite agriculture making up about half of New Zealand's reported emissions.\u00a0 \"That's hardly likely to incentivise behaviour change,\" Daadler writes. \"While the Government dithers, climate change is real and it is only getting worse.\" He said while New Zealand makes up only 0.2 percent of global emissions, it makes up just 0.06 percent of the world's population meaning we are \"emitting more than our fair share\" of emissions.\u00a0 Shaw said over the next 12 months the Government will agree the first three emissions budgets required under the Zero Carbon Act.\u00a0 It will also publish an emissions reduction plan to meet these budgets, consider updating New Zealand's target under the Paris Agreement, and adopt a plan to meet our international obligations for the period 2021-2030. \"Work is underway on each of these and together they will ensure we are playing our part to cut global emissions in half by 2030.\" Thunberg said in video on Friday that global leaders are failing to deliver on the ambition set out in the Paris Agreement five years ago to hold the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\u00a0 The United Nations and research groups recently warned that pledges so far to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would put the world on track for 3C or more of warming this century.\u00a0 The report produced by the United Nations Environment Programme and other research groups said the 1.5C target requires fossil fuel production to decrease by around 6 percent per year between 2020 and 2030 but fossil fuel producers are still expanding production.\u00a0 \"Hypothetical targets are being set and big speeches are being given, yet when it comes to the immediate action we need, we are still in state of complete denial,\" Thunberg said.\u00a0 \"We are still speeding in the wrong direction.\"", "headline": "Climate Change Minister James Shaw admits New Zealand has 'long way to go' after Greta Thunberg criticism ", "article_name": "climate-change-minister-james-shaw-admits-new-zealand-has-long-way-to-go-after-greta-thunberg-criticism", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/12/climate-change-minister-james-shaw-admits-new-zealand-has-long-way-to-go-after-greta-thunberg-criticism.html", "date_published": "2020-12-14 12:36:48", "article_length": 5001, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:48.852448"}

The 38-year-old, preparing for the Australian Open, issued a statement saying he had a \"great deal of respect and admiration\" for the youth climate movement inspired by Thunberg. \"I take the impacts and threat of climate change very seriously, particularly as my family and I arrive in Australia amidst devastation from the bushfires,\" Federer said. \"As the father of four young children and a fervent supporter of universal education, I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the youth climate movement, and I am grateful to young climate activists for pushing us all to examine our behaviours and act on innovative solutions. \"We owe it to them and ourselves to listen. I appreciate reminders of my responsibility as a private individual, as an athlete and as an entrepreneur, and I'm committed to using this privileged position to dialogue on important issues with my sponsors.\" Federer will join other top players including Serena Williams at charity event Rally for Relief in Melbourne next week, raising funds for the efforts to tackle the devastating bushfires that have killed at least 28 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and decimated wildlife. Credit Suisse says it is committed to leading the way in supporting its clients in the transition to low- carbon and climate- resilient business models and recently announced in the context of its global climate strategy that it will no longer invest in new coal-fired power plants.

And climate change experts say while the wildfires so far haven't afflicted us so badly, we're likely to see more extreme weather events as climate change continues. Sixty-five firefighters will fly to Canada shortly, and can expect to be using techniques they learn when they get back home as climate change bites. Firefighter team leader John Sutton says: \"It's almost like a boost to morale, someone cares and someone's here to help.\" The experience they gain will be invaluable ahead of the fires they say will burn New Zealand this summer. \"They are becoming more intense and complex and it's a way of training our people and developing their skills,\" Mr Sutton says. Thirty-eight New Zealand firefighters are already in California, and are among the more than 15,000 people tackling 18 blazes. \"This has been a challenging and deadly fire season just in the month of July,\" California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection chief Ken Pimlott said. \"Four firefighters perished fighting the fires in california many many members of the public have been put at risk, injured and a number of fatalities.\" Europe too is touching record temperatures above the 40degC mark as fires burn out of control in the Iberian Peninsula. In Australia it's still winter, but fire is licking the Pacific Highway too - and the sun is parching the soil further inland, taking farmers beyond breaking point in the worst drought since 1965. Charity worker Edwina Robertson broke down as she told Australia's Prime Minister of another rural suicide. Scientists say extreme heatwaves are now twice as likely, as weather events that used to be exceptional become expected. Weather experts say because of climate change, New Zealand will be no different from the rest of the world - there will be more extreme weather events, more wildfires, more droughts and more floods. Victoria University climate scientist James Renwick says climate change has forced the temperature up 1degC - but warns at present rates of carbon dioxide emission, it'll rise by another 1degC in just two decades. \"Pretty much the whole of the eastern part of New Zealand - that's from south of Dunedin right through to East Cape - would be in that very high or extreme danger zone for four or five or six months of the year.\" Newshub.", "headline": "Scientist warns of climate change's effects on New Zealand", "article_name": "scientist-warns-of-climate-change-s-effects-on-new-zealand", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/08/scientist-warns-of-climate-change-s-effects-on-new-zealand.html", "date_published": "2018-08-06 18:51:47", "article_length": 2404, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:49.228079"}

Credits: Video - Newshub Nation; Images - Getty Images/Newshub Nation James Shaw says he has confidence Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern can deliver on climate change - because if she doesn't, she'll literally be breaking the law.\u00a0 The independent Climate Change Commission  delivered its advice earlier this week , and Cabinet is obligated to do what it says or find another way to achieve the same emissions reductions, the Climate Change Minister told Newshub Nation on Saturday.\u00a0 \"If they don't accept the recommendations, they've got to come up with something better that produces the same outcome otherwise they are in violation of the law.\" The Zero Carbon Act, passed in 2019, established the Climate Change Commission, required the Government to set emissions budgets and set rules for how the Government must respond to the commission's recommendations. If the Government decides to go against the commission's advice, it has to explain why. \"The law says we have to stick within that 1.5C pathway, to stick within those emissions budgets,\" said Shaw. \"If they don't accept the series of policy recommendations for how to fit into that, they've got to come up with something that does do that, otherwise the Government itself is in violation of its own law.\"\u00a0 Asked if he had confidence Ardern was the right person to deliver on climate change, Shaw said he did.\u00a0 He also has confidence the country's economically vital agriculture sector will meet its methane reduction targets. Methane doesn't hang around in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide, but while it's there, has a much bigger warming effect. \"Cutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years, and complements necessary efforts to reduce carbon dioxide,\" Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said earlier this week. The current goal is a 10 percent reduction below 2017 levels by 2030, and between 24 and 47 percent by 2050.\u00a0 \"I actually think they'll sail through that with some of the innovations that are going on,\" said Shaw. \"I know that in some of the test farms they've had in different parts of the country have increased profitability and reduced methane output by over 10 percent - I think by about 14 percent - just with on-farm practise changes. No new technology, no kind of magic science, anything like that - just with improvements to how the farm works.\"\u00a0 The commission's report didn't mention any need for a  stock cull . Shaw said while that would work, it might not be needed in many cases - but farmers who have reduced their stock numbers have benefited.\u00a0 \"Some of the most innovative and profitable farms in the country have gone from a really high-cost, high-input model - a really intensive form of dairying which actually had pretty thin profit margins - and they've gone to things like once-a-day milking, they've gone to less-intensive stocking on the land which means they've got lower input costs. So a couple of things happen - the methane output goes down, the nitrous oxide goes down and their profits go up.\" Shaw repeatedly talked about the need for a climate change plan that everyone can agree on.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The model is kind of built in a way to maintain a level of social consensus because we are asking a lot of everybody. And there are some sectors that for various reasons are quite resistant to change or will find it very difficult to change - I'm not going to name anyone in particular - but... we've managed to create a level of social consensus\u00a0 that everyone can look at each other and go, 'Okay, I get that I'm going to have to take action - as long as everybody else does too.'\" He refused to answer a question from host Tova O'Brien on what parts of the commission's report he felt didn't go far enough. \"I'm not going to give you a response to that question, which I know that you're going to not find terribly satisfying... I'm not a patient person. I want to be moving a lot faster on climate change. But my job here is to make sure that actually New Zealand starts finally reducing emissions over the coming decades, and actually moves much quicker than we have in the past.\" He noted the final report was tougher in places than some earlier drafts. \"In some cases what they have said is similar to what the industry itself has said, in some cases they've pushed industries to go further. In a couple of cases they low-balled it in the draft advice and the industry themselves came to them and said, 'Hey - we actually think we can go faster than you're describing,' so they've upped the ante.\" If New Zealand - and the world - doesn't tackle global warming, Shaw said New Zealand can expect \"more frequent and more severe droughts, more frequent and more severe storms, flooding, fires like the ones you saw on the Port Hills a few years ago or in the Nelson region\". \"The impact on that is mostly on our agricultural sector. The really severe  drought we saw in 2014  knocked about $1.5 billion off our agricultural exports.\" Watch Newshub Nation 9:30am Saturday/10am Sunday on TV3, and follow us on\u00a0 Facebook \u00a0and\u00a0 Twitter .

{"id": null, "body": "There's no point trying to fight climate change - we'll all be dead in the next decade and there's nothing we can do to stop it, a visiting scientist claims. Guy McPherson, a biology professor at the University of Arizona, says the human destruction of our own habitat is leading towards the world's sixth mass extinction. Instead of fighting, he says we should just embrace it and live life while we can. \"It's locked down, it's been locked in for a long time - we're in the midst of our sixth mass extinction,\" he told Paul Henry on Thursday. But Professor James Renwick, a climate scientist at Victoria University, says people should not use his words more as an excuse to give up. While he agrees that climate change is possibly the \"biggest issue humanity has ever faced\", he says \"giving up is not really helpful\". Instead, Prof Renwick says he hopes Prof McPherson's 10-year claim will encourage people to take action. \"This is a really big issue and the consequences could be catastrophic,\" Prof Renwick says. \"Though certainly [humans won't all die off] in 10 years or even 1000 years.\" The effects of climate change were first noticed 30 years ago and Prof Renwick says the sooner we get onto working against it, the less there will be to do. \"I'd love to see [people] take it on board as it is a very serious issue.\" Prof McPherson's comments come just days after Climate Change Issues Minister Paula Bennett appointed a 10-strong team to advise the Government on how New Zealand can adapt to climate change. But if the visiting professor is right, it could all be a waste of time. \"I can't imagine there will be a human on the planet in 10 years,\" he says. \"We don't have 10 years. The problem is when I give a number like that, people think it's going to be business as usual until nine years [and] 364 days.\" He says part of the reason he's given up while other scientists fight on is because they're looking at individual parts, such as methane emissions and the melting ice in the Arctic, instead of the entire picture. \"We're heading for a temperature within that span that is at or near the highest temperature experienced on Earth in the last 2 billion years.\" Instead of trying to fix the climate, Prof McPherson says we should focus on living while we can. \"I think hope is a horrible idea. Hope is wishful thinking. Hope is a bad idea - let's abandon that and get on with reality instead. Let's get on with living instead of wishing for the future that never comes. \"I encourage people to pursue excellence, to pursue love, to pursue what they love to do. I don't think these are crazy ideas, actually - and I also encourage people to remain calm because nothing is under control, certainly not under our control anyway.\" New Zealand has been criticised by the international community for not doing enough to fight climate change - this month being awarded two Fossil of the Day awards at the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech. The awards are for the country's failure to live up to climate promises and the continued use of \"dodgy\" carbon credits.

Credits: Video - The AM Show; Image - Getty One of New Zealand's top scientists says a new study highlighting the plight of the world's glaciers is \"sobering stuff\" and shows we have little time left to stop filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. Glaciers worldwide are now losing 298 billion tonnes of ice every year,  the study published in  Nature  found , up from 227 billion tonnes 20 years ago.\u00a0 New Zealand glaciers are losing about 1.5m a year, shrinking seven times faster than they were in the early 2000s.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Some of them are hundreds of metres thick so you might think 1.5 metres doesn't' sound like much, but that's on top of another 1.5m and another 1.5m,\" James Renwick, a climate scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, told The AM Show on Thursday.\u00a0 \"We can see in photographs of things like the Tasman Glacier, we can see how much thinner it is now... it used to be up the side of the valley and now it's much below that.\" In February, Wellington geologist Christoph Kraus sent Newshub two photos he took of\u00a0 the Franz Josef Glacier - one taken in 2007, the other this year - which starkly illustrated the problem. In 2007 the glacier reached right down into the valley, but in 2020 it could hardly be seen.\u00a0 \"I knew it had retreated over that time, but it was still surreal to see it in person,\" he said. The new study used high-resolution imagery from NASA's Terra satellite to track the size of glaciers from around the world.\u00a0 Glacier melting accounts for about a fifth of sea level rise, scientists estimate - the rest coming from thermal expansion - warm water expands - and the melting of permafrost and ice sheets. Glaciers respond more quickly to climate change, so are something of a canary in the coalmine.\u00a0 \"The biggest pieces of ice, the big ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland, they're going to keep melting for hundreds of years into the future even if we turn off the tap now, but at a very slow rate,\" said Dr Renwick. \"It's all a question of how quickly we can stop increasing the warming and eventually the ice melt will stop.\" There are various estimates of how much sea levels will rise in the coming decades and centuries.\u00a0 The current best estimate from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is it'll rise nearly a metre by 2100; other studies have suggested three-metre rises are possible by then, and up to 25m over the next few hundred years, depending on what measures the world takes to stop it. Dr Renwick says there's only one real solution.\u00a0 \"Stop emitting greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. Do what the Zero Carbon Act is calling for, do what the Paris Agreement is calling for. If we can stop the increase in greenhouse gases in the air, that will stop the warming and that will stop the ice melting... that's the way to go.\"\u00a0 Some scientists are sceptical that will bring back what we've already lost.\u00a0 \"I have no expectation, in all honesty, that even substantial action to reduce our emissions and control the Earth's temperature rise is going to grow our glaciers,\" Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, told Reuters.

It's likely he was referring to the Government's announcement earlier this year it would  stop issuing exploration permits for new oil and gas fields , with a few exceptions. While the Government has emphasised existing permits will be honoured, perhaps leading to decades' more drilling, National MP Judith Collins  said in April the ban was the \"worst thing\"  the Government could have done for New Zealand's emissions. \"Natural gas is a very clean-burning fuel and currently fuels about 16 percent of our electricity supply,\" she told The AM Show, saying power generators would turn to dirty coal to keep the turbines running. Mr Bridges holds that view too, pledging to overturn the ban. \"I would argue environmentally that would be the right thing in terms of a clean natural gas, rather than coal and so on.

Credits: The AM Show James Shaw says he's okay with making Greenpeace angry sometimes, as long as they keep pushing the Government to implement stronger environmental policies. Shaw, the Climate Change Minister and Green Party co-leader, is facing a barrage of criticism from the environmental group, led by former Green Party leader Russel Norman, over the Government's proposal to bring farmers into the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).\u00a0 The Government put forward two short-term options for action on agriculture's climate pollution on Tuesday, one suggested by the Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC) and one from the farming sector.\u00a0 Farmers want to leave agriculture out of the ETS altogether, with the industry paying nothing for emissions until 2025. The agriculture sector would instead enter into a voluntary agreement with the Government.\u00a0 The ICCC's option would bring agriculture into the ETS between 2021 and 2025, and charge processors like Fonterra for 5 percent of their agriculture emissions. That money would be funnelled back into the sector.\u00a0 Post- 2025 the Government is proposing agriculture won't go into the ETS at all and will instead have a separate levy-rebate scheme for their emissions. Norman isn't happy with either of the short-term suggestions. He wants emitters to pay, but says a five percent tax is far too low. \"Obviously it's pretty modest, 5 percent in a couple of years is a pretty modest outcome and doesn't really meet what we need to do. \"In terms of the price, I mean this is one cent per kilo of milk solids, so it's an extremely low price signal to drive the reduction in emissions that we need if we're going to have a sustainable future.\" Shaw defended the proposal, saying adding agriculture into the ETS would be a big step forward globally. \"We are the first country in the world that has said we will put a price on agricultural emissions on any level, even at 5 percent, and I know other countries are looking at us and seeing how we do it before they adopt a similar system. \"We are showing leadership by doing this.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has told the United Nations that member states must immediately combat the \"extraordinary threat that climate change poses\" to \"prevent the worst\" from happening. But she said New Zealand was up for that challenge and was determined to be \"the most sustainable food producer in the world\". Speaking on Monday (local time) at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Ardern recalled her visit to the remote atolls of Tokelau earlier this year, where she said she heard \"a message of urgency\". \"With a population of 1500 people that is only accessible by boat, they have a story not often heard but a message that must be shared,\" she told attendees. \"It's a message underscored by their new coastal walls which are already toppling over from the assault by the sea. By their seaside burial grounds, which are eroding and shifting. \"And by the children who tell you they are worried about the future of their home.\" Ardern said climate change poses an \"extraordinary threat\", but to overcome it, member states must \"start with an honest appraisal of our current situation\". The Prime Minister then outlined that situation for New Zealand, noting that while Aotearoa only accounts for 0.17 percent of global emissions, gross emissions have increased by more than 23 percent since 1990 and net emissions by 65 percent. But she said things were turning around, with gross emissions peaking in 2006 and now 80 percent of our electricity coming from renewable sources.\u00a0 Ardern pointed to Government policies enacted to combat climate issues, such as the  Zero Carbon Bill currently before Parliament  which would create a legally binding objective to limit global warming to no more than 1.5degC with a net-zero carbon approach. \"We are strengthening our Emissions Trading Scheme to more effectively price climate pollution,\" she said. \"We aim to plant one billion trees by 2028 - 150 million are already in the ground.\" Among other actions she listed were efforts to make electric cars more affordable and investing in cycling infrastructure. \"Our farming leaders have made their own commitment to cutting emissions from food production,\" she said. \"Over the next five years, we will collaborate to build systems that every farmer will be able to use to measure, manage and reduce their own farm's emissions.\u00a0 \"We are determined to show that we can be the most sustainable food producers in the world. \u00a0\"That's why we will continue to lead international collaboration through the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouses Gases.\" She finished her speech by saying that \"New Zealand can and will play our part in the global effort\". \"Secretary General, the situation is stark. It will not be easy. But our generation - we - have it within our grasp, not just to prevent the worst, but to build the best possible world for the generations to come.\" Ardern is spending the rest of the day meeting with head of states,  such as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson , and technology leaders as they assess work so far on the Christchurch Call. She  will also have a brief meeting with US President Donald Trump , but the focus will be on trade, not climate change.\u00a0 \"[Climate change] is a big focus here. I wouldn't be surprised if it does [come up], but I imagine we'll talk about a number of things - even though we have a short 20 minutes together... I'm careful not to predetermine or pre-script some of the conversations that we have. Twenty minutes together, any number of things can be talked about,\" Ardern said. As well as promising to withdraw the United States from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, Trump has rolled back a number of his predecessor Barack Obama's efforts to reduce the United States' emissions, even making efforts to boost fossil fuel extraction and use, contrary to scientists' warnings.\u00a0 Earlier this year I visited the remote atolls of Tokelau in the South Pacific. With a population of 1,500 people that is only accessible by boat, they have a story not often heard but a message that must be shared. It's a message underscored by their new coastal walls which are already toppling over from the assault by the sea. By their seaside burial grounds, which are eroding and shifting. And by the children who tell you they are worried about the future of their home. It's a message of urgency, one you yourself heard, Mr Secretary General, when you visited the Pacific recently. If we are to overcome the extraordinary threat that climate change poses we all must start with an honest appraisal of our current situation. Although New Zealand accounts only account for 0.17 percent of the global total our gross emissions have increased a little over 23 percent since 1990 and our net emissions by 65 percent. But, also as with many here, things are starting to turn around. Our gross emissions peaked in 2006. Over 80 percent of our electricity already comes from renewable hydro and wind. And we have begun an ambitious agenda. We have introduced to Parliament the Zero Carbon Bill, the purpose of which is to ensure New Zealand lives within the threshold of 1.5\u02daC of global warming necessary for the wellbeing of our Pacific neighbours. We are strengthening our Emissions Trading Scheme to more effectively price climate pollution. We aim to plant one billion trees by 2028 \u2013 150 million are already in the ground. We have stopped issuing any new permits for offshore oil and gas exploration. In their place we are investing in green hydrogen, biofuels and the goal of 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035. We're making electric and cleaner cars more affordable. We're investing heavily in rail, trains, buses, walking and cycling infrastructure. We've established a $100m Green Investment Fund to help shift private investment towards the zero-carbon economy of the future. Our business community is stepping up with a Climate Leaders' Coalition that together represents fully 60 percent of New Zealand's gross emissions. Our farming leaders have made their own commitment to cutting emissions from food production. Over the next five years we will collaborate to build systems that every farmer will be able to use to measure, manage and reduce their own farm's emissions.\u00a0 We are determined to show that we can be the most sustainable food producers in the world. That's why we will continue to lead international collaboration through the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouses Gases. We are determined that New Zealand can and will play our part in the global effort.\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Secretary General, the situation is stark. It will not be easy. But our generation \u2013 we \u2013 have it within our grasp, not just to prevent the worst, but to build the best possible world for the generations to come.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty The world's oceans are heating up faster than previously thought, new research has found. Scientists say it's the strongest sign yet climate change is accelerating, as the heat of the oceans isn't affected by day-to-day variations in weather, like on land. Researchers at the University of California went over four recent papers detailing changes beneath the waves.  They found  not only are the oceans getting warmer, but the rate of change is speeding up. \"While 2018 will be the fourth warmest year on record on the surface, it will most certainly be the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that,\" said Zeke Hausfather, who co-authored the latest research. \"The global warming signal is a lot easier to detect if it is changing in the oceans than on the surface.\" More than 90 percent of the excess energy trapped on Earth by greenhouse gases is soaked up by the ocean. Even if melting of the polar ice caps stopped completely - which won't happen - the expected best-case scenario of a 0.78degC rise in ocean temperatures by the end of the century will still see sea levels rise by 30cm worldwide, thanks to thermal expansion. Climate change sceptics have long pointed to  an apparent cooling of the climate in the decade after 1998's peak as evidence it's all a hoax , but Mr Hausfather says recent measurements have put the debate to rest. \"These four new records that have been published in recent years seem to fix a lot of problems that were plaguing the old records, and now they seem to agree quite well with what the climate models have produced.\" The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned unprecedented action was needed to stop hundreds of thousands of species going extinct, natural environments dying and coastal communities being flooded out of existence. The Paris Agreement saw nations pledge to work to keep temperature rises below 2degC, but the IPCC's latest report says that has to come down to 1.5degC.

We are certainly trying to do our bit.\" She told students on Wednesday not to \"underestimate this global movement\" which she said is not only about sending a message to politicians, but also \"sending a message to the rest of the country... helping spread the message of why\".\u00a0 \"This is a generational issue - a longstanding challenge that will go beyond electoral cycles, so it's not just about what we adopt, it's about what successive governments choose to adopt,\" Ms Ardern said.\u00a0 \"We need to give certainty to a whole range of communities. We need to give certainty to your generation, we need to give certainty to businesses that are making investment decisions around energy generation, and we need to give certainty around security of supply. \"We can give that greater certainty if we have consensus amongst us, and that consensus is formed when not only political parties come together, but actually when civil society and the public does as well.\" The Prime Minister concluded by saying the student strike is \"helping us with that\". \"I'd like to think we're already on board, we're ready and we recognise this challenge and we're doing what we can.

You'd see prices go through the roof, and of course it's people with low incomes and from poorer families who have the least choice.\"\u00a0 He said the world has a \"period of time\" where fossil fuels can be phased out, and that \"buys us time to bring in more renewables into the mix until we can get to that goal of 100 percent renewable\".\u00a0 Newshub.", "headline": "Student asks Jacinda Ardern what difference School Strike 4 Climate will make ", "article_name": "student-asks-jacinda-ardern-what-difference-school-strike-4-climate-will-make", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/03/student-asks-jacinda-ardern-what-difference-school-strike-4-climate-will-make.html", "date_published": "2019-03-13 15:25:44", "article_length": 3864, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:51.270533"}
{"id": null, "body": "By Eric Frykberg of RNZ New Zealand runs a serious risk of failing to meet  legally mandated goals  on climate change, according to the Forest Owners Association. That would happen if the Government went ahead with halting forest conversions of farmland if they occurred too often. The possibility of state intervention against afforestation was mentioned - but not promised - by Minister of Agriculture Damien O'Connor, speaking at a Parliamentary select committee last week. The conversion of farmland into forestry has repeatedly been accused of undermining thriving rural communities and replacing them with a \"green desert\". This would be even worse with trees grown for carbon credits, not timber, since rural communities - stripped of farm workers - would not get an economic boost from visiting pruning contractors or tree felling gangs either. Instead, absentee landowners would cash carbon sequestration cheques from afar, and the spread of wealth would stop there. O'Connor was repeatedly challenged on this threat to the rural way of life at Parliament's Primary Production Select Committee. He replied that it was not the Government's role to tell landowners what they should or should not do with their land, but the Government was concerned, and would probably move to restrict forest planting it if exceeded 40,000 hectares a year. The Forest Owners Association has hit back, saying New Zealand would fail to achieve a carbon neutral economy by 2050, if it gave way to what it called an \"anti tree campaign\". This carbon neutral goal was enshrined in the Zero Carbon Act, and so was legally required, it said. Association vice president Grant Dodson said the Productivity Commission had estimated between 2.1 and 2.8 million hectares of tree planting was necessary to get to carbon zero. \"The simple maths is that at least an extra 70,000 hectares a year on average needs to be planted over the next 30 years,\" Dodson said. \"If you restrict planting to 40,000 hectares a year, then you are at least 30,000 hectares in carbon deficit. \"This is very much at odds with New Zealand's climate change goals and with the things other parts of the Government are trying to achieve.\" Dodson went on to say the minister was proposing to restrict what he said was a fundamental right for farmers to decide what sort of business they conducted on their own farms. \"Land use change is always a flexibility that we have enjoyed,\" he said. \"There has been a lot of change from sheep farming to dairy farming, to forestry, there have been numerous trends. \"It's about having a productive economy.\" Dodson went on further to criticise both O'Connor and Forestry Minister Shane Jones. \"Neither minister is informed by any examination of the issues and there's been no meaningful consultation,\" Dodson said. \"It looks like both ministers are driven by noisy lobby groups who want to get special deals.\" Despite this hostility, Jones said the fight against the spread of forestry could go further. New Zealand First was working on an election policy that would require landowners to get resource consent to plant trees, with the aim of slowing down the spread of trees planted for carbon credits on agricultural land. Landowners must already do this in places where wilding pines are a risk, but Jones said this principle could be extended to all of New Zealand and cover economic risks as well.

{"id": null, "body": "James Renwick for The Conversation. New Zealand's Climate Change Commission today released its long-anticipated advice to the government on how to reshape the economy to meet the country's domestic and international climate change obligations. The document sets out three emissions budgets, covering 15 years to 2035 in five-yearly plans. It also provides advice on the direction policy should take to achieve the country's 2050 net-zero goal. New Zealand's net emissions rose by 57 percent\u00a0 between 1990 and 2018, placing it among the poorest performers in the OECD. As one of New Zealand's six climate change commissioners I have been part of the process of making a clear case to government that we must take \"immediate and decisive action on climate change\" across all sectors. The commission's priorities include a rapid shift to electric transport, accelerated renewable energy generation, climate-friendly farming practices and more permanent forests, predominantly in native trees. It also says New Zealand must raise its pledge under the Paris Agreement, known as the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), because its current commitment is not compatible with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The good news is the draft carbon budgets are achievable, with technologies that already exist. The commission's advice is built around 17 recommendations that cover many sectors of the economy. One of the key messages is that Aotearoa New Zealand cannot plant its way out of trouble but needs to make real cuts in emissions and eliminate the use of fossil fuels. Most of the solutions are well known. We need to reduce emissions from transport, from energy and industry, from agriculture and from waste. Recommendations for the transport sector include electrification of the vehicle fleet, improved public transport networks and better integration of active transport (walking and cycling). A rapid increase in electric cars would reduce emissions from private and commercial transport, while supporting low-carbon fuels like \"green\" hydrogen and biofuels would help the freight sector (including heavy trucks, shipping and aircraft). \n Part of the transport story is urban planning \u2014 changing how people and goods move around. The commission recommends limiting urban sprawl, making walking and cycling safer and easier and shifting more freight from road to rail or shipping. The commission also calls for rapid decarbonisation of electricity generation, and energy generally, to phase out the use of coal. Between now and 2035, it estimates New Zealand could cut transport emissions by 47 percent\u00a0 and those coming from heat and electricity generation by 45 percent . Methane accounts for 43.5 percent\u00a0 of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions, and more than 80 percent\u00a0 of total methane comes from cud-chewing farm animals. But the short-lived nature of methane in the atmosphere means we do not need to reduce methane emissions so fast. The Zero Carbon Act calls for a 24-47 percent\u00a0 reduction in methane emissions by 2050, compared to net-zero for carbon dioxide. The commission's advice is that biogenic methane emissions can be reduced by 19 percent\u00a0 by 2035 while further improving productivity in the sector through better feed, fewer but more productive animals and continued research into emission-reducing technologies. The commission calls for real cuts in emissions rather than offsets through tree planting, but argues forestry should continue to play an important role in the long-term storage of carbon, for example if timber is used in buildings or furniture and to provide bioenergy. It recommends a shift towards more permanent native forests to improve long-term carbon storage, biodiversity and soil retention. Waste is another sector with significant potential to cut emissions. Per head of population, New Zealanders throw away roughly twice what an average OECD citizen does. The commission recommends moving towards a circular economy, where resources are valued and reused. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the main issue in the waste sector is methane release from decomposing solid waste. Capturing that gas at source could reduce methane emissions by 14 percent\u00a0 by 2035. The commission's draft budgets recommend an overall reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions of 36 percent\u00a0 by 2035, starting with 2 percent\u00a0 by 2025 and 17 percent\u00a0 by 2030. It estimates the cost of achieving this is less than 1 percent\u00a0 of projected GDP, much lower than was initially thought. The payoffs for public health, for our environment and biodiversity make this a good investment, let alone the huge avoided costs from unchecked climate change. The commission's recommendations will go through a public consultation process until 14 March, and the government has until the end of the year to decide which parts of the advice it takes on board. An important aspect of the advice is inclusiveness and support for all sectors of society as we move to a low-emissions future. The commission takes a te ao M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori world view) approach, making it clear that Aotearoa must have an equitable and fair transition.

More than 97 percent of reported cases of Naegleria fowleri are fatal, with only four survivors of 148 known infections between 1962 and 2019, according to the CDC. The amoebas enter the brain and cause a rare form of meningitis which is very difficult to treat. As soon as people begin to show symptoms it's very unlikely they will survive. Vibrio vulnificus causes necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection in which the flesh surrounding an open wound dies. Not only are temperatures hotter, but they are hotter for longer periods of time, which allows the pathogens to grow in the water. \"It's intensifying the opportunity, and creating more opportunity, for these harmful things to cross our paths,\" Melissa Baldwin, director of Florida Clinicians for Climate Action, told ABC News. But it's not just rising temperatures which can contribute to the faster growth of these dangerous infections.

The report says since 2015, temperatures have been an average 1.1C above pre-industrial times. \"Widespread and long-lasting heatwaves, record-breaking fires and other devastating events such as tropical cyclones, floods and drought have had major impacts on socio-economic development and the environment,\" said the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which contributed to the report. \"Arctic summer sea-ice extent has declined at a rate of approximately 12 percent per decade during 1979-2018. The four lowest values for winter sea-ice extent occurred between 2015 and 2019. \"Overall, the amount of ice lost annually from the Antarctic ice sheet increased at least six-fold between 1979 and 2017. Glacier mass loss for 2015-2019 is the highest for any five-year period on record.\" The WMO's Global Atmosphere Watch said this year carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is expected to rise past 410 parts per million, nearly 50 percent higher than before the Industrial Revolution. A record-high amount of carbon emissions went into the atmosphere in 2018 - up 2 percent to 37 billion tonnes. \"There is still no sign of a peak in global emissions, even though they are growing slower than the global economy,\" said report contributor Global Carbon Budget. \"Despite extraordinary growth in renewable fuels over the past decade, the global energy system is still dominated by fossil fuel sources. The annual increase in global energy use is greater than the increase in renewable energy, meaning the fossil fuel use continues to grow. This growth needs to halt immediately.\" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said to achieve warming of only 1.5C would require \"unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society\". Last week saw  hundreds of thousands go on strike around the globe , demanding leaders take more action to fight climate change. They were inspired by a teenage Swedish girl, whose lone protests in 2018 sparked the worldwide 'school strike for climate' movement.

Credits: Image - Getty Images / Video - Reuters United under Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, young people rallied worldwide on Friday (UK time)\u00a0 to demand urgent action to halt catastrophic climate change, in their first global protest since the COVID-19 crisis began. With wild weather wreaking havoc across the world \u2013 from fires ravaging the U.S. West, to abnormal heatwaves in the Siberian Arctic and record floods in China \u2013 organisers said their aim was to remind politicians that, while the world focused on COVID-19, the climate crisis was more acute than ever. Demonstrations were planned in more than 3100 locations, though with pandemic-related curbs limiting the size of gatherings, much of the action shifted online. In Stockholm, Thunberg and a handful of members of her group, Fridays for Future, assembled outside parliament with signs bearing slogans including \u201cStop Denying the Climate Is Dying.\u201d \u201cWe need to treat the climate crisis as a crisis. It\u2019s just as simple as that. The climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis and unless we treat it as a crisis we won\u2019t be able to, so-called, \u2018solve\u2019 it,\u201d Thunberg told reporters. Organisers said turnout was expected to be far smaller than the global climate strikes held one year ago, which drew more than six million people onto the streets. Participants were asked to post pictures on social media and join a 24-hour global Zoom call - though mass gatherings were held in countries including Germany. In Berlin, police said nearly 10,000 people took part in demonstrations. Protesters cycled in groups to the Brandenburg Gate, where they sat in face masks, observing social distancing and chanting: \"Strikes in school, university and companies. That is our answer to your politics.\" On the front lines . The demonstrations focussed on communities that have contributed little to greenhouse gas emissions, but are on the front lines of devastating climate threats including violent storms, rising seas and locust plagues. Activist Vanessa Nakate, who led 30 young demonstrators in Kampala, Uganda, on Friday, said the climate change debate has tended to sideline voices from vulnerable developing regions. \"The world was so focused on the California fires,\" she told Reuters. \"When California was burning, communities in Africa were flooding - but where was the attention?\" In Kenya's capital Nairobi, about 30 activists gathered in a park, with some donning headgear made of discarded plastic bottles. Their protest centred around media reports, first published in The New York Times, that industry group the American Chemistry Council (ACC) is lobbying to ensure Kenya continues importing foreign plastic trash, despite a government pledge to stop doing this. ACC has said the reports are inaccurate. \"We say Africa is not a dumpsite, and Kenya is not a dumpsite,\" activist Kevin Mtai said. In the Philippines, Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a 22-year-old Fridays for Future activist, said recent flooding had wiped out a local COVID-19 testing centre and caused a tree to fall on her home. \"I hate that it is a normal thing to experience these impacts. I hate that it is a normal thing that people are suffering - because they don't need to,\" she said. People in the global South are dying because of climate change, said 19-year-old Belgian activist Anuna De Wever ahead of a planned protest in a Brussels square. \"As one of the richest continents, we (Europeans) have the biggest responsibility to fight climate change in the most ambitious way possible.\" Mya-Rose Craig, an 18-year-old Briton, travelled to the Arctic - one of the world's fastest warming regions - with Greenpeace to stage the most northerly protest on an ice floe. Activists in Bogota, Colombia, said they would use the event to urge their government to ratify the Escazu Accord, an agreement among Latin American and Caribbean countries that enshrines protections for those working on environmental causes. In Australia, thousands of students earlier took part in about 500 small gatherings and online protests, to demand investment in renewable energy and oppose funding for gas projects. While global climate negotiations have faltered during the pandemic, a surprise announcement by China this week means that two of the world's top three emitters - China and the European Union - have now committed to becoming carbon neutral, halting their net contributions to climate change. Whether the United States, the second-biggest emitter, joins them is likely to depend on the result of November's presidential election.

National coordinator Sophie Handford told Newshub this is expected to be the biggest one yet, with adults also invited to march alongside students.\u00a0 Handford said the response to the strikes has been amazing. But she said leading the strikes hasn't come without its struggles. From anxiety, criticism, and frustration, Handford said climate activism can be gruelling.\u00a0 There has been a little bit of negativity surrounding the tactics we have decided to use - that's mostly been around the strike action.\u00a0 We don't give those people much of our attention because we have better things to be doing.\u00a0 There has definitely been more support than negativity but we are thankful for the negative responses because it has helped us raise awareness. At the end of last year, I saw what Greta Thunberg was doing and saw the strikes in Australia, so I did a bit of research and found nothing in New Zealand. I made a few posts on social media and rallied some people together and we kind of built from there. She's such an inspiration and I think that we should be so thankful she's in our world because I'm not sure if any of this would have kicked off without her. Greta is only one person but look at the impact she has made.\u00a0 I find it so inspiring that someone so young is able to say it straight and just be able to put these global leaders right in their place. I hope they feel guilty, I hope they feel the fear that she feels every single day and I hope they look at her as the courageous leader that she is.\u00a0 In this conversation, your voice matters, so add your voice.\u00a0 Whether that be turning up to the strike or signing an open letter or designing a poster about climate change, take that first step even if it feels overwhelming.\u00a0 I think it's really important to realise the scale of climate change and just do something.\u00a0 We are running out of time to make that impact that we need to in order to pass the planet on so it is crunch time.\u00a0 Our overarching demand is that the New Zealand Government does everything in its power to limit warming to no more than 1.5 degrees because that's the known threshold for livable future on this planet. We then have five demands that sit under that:\u00a0 We are committed to being in this until our demands are met 100 percent. We are still determining whether that looks like more strikes.\u00a0 We are definitely open to exploring more tactics because achieving our demands is the main goal.\u00a0 If we did this on the weekend it would not create the same kind of conversation around the issue and we are not putting anything at risk.\u00a0 By doing it on a Friday, we are taking a stand and saying that we are not willing to learn facts while our leaders continue to ignore the facts and science behind climate change. None of the learning we do will matter if we don't have a future on this earth.\u00a0 I think we are but nowhere near fast enough and nowhere near as ambitious as we need to be.\u00a0 There are some MPs who are really committed and passionate about climate justice, but there are still a few that we have yet to win over.\u00a0 For the past four or five years, I have always felt that climate anxiety but didn't really have a label to put on it until I heard Greta talking about it. It was like a switch flipped in me seeing a 16-year-old girl that is acknowledging the urgency and actually doing something about it. It is frustrating that it is taking a group of young people to wake up an entire world. It shouldn't be up to us young people.\u00a0 There are eight-year-olds and 10-year-olds in the group and they shouldn't feel like they have to do that, they should be on the playground, but instead, they are feeling totally overwhelmed and paralysed by this crisis.\u00a0 Newshub.\u00a0", "headline": "School Strike 4 Climate leader Sophie Handford on why she's protesting", "article_name": "who-is-school-strike-4-climate-leader-sophie-handford-and-what-is-she-trying-to-achieve", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/09/who-is-school-strike-4-climate-leader-sophie-handford-and-what-is-she-trying-to-achieve.html", "date_published": "2019-09-27 10:05:28", "article_length": 4128, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:52.684601"}
{"id": null, "body": "Climate Change Minister James Shaw was warned his climate target was too ambitious, too expensive and could be setting New Zealand up to fail.   Credits: Video - Newshub; Images - Getty Climate change is upon us and humanity is far from ready, the United Nations climate panel warned in a major report on Monday (local time). Noting that nearly half the world's population was already vulnerable to increasingly dangerous climate impacts, the report calls for drastic action on a huge scale: A third to a half of the planet needs to be conserved and protected to ensure future food and freshwater supplies. Coastal cities need plans to keep people safe from storms and rising seas. And more. \"Adaptation saves lives,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said with the report's release. \"As climate impacts worsen \u2013 and they will \u2013 scaling up investments will be essential for survival... Delay means death.\" The report is the latest in a series by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) detailing the latest global consensus on climate science. This report, however, focuses on how nature and societies are being affected and what they can do to adapt.\u00a0 On nearly all counts, the report makes clear that climate change is impacting the world far faster than scientists had anticipated. Meanwhile, countries have failed to rein in planet-warming carbon emissions, which continue to rise. \"Unchecked carbon pollution is forcing the world's most vulnerable on a frogmarch to destruction,\" Guterres said in a video address Monday. \"The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal.\" While governments need to drastically curb their emissions to prevent runaway global warming, they can also work to limit suffering by adapting to the conditions of a warmer world, the report says. That will take a lot of money - to finance new technologies and institutional support. Cities can invest in cooling areas to help people through heatwaves. Coastal communities may need new infrastructure or to relocate altogether. \"In terms of transformational adaptation, we can plan it and implement it now, or it'll be thrust upon us by climate change,\" said Kristina Dahl, a climate expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was not involved in writing the report. But in some cases, the report acknowledges, the costs of adapting will be too high. The report's release three months after global leaders met at a climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, highlighted the urgency of efforts to contain global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of pre-industrial temperatures. Breaching that threshold will deliver irreversible damage to the planet, it says. And every increment of warming will cause more pain.\u00a0 \"Adaptation is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. There are limits to adaptation,\" said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and a report co-author. \"We should reduce greenhouse gas emissions because if we don't, it's going to get really bad.\" Limiting global warming to close to 1.5C may not prevent losses to nature, societies or economies, but will substantially reduce them, the report says. Having already warmed 1.1C, the planet is expected to hit the 1.5C threshold within two decades. Societies will fail to adjust well to a warming world if they aren't socially inclusive in tackling the task, the report warns. Solutions need to consider social justice and include indigenous populations, minorities and the poor, it says. \"It's the poor and most marginalized who are most vulnerable,\" said Timon McPhearson, an urban ecologist at The New School in New York and one of the report's 270 authors. That includes people living in developing countries in Africa, South Asia and small island nations, as well as marginalized communities in wealthy nations such as the United States. Without inclusive economic development in Africa, for example, climate change is expected to push 40 million more people into extreme poverty by 2030. Providing social welfare or jobs that also protect the environment - for example uprooting invasive trees that deplete water supplies - can go a long way towards helping vulnerable populations, said report co-author Christopher Trisos, a climate risk researcher at the University of Cape Town.\u00a0 But time is running out to make the society-wide transformations needed, the authors warn. The decisions society makes in the next decade will set the climate path to come. \"There is a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future on the planet,\" said Hans-Otto Portner, co-chair of the IPCC working group that generated the report. \"We need to live up to this challenge.\" Reuters", "headline": "United Nations major reports warns climate change upon us, humanity is far from ready", "article_name": "united-nations-major-reports-warns-climate-change-upon-us-humanity-is-far-from-ready", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2022/03/united-nations-major-reports-warns-climate-change-upon-us-humanity-is-far-from-ready.html", "date_published": "2022-03-01 05:43:54", "article_length": 4719, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:52.867099"}

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images Tiny fragments of plastic floating in the air have been directly linked to climate change for the first time. A new study out of the University of Canterbury has found airborne microplastics behave similarly to greenhouse gases. The study's lead author Laura Revell says these pieces of plastic are \"like little disco balls reflecting light\". \"Microplastics have a small cooling effect by scattering sunlight out to space and they also have a small warming effect by absorbing some of the radiation emitted by the Earth, similar to how greenhouse gases behave.\" University of Canterbury PhD student Alex Aves says the pieces of plastic can come from many places. \"Things like paint when [the] paint comes off buildings, that's often acrylic-based and so is plastic, also fibres, that can be anything that sheds off your clothes, anything that is a non-natural fibre.\" Plastic degrades through aging and exposure to light to produce microplastics - and they remain in the Earth's atmosphere for years. \"We looked at how microplastic and fibres interact with light and we put that information into a climate model to simulate the effect that microplastics have on the overall climate balance,\" Revell says. She adds the current concentration of microplastics in the atmosphere is low, so their influence on climate is small - but that could change. \"Our calculations show that a 100-fold increase on microplastic concentration today would mean microplastics would have a similar climate influence to other types of aerosols.\" Five billion tonnes of plastic waste that has built up in landfills is projected to double over the next 30 years.\u00a0 While we may not see the plastic particles, we might soon see the damage they can do.", "headline": "Airborne microplastics directly linked to climate change for first time by University of Canterbury researchers", "article_name": "airborne-microplastics-directly-linked-to-climate-change-for-first-time-by-university-of-canterbury-researchers", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/10/airborne-microplastics-directly-linked-to-climate-change-for-first-time-by-university-of-canterbury-researchers.html", "date_published": "2021-10-21 18:39:15", "article_length": 1853, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:53.045586"}

Credits: Video: Newshub  Image: Getty The Government has announced the funding of eight new research projects to help farmers understand and mitigate the effects of climate change. \n In July, the Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC) suggested that farming be  included in the Emissions Trading Scheme  in an effort to curb agriculture emissions. Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said the slew of new research projects would support farmers introducing more sustainable on-farm practices. \"New Zealand is a world leader of research to reduce emissions in the agriculture sector. The latest projects will help researchers, government and farmers better understand and adapt to the effects of climate change,\" he said. The $1.56 million for eight new projects is provided through the Ministry for Primary Industries' (SLMACC) and include: -$500,000 for Landcare Research and AgResearch to develop practical actions that farmers can take to adapt to climate change.\u00a0 -$150,000 for the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre (NZAGRC) to help rural advisors boost climate change knowledge.\u00a0 -$140,000 for NIWA to develop better tools to measure and assess drought conditions.\u00a0 Damien O'Connor said the funding came on top of the $229 million investment made in the farming sector through the sustainable land use package. \"SLMACC has funded over 150 projects over the last 10 years, to the tune of approximately $50 million. In Budget 2019, we also invested $8.5 million to further our work with the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases (GRA).'' Climate Change Minister James Shaw welcomed the new research projects. \"Farmers know better than most about the effects of climate change and many are innovating so that they can drive down on-farm emissions,\" he said.\u00a0 \"In being the best possible steward of the earth, farmers contribute towards leaving a safe planet for our kids and grandkids. The research being funded today will help them get there,\" said Shaw. The  ICCC recommended in July  developing a fund, led by farming leaders, to build the skills and technologies farmers would need to measure and manage their on-farm emissions. It's estimated that could provide a fund of $47 million a year which would be 100 percent recycled back into fitting out farmers and growers with the measurement tools and know-how to control farm emissions through a processor levy over the next five years, which would eventually lead to farmers handling emissions at the farm-gate by 2025. Farmers would receive a 95 percent discount on emissions in line with similar discounts for other industries. Farming leaders  want an alternative sector-led proposal,  which it would manage, to get the agricultural sector into an emissions pricing system by 2025. Under the proposal, it would be funded through the sector's levy organisations, including Federated Farmers, Dairy NZ, and NZ Beef and Lamb.

{"id": null, "body": "New Zealand will unveil a more ambitious emissions reduction target at the next United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Climate Change Minister James Shaw has revealed.\u00a0\u00a0 Our current target , as agreed in the 2015 Paris Accords, is reducing emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. This in order to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5C above the pre-industrial average, considered by most scientists as the threshold of ecological disaster.\u00a0 \n \"Earlier this year, the Climate Change Commission said our target was not adequate for a 1.5C world,\" Shaw told Newshub Nation.\u00a0\u00a0 \"So they have instructed us to come up with something a bit stronger now. Keep in mind the Cabinet hasn't made a decision on that yet, but you know, we will obviously be doing that before I go to COP26.\" This could mean the societal changes proposed in the  draft emissions reduction plan released this week  are only the beginning. The proposals include cheaper public transport, a ban on food waste in landfills and tax incentives for clean cars, among many other ideas.\u00a0 Shaw stressed this is not the final version but a consultation document which will inform the complete plan, due next year, setting the roadmap for our climate action through to 2035.\u00a0 \"The Government by itself isn't going to be able to do this. Most of the pollution occurs in our industrial sector, so we've got to work with them on proposals for how they can reduce their emissions.\" Critics have blasted the draft proposals for not tackling agriculture - our largest emitter by far - and instead focusing mostly on sectors like transport. Shaw says the agricultural emissions will be dealt with but addressed separately.\u00a0 \"This is not the only input into the final plan. We have the He Waka Eke Noa, which is a partnership between the government and the agricultural sector. They are intending to go out to consultation over the summer with their proposals for how to price and reduce agricultural emissions very shortly.\"\u00a0 Under the He Waka Eke Noa Primary Sector Climate Action Partnership, the Government will start taxing agriculture emissions from 2025 - but the sector will get a 95 percent discount.\u00a0 Greenpeace, headed by former Green Party leader Russel Norman, slammed the lack of aggressive action on agriculture as 'udder bullshit'. Other critics, including ACT Party Leader David Seymour, attacked the Climate Change Minister for  extending the deadline on delivering  the emission reduction plan. Originally due this year, the final plan will now arrive alongside the next Budget in May 2022.\u00a0 Shaw says he understands the pushback but blames Delta disruption.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It is urgent and I don't want to push it six months further down the road. But ultimately we had a Delta outbreak that meant that we had to adjust our plans, and that's just a function of the world that we live in at the moment.\" Whatever emissions reduction commitment New Zealand reveals at COP26, it is unlikely to match the ambition of some of our closest allies. The UK is targeting a 78 percent emission reduction target by 2035 and have already reduced their emissions by 48 percent since 1990. New Zealand, meanwhile, is heading in the opposite direction. Between 1990 and 2019, our gross emissions increased by 26 percent. When pressed on whether he should be doing more, Shaw was open about his frustration. \"If you look back over the 30 years that we have known about the climate crisis and the effects of the climate crisis, our greenhouse gas emissions and our policy response has gone in precisely the wrong direction. But while he acknowledged the trend is dire, the Climate Change Minister says once the final plan is in place it will be a substantial step in the right direction.\u00a0 \"This is the first time that we are going to have a legally binding plan that touches every part of the public sector, every part of the Government.. And when we publish it next year, what you will see is that it is a plan that hits those targets for the next five, 10 and 15 years.\"\u00a0\u00a0 COP26 will begin on October 31 and run until Friday November 12, in Glascow.

Credits: Video - The AM Show; Image - Getty Images Global governments' plans to cut emissions in the years ahead are not enough to avert catastrophic climate change which would lead to \"endless suffering\", a UN report said on Monday. With less than a week until the United Nations COP26 conference begins, the report laid bare the gap between the actions governments are taking today, and what would be needed to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement target to try to limit human-caused global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. \"Overshooting the temperature goals will lead to a destabilised world and endless suffering, especially among those who have contributed the least to the (greenhouse gas) emissions in the atmosphere,\" said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Under countries' current pledges, global emissions would be 16 percent higher in 2030 than they were in 2010, according to an analysis by the UNFCCC. That is far off the 45 percent reduction by 2030 that scientists say is needed to cap warming at 1.5 degrees and avoid its most devastating impacts like the deadly heat waves and destructive storms already battering countries around the world. \"We are nowhere near where science says we should be,\" Espinosa said. Without more ambitious commitments, global temperatures could hit 2.7 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, the UNFCCC said. The warning came as a separate World Meteorological Organization report showed that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere surged to 413.2 parts per million in 2020, rising more than the average rate over the last decade despite a temporary dip in new emissions during COVID-19 lockdowns. read more \"We are way off track,\" said Secretary-General Petteri Taalas on prospects for meeting the Paris cap. \"We need to revisit our industrial, energy and transport systems and whole way of life,\" he added, calling for a \"dramatic increase\" in commitments at COP26 which runs from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. read more The reports on Monday emphasised the high stakes for the COP26 conferences, where world leaders and thousands of delegates will attempt to secure pledges from countries and enough action from polluters to keep the Paris goals alive. Scientists say capping global warming to 1.5 degrees would require global net emissions of CO2 - the main greenhouse gas - to fall to zero by 2050. The UNFCCC said it had received a flurry of new climate pledges in the last month, and that as of Oct. 12 some 143 of the nearly 200 countries that signed the Paris agreement had submitted new pledges. Most of the pledges received in recent weeks were from small countries responsible for a tiny share of global emissions, however, while submissions from bigger polluters like Saudi Arabia had not moved the needle for emissions over the next decade. read more The European Union and United States - the world's second and third-biggest emitters after China - also set new targets this year to reduce emissions this decade. China and India are among those facing pressure to commit to cut emissions faster. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to rise for as long as countries keep putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than they can remove. Emissions, which fluctuate depending on the current level of fossil-fuel burning, are distinct from the carbon dioxide concentrations accumulated over centuries. The WMO report confirmed that last year's temporary dip in emissions \"did not have any discernible impact on the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases and their growth rates.\" Concentrations of other gases methane and nitrous oxide also rose in 2020 and beat the last decade's average, it showed. It also flagged concerns about the ability of the ocean and trees to soak up roughly half of carbon dioxide levels, thus protecting us against potentially more dramatic temperature hikes. \"It's not automatic that the strength of sinks will continue at the same rate,\" said Taalas, describing \"alarming\" new data showing that a portion of the Amazon rainforest was now emitting carbon rather than absorbing it due to deforestation and fires.

New Zealand King Salmon had one in five of its salmon die last summer, prompting an increased focus on how to future-proof its business. Salmon swim in aerated water to keep conditions cool, and are fed a nutritious diet to combat conditions, chief executive Grant Rosewarne said. \"If we do that, it lowers stress and they can cope with the higher temperatures better,\" he said. Last summer's mortality rate was more than double the year before, at 8 percent. \"In the wild maybe only 3 [percent] would actually survive,\" Mr Rosewarne said. \"We're trying to turn that around and in a good year 95 percent will survive, and in a bad year, 80 percent.\" According to NIWA, high pressure over the Tasman Sea last summer prevented the mixing of cool deeper ocean water with surface water, meaning the ocean water was abnormally warm. NZ King Salmon are taking the lead of companies in other countries like Norway and looking to farm in the open ocean. \"The water is deeper, it's colder, the currents are flowing faster so they are better conditions,\" Mr Rosewarne said.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty All but 1 percent of Australia's Great Barrier Reef could be destroyed within the next four years if the Earth continues tracking at its current rate of warming, a new report has found. The study - released this week under the title  The Risks to Australia of a 3C Warmer World  - says between 70 and 99 percent of the corals could be doomed unless \"transformative action\" is taken to reverse current trends. Australian Academy of Science researchers explored the risks to Australia's future based on the current global rate of greenhouse gas emissions, and found net-zero emissions by 2050 should be seen as an \"absolute minimum\" requirement. They say the target set in the Paris Climate Accord - to limit global warming to just 1.5C - is now \"virtually impossible\", and that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed if temperatures go beyond that point. At 1.5C of warming, the reef is set to shrink by 70 to 90 percent, while at 2C, just 1 percent of the corals would remain. Current trends show the Earth is set to surpass the 1.5C mark by 2025. But there is still hope; researchers found that if temperatures were to stabilise, the surviving corals could expand to cover the reef again. If they were to continue to go up, however, seaweeds would soon take over. \"It's questionable that this would produce the $5 billion in income the reef now produces in tourism,\" study co-author Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg  told the  Sydney Morning Herald .

{"id": null, "body": "\n By Arthur Max The first time Araceli Bastida Be heard the phrase \"climate change\" was on TV two years ago. Then she began to understand why strange things had been happening in her village. Tabi was in its second year of drought, and the corn that sustains the village was left stunted on the stalks. Farmers couldn't bear the midday heat anymore, and were in their fields at dawn in order to finish before noon. After a 1km walk from school, Bastida Be's son would return home with headaches. Summer nights were too hot to sleep until after midnight. And winters were so cold the villagers had to buy blankets. A year earlier, Hurricane Dean reached deep into Mexico's rain forest, destroying Tabi's beehives and blowing down several thatched-roof homes. \"We don't know what's going on. All we know is that something has changed,\" says Bastida Be, 31, who tends her own corn crop while her husband is away working in construction jobs on the coast. In Cancun, a resort 250km to the north, world governments are grappling with Tabi's problems. A 193-nation climate conference is debating measures to restrain emissions of carbon and other gases that are causing the Earth's temperatures to rise. They also are discussing how to help people like Tabi's 400 residents adjust their lives to new conditions. But the subsistence farmers of Tabi can't wait. Their traditional haphazard practices, rooted in 2,500 years of Mayan culture, can no longer produce enough to feed them. The rainfall at the start of planting season, which once could be predicted almost to the day, is now unreliable. If the rain doesn't come within four days of planting, the farmers have to start all over, as they did last year, losing an entire season's worth of seed. The hot weather has reduced yield by 50 to 60 percent over the past 15 years, according to Mexico's department of rural development, culminating in 2009 with the worst drought in 60 years. Scientists say average global temperatures have been rising markedly, with each of the past three decades hotter than the previous. The villagers say they began to notice about 10 years ago that days were warmer and trees were not flowering as they used to. This year, in a further sign of the erratic conditions, the spring rains returned to Tabi in a deluge: nearly 350mm in the planting month of May, about 10 times more than last year. At the same time, the Mexican government, concerned about deforestation, has tightened regulations on harvesting wood from virgin rain forest, even though the villagers say they are already carefully managing the forest. Normally, the villagers clear a field with a slash-and-burn method. They work a plot of a few dozen square metres for two years until the soil grows tired, then move on, leaving the ground fallow for at least eight years to recover. As with most Mayan villages, the land belongs to everyone, and each family can have as much as it is willing to clear and farm. \"Thirty years ago my grandfather worked two hectares (5 acres). Now we need five for the same amount of food. That's how we measure the difference,\" Candelario De Pat, 64, told a small group of visiting reporters in a field with stalks reaching 4 metres high. Four years ago Victoria Santos, of the non-profit Organisation of Mayan Forest Producers, began visiting Tabi and other villages to spread the news that the weather won't improve. Global warming will only worsen, she tells them, and they need to modernise their farming. She showed them how to clear their fields of stones, uproot tree stumps and roots, dig furrows and plant in rows to trap and conserve water, and to plant the most drought-resistant varieties. Today, side-by-side fields using the new and old methods show that even such basic methods produce a dramatic difference. Tabi has made a small but significant move in what climate specialists call \"adaptation\" - adjusting their lives to the changing conditions of a warming world. \"They've chosen to make changes and do things differently, and that's what's needed to confront the challenge of climate change,\" said Antonio Hill of the Oxfam charity group, which organised the trip to Tabi. \"Adaptation is about simple measures to handle the changes that are happening now and what's coming down the line.\" During two decades of talks, climate negotiators have focused on how to stop carbon emissions from growing and feeding into the planet's warming cycle. Increasingly, though, more attention is being paid to adapting to changes that already have become evident. Last year, industrial countries pledged US$30 billion in emergency funds through 2012 to help poor countries prepare for climate change, and promised to raise US$100 billion a year starting in 2020. Developing countries say at least half of those funds should go to adaptation measures, and the other half toward helping their economies shift to low-carbon growth. The people of Tabi are cash poor, but not impoverished. Their village, immaculately clean, has an elementary school, a cement basketball-volleyball court and a gazebo where public events are held. Their homes are simple, and most have gardens of vegetables, legumes and fruit trees with chickens running free. But the villagers' staple is corn. Tortillas are served at every meal.

It's the latest protests in a worldwide movement sparked by Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg. Participants of all ages have demonstrated across New Zealand, with protests beginnning in Wellington at 11am, Auckland\u00a0at 12pm and Christchurch at 1pm. Here's what you need to know: Refresh the page for the latest live updates. 3:49pm -\u00a0 The dispersing crowds in Auckland were told to continue taking the message with them.\u00a0 Thousands of students against climate change marched from Aotea Square, before blocking the entrance to the Ports of Auckland on Quay Street.\u00a0 Climate scientist Jacob Anderson was encouraged by the action. \"The tide is starting to turn - look at what has been achieved in one year,\" he told the crowd. \"Don't underestimate the power movements like this will have to drive the transformation needed in the next decade.\" 3:47pm -  Climate Change Minister \u00a0 James Shaw says people must continue to pressure politicians. 3:40pm -\u00a0 Local politicians and hopefuls joined a sea of climate protestors marching through Christchurch on Friday afternoon. Lincoln University student Isabella Hardy said was at the protest because she's passionate about the environment. \"It's really important for us to protect our land, our ocean, [and] our earth,\" she told Newshub. 3:30pm -\u00a0 National's Nick Smith told the Wellington protestors it's about creating the right adaption plan. \"The reality is the change is tougher and greater on our Pacific friends.\" 2:55pm -\u00a0 Most strikers have now moved on from Queen St, but earlier in the day the main Auckland street was chocker with protesters. 2:40pm -\u00a0 The Taxpayers' Union's mascot is at the climate strike calling for a \"tax emergency\" to be declared. 2:30pm -\u00a0 While the strike is officially over in Auckland, many continue to protest, chanting: \"What do we want? Climate justice. When do we want it? Now.\" A large #ProtectIhum\u0101tao banner can also be seen at Britomart. Those in Christchurch are sending a similar message, chanting: \"Climate action, now.\" 2:10pm -\u00a0 National's agriculture spokesperson Todd Muller is calling for James Shaw, David Parker and Damien O'Connor to reject a message being expressed at a protest at Parliament. Signs read: \"Help farmers phase out animal farming.\" Muller says: \"This is why NZ farmers feel like your Govt is a megaphone of rural criticism.\" 2pm -\u00a0 The School Strike 4 Climate NZ Twitter account claims 170,000 people are striking. 1:55pm -\u00a0 Auckland Transport says the strike in Auckland has moved away from Queen St and is now \"blocking Quay St between Tangihua St and Tapora St\".\u00a0 1:45pm -\u00a0 Greta Thunberg, whose remarks at the UN this week about a lack of urgency around climate changed captured global attention, has shown support for the Kiwi protests, retweeting pictures from across the country. 1:40pm -\u00a0 Strikes aren't only happening in the main cities, but also in some towns across New Zealand. Here's some pictures from New Plymouth. There are about 600 people marching here, according to protester Ethan Griffiths. 1:30pm -  Phil Goff was spotted at the protest, or at least one of his election hoardings was. \n The Mayor shared a photo of two protesters holding the hoarding and joked the signs are \"biodegradable and multi-purpose\". 1:20pm -  Photos from above show the scale of the Auckland protest, which stretches from Aotea Square to Shortland St. 1:10pm -  A huge crowd has gathered outside Parliament.\u00a0\u00a0\"I can't believe I'm protesting for facts,\" one of the signs reads. You can read Newshub's list of the sassiest signs at the strike  here. 1:07pm -  Protesters have arrived in Christchurch. Newshub reporter Emily O'Connell says there are a couple thousand people gathered in the square. 12:40pm -  Auckland protest organiser Luke Wijohn also presented to the group, lashing out at the Government, which he said allows overfarming and the continuous rise of emissions. \"This is our country... It is being controlled by the exploiters, by the colonisers and by the polluters. \"Today we make a stand! Today we draw the line!\" 12:25pm -  Ihum\u0101tao protest leader Pania Newton addressed the crowd in Auckland, standing in front of a sign that calls climate inaction \"pacific genocide\". \"I am here today to remind Government that they need to take into account indigenous values when making decisions about our future and our climate.\" 12:10pm -  A lone climate change denier has arrived at the Christchurch protest, which will begin in a little under an hour. 11:50am -  Meanwhile, things are a bit quieter in Christchurch where the protest doesn't start until 1pm. Set-up is underway but protesters are yet to arrive. 11:38am -  Protesters have filled Aotea Square in Auckland central. Many of them are carrying signs, some of them painted with jokes while others say the planet is in serious danger. \"You'll die of old age, we'll die of climate change,\" one says. \"Protect the planet like Mike Hosking protects his white privilege,\" another one says. \u00a0 11:05am -  The crowd in Wellington is growing as protesters arrive in Civic Square. Photos posted to Twitter show groups of people with signs, while giant hand sculpture Quasi watches from above. 10:50am -  Kids are already thinking about how they're going to get to the protest in an environmentally friendly way. Bike Auckland posted a picture of the Point Chevalier Bike Train on Twitter, which will use pedal power to get to the protest in Auckland's CBD. 9:45am -  Protesters have already begun assembling. Video posted to Facebook group Vic Deals shows a group of protesters practising chants outside Lower Hutt's The Dowse Art Musem. \"No more coal, no more oil, keep your carbon in the soil,\" the group shouts. They also practice one the ringleader refers to as \"the classic\". \"What do we want?\" she shouts to the crowd. \"Climate justice!\" they respond. 9:10am -  Protest leaders have spoken to media in advance of the demonstrations, including  dropping in to The AM Show  to explain their goals and why they support Greta Thunberg. Auckland protest organiser Luke Wijohn even got to meet National MP Judith Collins, although he doesn't look very happy about it in a photo of the meeting she posted on her Twitter. Collins told The AM Show she thinks the protests are a \"generational thing\" and the future youth will have something else to worry about. \"My generation, we were really worried about nuclear war... I do think we've just got to let them do what they want to do.\"\u00a0 Labour Party MP Willie Jackson said the kids need to calm down. \"Sometimes young ones have got to just have a relax, have a good time too.

It prompted Greenpeace executive director Russel Norman to criticise the Zero Carbon Act.\u00a0 \"From what we hear [the Government] will be setting emission reduction targets thirty years away, overseen by a climate commission with no powers to enforce the targets. This is not an approach that is consistent with the urgency of the climate emergency,\" he said.\u00a0 \"The world now has just a decade to cut carbon emissions in half to avoid climate catastrophe.

He said ways of cutting emissions - such as electrification of bus fleets - \"are still missing\".\u00a0 He said the most staggering sector is international aviation. He pointed to international figures that showed emissions rose 362,000 tonnes - or 11 percent - in a single year, and are now up 178 percent on 1990 levels.\u00a0 The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has warned that building replacement costs from climate change in New Zealand could total $19 billion.\u00a0 And Auckland Council recently released its climate change risk assessment that said nearly one quarter of the region's buildings - over 127,000 buildings - are exposed to flood hazards.

{"id": null, "body": "Related video: Climate Change Commission releases draft plan on New Zealand reaching zero emissions.  Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images By Susan J. Prichard, Keala Hagmann, and Paul Hessburg for The Conversation After so many smoke-filled summers and record-setting burns, residents of Western North America are no strangers to wildfires. Still, many questions are circulating about  why forest fires are becoming larger and more severe  \u2013 and what can be done about it. Is climate change fueling these fires? Does the long history of fighting every fire play a role? Should we leave more fires to burn? What can be done about Western forests\u2019 vulnerability to wildfires and climate change? We invited 40 fire and forest ecologists living across the Western US and Canada to examine the latest research and answer these questions in a  set of studies  published Aug. 2, 2021. Collectively, we are deeply concerned about the future of Western forests and communities under climate change. So, why are wildfires getting worse? Climate change is a big part of it. Summer wildfire seasons are  already 40 to 80 days longer  on average than they were  30 years ago . Annual  droughts are more pronounced , making it easier for fuels to dry out and fires to ignite and spread. Extreme weather events, marked by dry fuels,  lightning storms  and strong winds, are also  increasingly common  and provide essential ingredients for rapid fire growth, as witnessed by the  Bootleg Fire   burning in Oregon  and record-setting fires in  California  and  Colorado  in 2020. Ironically, a chronic lack of fire in Western landscapes also contributes to increased fire severity and vulnerability to wildfires. It allows dry brush and live and dead trees to build up, and with more people living in wildland areas to spark blazes, pressure to fight every forest fire has increased the risk of extreme fire. Historically, fire was a regular visitor to most Western forests, except moist locations like those along the Pacific Northwest coast and in British Columbia. Frequent or periodic fires from Indigenous burning and lightning strikes created patchworks of grasslands, shrublands and regenerating forests of all ages. Past fires influence the way subsequent fires burn and what they leave behind. For example,  Indigenous burning practices  not only enhance cultural resources and wildlife habitat but also  reduce the amount and connectedness of fuels  that drive large, severe wildfires. Similarly, patchy burns from lightning ignitions create forest landscapes that are less likely to burn all at once. The US and Canada effectively suppress all but  2-3 percent of wildfire starts . However, this small percentage of fires burn at the height of each fire season, when dry conditions and extreme fire weather thwart even the most aggressive attempts to suppress them. Unintentionally, by focusing on short-term risks of wildfires, the US is predisposing forests to burn under the very worst conditions. Active fire suppression contributes to what is often referred to as the  wildland fire paradox  \u2013 the more we prevent fires in the short term, the worse wildfires become when they return. In one of the new studies,  Paul Hessburg  and co-authors explain how fire managers can mitigate the severity of future fires by managing fire-excluded forests to foster resilience to wildfires and drought.  Management approaches  include thinning dense forests, reducing fuels through prescribed burning and managing wildfires to restore more typical patterns of forests, meadows, shrublands and woodlands. In a second paper,  Keala Hagmann  and her co-authors describe how more than a century of fire exclusion and past forest management practices have  jeopardized forest biodiversity and social and ecological values , including  culturally important resources , the quantity and quality of water, stability of carbon stores, recreation and air quality. For example, fire exclusion has compromised aspen stands \u2013  biodiversity hot spots  for everything from bears to butterflies. Increased forest cover diverts water from downslope meadows, allowing conifer forests to further encroach on aspen habitat. Amid the daunting reality of climate change and severe wildfires, there is a path forward for Western forests. In a third article,  Susan Prichard  and her co-authors examine which  adaptive forest management approaches  have worked to increase resilience to wildfires and climate change. There is strong scientific evidence that fuel reduction treatments \u2013 including forest thinning, prescribed burning, Indigenous cultural burning and managed wildfires \u2013 are effective approaches for mitigating future fire impacts to Western forests. However, land managers can\u2019t expect these treatments to work if they are applied to only a small fraction of Western forest landscapes. When combined, forest thinning and prescribed burning in dry ponderosa pine and in dry and moist mixed-conifer forests have been shown to be highly effective at reducing the fire damage to forests. However, this type of treatment is not appropriate for all forest types. Fire managers in some wilderness areas and national parks have allowed fires started by lightning to burn in some wind and weather conditions. Over the past 40-plus years, these wildfires have been allowed to burn and reburn landscapes, generally  limiting the size and severity of subsequent wildfires . Given the immense diversity of Western forests, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, in forests that historically supported more frequent fire, revitalizing and continuing cultural burning practices, prescribed burning, and forest thinning combined with prescribed burning can reduce overcrowding and the potential for severe fires. Thinning and prescribed burning  aren\u2019t appropriate or feasible  everywhere. In reality, only a portion of landscapes can be treated this way. Allowing wildfires to burn in more areas under moderate weather conditions is also part of the solution. Promoting resilient Western forests will require that our society builds a new relationship with fire by creating fire-adapted communities and looking for opportunities to restore fire to Western forest landscapes. In this era of warmer, drier summers and longer fire seasons, there are no fire- or smoke-free solutions. The current approach to fire management poses unnecessarily high stakes for Western forests. There is no doubt that the future of Western forests is a fiery one. How we choose to live with fire is still up to us.

{"id": null, "body": "By Robin Martin of RNZ A groundbreaking school that puts a green ethos at the centre of its learning is celebrating its opening in Taranaki today. Green School New Zealand has a focus on sustainability, but it doesn't come cheap with enrolment and tuition fees costing up to $40,000 for some overseas students. Three alien-looking pods or 'waka' emerging out farmland southwest of New Plymouth are a giveaway you've arrived at Green School New Zealand. Built out of sustainable New Zealand pine and heat-treated in the UK they are designed to be thermally neutral and to blend into the environment. Green School New Zealand chief executive Chris Edwards said the pods were representative of what the school was all about. \"These are curved buildings. They're a unique design and, if it doesn't seem too fanciful, I see them as almost a metaphor actually for the young mind. \"The young mind isn't linear. It isn't boxed. It's not contained. Why do we teach people in square rooms? \"So what we are trying to do here I suppose to an extent is actually mirror what goes on in a young person's mind. \"It's querying, you know, it's a free mind. The lightfall here, the undulations of the scenery, the shadow etc.\" Based on Green School Bali, Edwards said the goal of the school - which had about 50 students enrolled - was to prepare young people for the 21st century. \"So we take as our starting point areas like the United Nation's sustainable development goal, permaculture, principles of the sustainability compass and we use those, if you like, as the heart of the curriculum. \"So instead of starting with your maths, your physics and chemistry they all tuck in under much bigger concepts.\" Edwards said subjects such as maths and te reo would be mapped against the New Zealand curriculum and students at the Green School would be able to graduate with NCEA. He said the school hoped to eventually accommodate 500 students from Year 1 through Year 13 - half of whom would come from overseas. Brazilian couple Elisa Roorda and Flavio Vianna had enrolled their daughters Nina and Sofia. Roorda said they were won over immediately. \"We came to visit the Green School and we just loved it. The whole family. The kids asked us to stay here. \"We were planning to go back to Brazil in January and go back to our lives and then we said 'no lets stay here and have a new life here in New Zealand.\" Roorda said they were attracted by the school's values and its location. Even the price tag was not off-putting. \"Well the public schools in Brazil they're not good schools so the people that have money they all go to private schools. \"So where we live in Brazil we all pay for school so what we are paying here is the same as there so for us it's not a difference.\" The Brazilian couple said the Green School helped get student visas for their daughters and they been granted visas as their guardians. Another person not regretting moving to New Zealand with his family to enrol at the school was 10-year-old Freddie Chambers. He transferred from the Hong Kong Academy. \"Well here is a lot more open space and it's like more in the countryside and Hong Kong's more like a city and a town and so right now it's less busy here and it's a really nice place.\" The Green School Bali is operated as a not-for-profit, but its New Zealand counterpart expects to eventually run surpluses. The Ministry of Education requires all private schools here to be registered and have regard to the statement of National Education and Learning Priorities. But they are not required to teach to the New Zealand Curriculum. The Green School New Zealand has provisional registration. When it is fully registered it will qualify for a per-student subsidy of up to $2300.

Hundreds marched down Auckland's Queen St before conducting a 'lie-in' which effectively blocked the road off from traffic.

There have been huge reports internationally, from the United Nations' (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), but also here in New Zealand with the Climate Commission launching its first blueprint to get our country to carbon zero by 2050. There have also been incentives to move to electric cars, with a rebate move from the Labour government, and of course the big climate change event of the year - COP26, held in Glasgow. Today  The Detail's  Jessie Chiang speaks to  Stuff's  climate change editor, Eloise Gibson, about how we're actually tracking in stopping emissions. \"We've certainly seen momentum in getting to the starting line of stopping climate change,\" she says. \"I wouldn't say we've made any actual progress on cutting emissions.\" New Zealand's own emissions have been hovering around 80 million tonnes a year for a while, but Gibson says the caps on spending proposed by the Climate Change Commission report this year were promising. The Commission proposes that between 2022 and 2025 the country cuts about five million tonnes of emissions every year, with potentially larger cuts after that. And scientists have never been more sure that humans are affecting the climate. The IPCC stated in its report that humans were \"unequivocally\" responsible for rising temperatures. Even in New Zealand, Gibson says a report by MetService and Victoria University found that the Canterbury floods this year were made worse by climate change. \"They were 10 to 15 percent more severe than they would have been without that one-ish degree of warming we've already seen, because hotter air holds more moisture and therefore it dumps more moisture,\" she says. Gibson talks about steps taken by the government this year, including work with the emissions trading scheme and the disappointing delay of its emissions reduction plan. \"The Government's given itself an extension until May next year and what we have instead is a draft plan,\" she says. \"In fact, it's not even a draft plan\u2026 it's a consultation document, essentially a series of bullet points.\" But Gibson is hopeful. \"I'm not actually as gloomy as some about how we've done this year\u2026 but obviously what we need now is to move at pace.\" RNZ", "headline": "Climate change: A lot of talk, less action in 2021 with huge reports and incentives, but little progress", "article_name": "climate-change-a-lot-of-talk-less-action-in-2021-with-huge-reports-and-incentives-but-little-progress", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/12/climate-change-a-lot-of-talk-less-action-in-2021-with-huge-reports-and-incentives-but-little-progress.html", "date_published": "2021-12-13 07:20:48", "article_length": 2464, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-18T05:45:57.246024"}

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images By Tim Newbold and Charlie Outhwaite for The Conversation \n The world may be facing a devastating \"hidden\" collapse in insect species due to the twin threats of climate change and habitat loss. University College London's (UCL)  Centre for Biodiversity & Environment Research  has carried out one of the largest-ever assessments of insect declines around the world - assessing three-quarters of a million samples from around 6000 sites. The new study, published in  Nature , finds that climate-stressed farmland possesses only half the number of insects, on average, and 25 percent fewer insect species than areas of natural habitat. Insect declines are greatest in high-intensity farmland areas within tropical countries - where the combined effects of climate change and habitat loss are experienced most profoundly. The majority of the world's estimated 5.5 million species are thought to live in these regions - meaning the planet's greatest abundance of insect life may be suffering collapses without us even realising. Lowering the intensity of farming by using fewer chemicals, having a greater diversity of crops and preserving some natural habitats can mitigate the negative effects of habitat loss and climate change on insects.

{"id": null, "body": "Watch: The government releases a proposed plan to determine how the country can adapt to climate change. \r\n  Credits: Newshub The Government is seeking feedback on its proposal for responding to climate change, with big questions around insurance, property transfer and who pays for it all.\u00a0 The draft National Adaptation Plan released on Wednesday  outlines the actions the Government will take over the next six years to respond to the priority climate-related risks identified in the 2020 National Climate Change Risk Assessment. Climate Change Minister James Shaw said events like the recent floods in Tairawhiti and fires in the Waituna wetlands in Southland demonstrate the case for urgent action on climate change. \"Central Government does not bear all the costs. The consultation asks how best to share risks and costs between property and asset owners, insurers, banks and local government as well,\" Shaw said.\u00a0 \"It also asks for views on managed retreat and flood insurance, to ensure a joined-up approach to climate change adaptation. \"Of course, the best thing we can do to stop these extreme weather events from getting worse is cutting the pollution we put into the atmosphere in the first place. Next month's Emissions Reduction Plan will set out how we plan to do that.\u00a0 \"However, we know that the climate is already changing and there will be some effects we cannot avoid. I urge all New Zealanders to read the plan and make a submission.\" Shaw, speaking to reporters, warned that if we don't address climate change now, it will inevitably lead to higher taxes because the money to respond to the challenges it creates has to come from somewhere.\u00a0 \"I need to emphasise that we are already paying for the cost and this is about reducing future liability. The cost is getting carried and those costs will increase and if we do nothing and we are just dealing with the effects of climate change via emergency response, then that is going to equate to an increase in taxes because that money has got to come from somewhere.\" Funding and financing is one of the important areas to deal with, Shaw said, but the Government is still gathering feedback on this. He said the costs right now are primarily falling on the Government in the form of disaster response management.  You can have your say by  submitting to Citizen Space , between April 28 and June 3.\u00a0 In the past 100 years, the climate has warmed by 1.1C and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that if Earth warms by 2C, hundreds of thousands of species could go extinct, natural environments would die and many coastal communities will be flooded out of existence. New Zealand is experiencing more hot days and fewer cold days, according to the Ministry for the Environment, with 2016 the warmest year on record.\u00a0\u00a0 Sea-level rise is continuing at a rate of 2.4 millimetres each year, which poses a severe adaptation challenge for New Zealand, with most of our major urban centres and population located on the coast or on floodplains of major rivers. If sea levels rise by half a metre, 36,000 buildings, 350 square kilometres of land and an extra 48,900 people would be exposed to flooding during extreme events - that's about the population of Nelson. Over the last 10 years, climate change related floods have cost the New Zealand economy at least $120 million for privately insured damages. Economic losses from droughts have cost a further $720 million. The Bay of Plenty town of Matat\u0101 is a prime example. Much of the town 24 kilometres to the north-west of Whakat\u0101ne was relocated between the years 2006 and 2021 due to increased natural threats arising from climate change.\u00a0 It has come at a total cost of approximately $16.8 million and has caused years of stress and uncertainty for the community. It required cooperation and funding from Whakatane District Council, Bay of Plenty Regional Council and central government. Given the scale of the issues - geographic, economic and social - the Government wants to step in and help but there are currently no dedicated tools or processes to guide how households or communities might permanently shift away from areas of intolerable risk. That's where the National Adaptation Plan comes into play. The draft National Adaptation Plan has three focus areas: The Government's response begins with its reform of the Resource Management Act (RMA),  the details of which were released in June last year .\u00a0 The Government announced plans to replace the clunky law blamed for holding back development due to its complexity, with three new laws this parliamentary term. The intention is to consolidate more than 100 RMA policy statements and regional district plans into about 14, simplifying national planning. The Natural and Built Environments Act (NBA) will be the primary replacement for the RMA. Below the NBA will sit the Strategic Planning Act (SPA) and the Climate Adaptation Act (CAA), to address complex issues associated with managed retreat. The CAA is intended to provide tools and processes to plan and implement managed retreats. For example, additional powers and processes will be needed to address issues of ownership of property that is withdrawn from.\u00a0 The Government is seeking feedback on how much it should intervene in managed retreat cases and how much central government should be involved.\u00a0 The Matat\u0101 experience highlighted the need for a national framework for managed retreat, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for individuals, central and local government, national direction and changes to existing land use protections.\u00a0 The Government is seeking feedback on property transfer and the implications that come with it, because managed retreat will require the transfer of land. While planning rules can prevent certain at-risk areas of land being built on, the Government will need to consider things like access, rates, and ongoing management of the land, including responsibility and liability for harm caused by structures left on the land or inadequate clean-up of existing soil contamination. The Government will also need to carefully consider M\u0101ori land acquired through Treaty settlement processes. Preventing the use of these lands could be viewed by M\u0101ori as land confiscation and a serious breach of Te Tiriti by the Crown.\u00a0 There's also insurance to consider. It plays an important role in supporting New Zealand's resilience and recovery from natural hazards. However, sea level rise and increasing extreme weather due to climate change are likely to affect the ability to insure assets, particularly residential buildings. This may lead to 'insurance retreat' in some cases, which could include higher premiums and ultimately loss of access to insurance. The Government has warned that insurers may limit their liability, or refuse future cover, if a property is highly likely to suffer similar damage again. Options for managed retreat may be limited if an insurer decides to manage repairs for a property.\u00a0 New Zealand's largest general insurer, IAG, has welcomed the draft National Adaptation Plan. \"Insurance is here to support kiwis when things go wrong, but there's so much more we need to be doing to keep New Zealanders safe from the impacts of natural disasters,\" said CEO Amanda Whiting. \"There are deliberate actions we can take to increase our resilience, alongside ongoing efforts to reduce carbon emissions. While we are pleased to see this important first step today, it's apparent there is still a lot we need to do as a country to get ahead of these issues and we welcome the opportunity to contribute to this plan. \"Insurance is one component of this solution. It is not the full answer.\u00a0 The most important thing we can do is to ensure people are not in harm's way.\u00a0 Avoiding the impact on lives and people's wellbeing must be the priority.\u00a0 \"This requires greater investment in infrastructure and other solutions that either protect people or move them out of harm's way. We can help achieve this alongside central and local government.\"", "headline": "Insurance, property transfer and who pays: Government seeks feedback on climate change managed retreat", "article_name": "insurance-property-transfer-and-who-pays-government-seeks-feedback-on-climate-change-managed-retreat", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2022/04/insurance-property-transfer-and-who-pays-government-seeks-feedback-on-climate-change-managed-retreat.html", "date_published": "2022-04-27 16:15:18", "article_length": 8072, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-29T07:41:28.685340"}

The report reiterated a rates increase is needed to ensure the council has enough money to reach its goals. A Natural Environment Targeted Rate has been proposed in the 2022/2023 Annual Budget, which is expected to create a $311 million fund over 10 years. \n This is in addition to the Climate Action Targeted Rate, which has also been proposed in the budget and will create $574m in a decade, to increase the number of buses, ferries, cycling and walking options in the city. \n Together, these would see a 5 percent annual rates increase across the city. \n Finances \n The report also warned the current annual rates cap may have to be reconsidered. \n Last year the council agreed to only put up annual rates by 3.5 percent for the next 10 years, but increased rates by 5 percent this year to account for Covid-19. \n The report stated the money coming in did not match how much the council had to spend. \n The council has already proposed another five percent increase in the 2022/2023 financial year and more is needed. \n It also proposes a $15m cost reduction through efficiency measures, such as recruitment controls, in the 2023/2024 financial year, which would grow to $30m per annum from 2024/2025 onwards. \n Inequality \n The report said more of the council's policies and investments needed to be prioritised for the communities that were the most vulnerable. More targeted climate change funding and pandemic recovery measures could also be allocated based on a priority scheme, it said. \n With Auckland house prices now around 10 times the average income, and the fourth most unaffordable in the world, the council should also look at increasing access to employment within each community. \n RNZ", "headline": "Climate change inequality and finances Auckland's main challenges council", "article_name": "climate-change-inequality-and-finances-auckland-s-main-challenges-council", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2022/04/climate-change-inequality-and-finances-auckland-s-main-challenges-council.html", "date_published": "2022-04-28 15:52:06", "article_length": 2729, "date_uploaded": "2022-04-29T07:41:48.747096"}
{"id": null, "body": "Related video: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks about the report on AM.  Credits: Newshub New Zealand cannot afford to put back everything that will be damaged by rising sea levels, the Climate Change Commissioner says, as new data shows an earlier risk of inundation than expected. The data shows the sea level is rising twice as fast as previously thought in some parts of Aotearoa, massively reducing the amount of time authorities have to respond. Globally the sea level is expected to rise about half a metre by 2100 - but for large parts of New Zealand it could more than double that because of land subsidence. The projections show infrastructure and homes in Auckland, Wellington and many other places risk inundation decades earlier than expected. In the capital, some areas will have a sea level rise of 30cm by 2040. Climate Change Commissioner Rod Carr said the science had been understood for decades. \"What is new here is the granularity of the science which shows what will happen where and when. \"We've known, now we need to act. \"We do have to make sure that every decision we make about where we build and where we restore infrastructure is seen through a climate change lens. \"We need to understand that New Zealand cannot afford to protect everything we have built and we cannot afford to put back everything that will be damaged.\" The government had put out a draft national adaptation plan and Parliament had some years ago put in place the architecture to help New Zealanders understand what needed to be done, he said. \"We need leaders who can lead and we need to support them in making hard decisions about where does the science tell us we need to spend our investment dollars. In parts of the country defences such as sea walls would be cost effective and appropriate and in others they will \"create false hope and wasted resources\". This was a \"massive challenge\" but the hope was independent scientific evidence can be used to make good choices. He believed there would be lower-lying communities where people would have to leave their homes within the next 30 years, and the challenge was to use the science and engineering to anticipate what will happen and act in advance. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the report gave detailed information of the impact of projected sea level rise on coastal parts of New Zealand. \"The reason that's really important for us, is to ensure that alongside local government, planning for the future, we are ensuring that infrastructure or decisions that are being made are taking into account the adaptation that will need be needed in in parts of New Zealand. \"The first port of call isn't necessarily the idea of managed retreat because there are a range of options that can be used.\" She said the first steps over the next few months would be working on the national adaptation plan \"and making sure that we are working alongside local government and insurers as we work through who bears the cost of some of these.\" \"We also should not accept that sea level rises going forward into the future are an inevitability, for instance, beyond those that have already been projected in the near term. We should be also making sure that we are doing our bit to do as much as we can to reduce the impacts of climate change.\" Local Government New Zealand president Stuart Crosby said retreating from sea level rise should be a last resort. \"We've been adapting for a very long time and the retreat should be very much a last option,\" he said. Referring to flood-damaged Matat\u0101 he said he and others had been going through a process on 25 to 27 homes in the Bay of Plenty \"and I can assure you it's a very traumatic experience for those residents\". Residents or their insurers could \"obviously\" not on their own pay for managed retreat, and nor could councils, so it had to be a collaborative effort. In Matat\u0101 it was the regional and local council and central government, but it was still an ad hoc approach and had to be a nationwide one. Eugene Doyle, who lives at \u014cwhiro Bay on Wellington's south coast and has been outspoken on the threat posed by the ocean, said communities needed access to better data to be part of the decision-making process. \"As of today we've got a little bit more knowledge about what's coming our way. \"There's a tremendous amount you can do to prepare communities - for example you can have far better warning systems.\" In some places, protection work would protect an entire length of coast - but it was important to understand where protection or retreat was needed in communities such as the south coast. \"If you judiciously spend money to harden up the most vulnerable points here, then a much larger community and the whole city gets to enjoy the south coast for a whole lot longer.\" Insurance Council chief executive Tim Grafton said there was an urgent need to look how to reduce the risk to homes in priority areas - whether it be changes to buildings or local infrastructure, or retreat. \"If we do nothing ... over time then insurance will price that risk,\" he said. \"We're not talking about sea level rise, we're talking about the combination of the sea gradually rising and then we have king tides and storms and flood events because the water table close to the beach is at sea level. \"Flood events occur a lot more easily in those circumstances. Grafton said housebuyers could use maps made available today to make a judgement on the risks. \"I'd have a look at that and make some judgements on whether or not I'm prepared to put up with sea level rise hitting my house in 20 or 30 years time ... when you risk manage you have to look at how you control the risk, how you avoid the risk ... and what level of risk we can transfer to insurance.\" Climate Change Minister James Shaw told Morning Report he wanted legislation to be introduced early next year on the national response to climate change supported by both sides of the House. \"I think this is one of those challenges that this country's facing that is too big for petty partisanship and for small time politics so I will be reaching out to the opposition to say how are we going to work our way through this.\" Decisions would have to be made by communities on what course of climate changte adaptation action made most sense for everybody who lived there. There would probably have to be some sort of dispute resolution, to mediate in communities on options, such as raising houses above flood levels, flood defences or moving people out of communities.

That's because just 30cm of sea-level rise is enough to incapacitate the town\u2019s stormwater system. \"The drainage system is designed for today but as sea level rises that drainage system stops functioning as it\u2019s been designed to function,\" Levy said. \"You get ponding behind the dunes, you get ponding in the streets, you get flooding that is perhaps something that most people aren't thinking about at the moment because it's out of sight, out of mind.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \n Under all the concrete and asphalt is a complex gravity-based drainage system that will need to be rethought and redesigned.

Whether people believe it's happening or not, the Wellington Regional Council is planning for it - and the cost to fix the underground stormwater pipes which keep Petone running will be eyewatering. \"When it comes to infrastructure buried in the ground like that we're talking tens to hundreds of millions of dollars,\" said Iain Dawe, a climate change and natural hazards specialist at the Wellington Regional Council. \"In all places like this where you have limited budgets, you have to start doing the cost/benefit calculations.\" Work has accelerated for a network of pipes that can cope with the rising sea and identify which areas will be hotspots - or wet spots - for flooding. \"But it may well be the case that we simply cannot afford to protect everywhere,\" Dr Dawe said. Eventually, some people will have to leave their homes and find drier, safer places to live.\u00a0 You might be thinking, 'Well I don\u2019t live in Petone or near the coast - so I'm fine.' But scientists say we don't get off the hook that easily.\u00a0 Even if the waves aren't lapping at your feet, they might be eroding a key piece of infrastructure near you. Eastbourne just around the Petone waterfront, for example, is relatively unscathed by sea-level rise - but the only road in and out is in big trouble.\u00a0 \"You may think you're living in an area that's resilient or protected from climate change that's not going to be directly affected by sea-level\u2026 but it might be that the road that you have to use to get to your house is highly exposed to the point where you can't actually get to the shops, your home to the hospital, your home to your place of work,\" Levy said.

So in a city where you can plant trees and have vertical gardens on buildings, have low-lying areas like some of the big parks\u2026 opened up for vegetation\u2026 so the ground becomes the sponge.\" It's an idea that could help Petone and the country's other low-lying areas adapt to sea-level rise.

{"id": null, "body": "By Hamish Cardwell RNZ Analysis - Climate Change Minister James Shaw will this morning sketch out roughly what will be in the government's plan to slash climate emissions. At about 8 am Shaw is to deliver a speech to an invited audience in Wellington. However, he will not set out specific policies that will be in the Emissions Reduction Plan - these will come when it is officially released sometime next week - about the time of this year's budget. The government has said climate and health will likely be a major focus of Budget 2022. In October last year, the government went to the public asking for ideas about how to make reductions, admitting it could not hit its targets without help. At best, its plans get Aotearoa two-thirds of the way to hitting the 2022-2025 target - and at worst are only a third of what's needed. The plan is a response to the Climate Change Commission's roadmap for how to get to net-zero emission by 2050. The government said it broadly accepts the commission's plan. It calls for progressively deeper emissions reductions - 15 percent by 2025 for long-lived greenhouse gases like CO2 - and up to 63 percent by 2035. Late last year the government made an international pledge to halve emissions by the end of the decade - although critics say once accounting tricks are taken into account they've really only committed to about 20 percent in reductions. Two-thirds of the savings will have to come from paying other countries to make cuts on our behalf. Transport likely to be an emphasis Emissions reductions in transport, energy and industry sectors will likely be a priority for the first emissions reduction period - from this year through to 2025. The scale and speed of the cuts needed to hit the targets are bracing. The commission said transport emissions must be slashed by 13 percent by 2030, and 41 percent by 2035. The discussion document released in October said the distance travelled by private vehicles must drop 20 percent by 2035. The emphasis will be on getting city dwellers out of their cars and into public transport, or walking and cycling if there is any hope of reaching the target. E-vehicles will need to make up 30 percent of the fleet by 2035. There will need to be a massive investment in mass transit in the large cities, with reduced public transport fees and increased congestion charging. The Ministry for the Environment pulled together a succinct table on the commission's advice to the government which shows the staggering scale of the changes needed. Some examples: Cyclists' numbers must increase by half in three years and by 340 percent by 2035 Public transport use needs to go up 60 percent and 210 percent over the same timeframes. By 2025, electricity generated from wind and solar needs to increase by 106 percent and 180 percent respectively. Meanwhile, the government's work phasing out fossil fuel boilers for industrial heat and decarbonising the industrial sector will continue. It intends to work towards a ban on organic material going into landfills without gas capture by 2030. But there are a raft of other plans in the works. There are few new plans for agriculture while work continues with the industry on the He Waka Eke Noa programme to cut emissions - with a decision expected by the end of the year. Most of the plans to cut climate gases have compounding positive benefits - they often lead to better health and environmental outcomes. The commission's modelled shows the cost to GDP in 2050 of reaching the net-zero target is a little over 1 percent, while doing nothing will cost about 2.3 percent. Critics argue that letting the emissions trading scheme drive innovation and efficiencies is the best and cheapest way to cut emissions. However, the commission and the IPCC say deeper cuts are needed if the world is to have any hope of limiting warming to below catastrophic levels.

M\u0101ori cultural sites will be among the most vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels. Of the almost 800 marae situated across Aotearoa, 80 percent are built on low-lying coastal land or flood-prone rivers. That means many M\u0101ori burial sites and plantations or food sources will be at risk. A total 191 marae are identified within 1 kilometre of the coastline, and new data released last weekend predicts for many coastal areas, a 30-centimetre sea level rise is coming in only 10 to 20 years. A PhD student has found that six marae already have one-in-100 year floods coming every year, while the same thing would happen at 16 others when sea level rise reaches between 10cm and 1 metre. Locals in the remote Far North community of Mitimiti are already feeling the impact of the sea level encroaching on their marae. M\u0101tihetihe Marae is situated behind sand dunes in Mitimiti north of the Hokianga Harbour. For 10-year-old Simone Manning, it's her turangawaewae, her ancestral home - but it's in danger of being washed away and she says it's not fair. \"You need us to have more of a say, let us rangatahi have a seat at the table when making decisions because we are most impacted by the choices made by older generations,\" she said. Simone can't imagine not having a marae in 50 years and said she doesn't want to bring children into this world in the future if we aren't serious about climate change. \"I can't drink or swim in the same water my grandparents bathed my mother in when she was a baby.\" Coastal marae like M\u0101tihetihe are increasingly at the mercy of rising tides and changing weather patterns.\u00a0 Last month, we saw part of an urup\u0101, or burial ground, at Hinetamatea Marae in Anaura Bay washed away after heavy rainfall across Tair\u0101whiti. In Auckland, tidal surges have flooded Maraetai and Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua ki \u014cr\u0101kei's urup\u0101 near Mission Bay. Back in Mititmiti, M\u0101tihetihe Marae spokesperson Ana Bercich said Cyclone Bola in 1988 got them thinking about the future. \"It ripped through this valley, the flooding came through our marae, and through our wharekai and so that was a wake-up call for us.\" In the last decade, the marae has been working with NIWA scientists on ways to adapt and wh\u0101nau have been coming up with their own solutions.\u00a0 One is an architect and drew up designs on transportable marae. \"She designed three pods for us so we can have those spaces and their removal and we can relocate them somewhere else,\" Bercich said. Moving away from areas that have been burial grounds and food sources for generations is a tough proposition for M\u0101ori. \"So these conversations illustrating, okay, your marae might be impacted, or you may have to move is a really hard pill to swallow,\" said Waikato University PhD student Akuhata Bailey-Winiata. Since two tectonic plates meet in the middle of Aotearoa, parts of the coast can sink quickly. Because of that, the global average sea-level rise of 30cm by 2060 is coming to parts of New Zealand in only 10 to 20 years. M\u0101tihetihe Marae is one of 191 marae across Aotearoa that is within 1km of the coast, and of these coastal marae 30 percent are situated below 10m above sea level.\u00a0 But now with the vertical land movement data, what this means for marae is really exactly how they are going to be affected. For example, the blue dots on one map on the New Zealand SeaRise Programme website indicate the mouth of the Hokianga harbour is sinking. White and pink dots further up the estuary suggest land movement will go up, but flooding could still have a big impact for marae and communities there. \"This information should help communities decide, 'Do I need to move this now? Or have I got a little bit more time than I thought. Well, if I got less time than I thought, and if we're going to relocate or shift, where should we put it so that it's future proof?',\" said NZ SeaRise Study co-lead Professor Richard Levy. Activist Mike Smith is currently taking New Zealand's biggest carbon emitters to the Supreme Court. He's also in charge of climate change policy for the Iwi Leaders Chair Forum. He said M\u0101ori will have a team working directly with the Ministry for the Environment on the Government's national adaptation plan to deal with the impacts of climate change.\u00a0 \"We're going to be setting that up over the next month or two. That's going to be empowering communities by providing full-time positions for climate navigators and each of those communities to start doing the assessments to working with those communities,\" he said. \"Because it's really important that we own the problems, and that we understand that there are real problems.\" Real problems already known to these Te Rarawa descendants in Mitimiti. \"In between here and the next valley, there's going to be sea-level rise so eventually we might have manuhiri come by waka again, like they use to,\" Bercich said. \"We need to make change and it's got to be quick,\" Simone added. Toi te kupu, toi te mana, toi te whenua. The meaning behind this proverb is that without M\u0101ori language, prestige, and land, M\u0101ori culture will cease to exist.

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images. Monday is the most significant day in New Zealand's journey to combat climate change, deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson says.\u00a0 It saw the release of the Government's first Emissions Reduction Plan which reveals how emissions will be reduced over the coming decades as the country targets net-zero by 2050. Robertson led the release at an event on Monday alongside Climate Change Minister James Shaw, Energy and Resources Minister Megan Woods, Transport Minister Michael Wood and Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern wasn't present as she's isolating at home with COVID-19. The plan contains more than 300 actions and covers transport, energy, building, agriculture, forestry, and waste. That's our entire economy and society, Robertson said, and will require collaboration from government, councils, community organisations and everyday Kiwis. Initiatives to support the purchase and lease of low-emission vehicles Require only zero-emission buses to enter fleet from 2025 and have entire fleet decarbonised by 2035 Reduce waste going to landfills and more investment in infrastructure allowing most houses to have kerbside food waste collection by 2030 Nationally integrated ticking system for public transport End reliance on coal with ban on new low-to-medium temperature coal boilers and a phase-out of existing ones by 2037 The plan will help New Zealand meet its emissions budgets, which were released last Monday , with the first budget (2022-2025) creating a ceiling of 290 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gasses. That averages out at 72.4 megatonnes per year, two megatonnes per year less than the five-year average leading up to this point and 3.1 megatonnes less than the emissions projected for between 2022 and 2025.\u00a0 The Emissions Reduction Plan shows the first budget can be met if the actions are implemented with high-impact.\u00a0 \"Meeting the first emissions budget of 290 Mt [carbon dioxide equivalent] for 2022-2025 is currently estimated to require an additional reduction of 11.5 Mt [carbon dioxide equivalent], compared with how emissions are tracking,\" the plan says. \"Baseline projected emissions are already tracking down under current policy settings. The additional emissions reductions needed to meet the first emissions budget amount to around a further 4 percent reduction.\" The plan will lead to estimated emissions reductions during the first budget period of: Forestry and waste sector reductions will also contribute. In December, the Government established the Climate Emergency Fund (CERF) with $4.5 billion, which comes from Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) revenue.\u00a0 Robertson revealed on Monday that under Budget 2022, an initial $2.9 billion is being allocated to kickstart emissions reduction. Transport is getting a big portion of that - $1.2 billion - while Energy gets about $692 million and $380 million for Agriculture. \"We expect to review the size of CEF alongside the main Budget allowances as necessary to help achieve New Zealand's climate objectives,\" the Finance Minister said. \"This initial allocation is a down payment on the action that will need to be taken over the coming decades to halt climate change.\" In a written statement, Ardern said it was a \"landmark day\" in New Zealand's transition to a low-emissions future with the release of an \"achievable\" plan.\u00a0 \"We've all seen the recent reports on sea level rise and its impact right here in New Zealand,\" she said. \"We cannot leave the issue of climate change until it's too late to fix.\" \"The Emissions Reduction Plan delivers the greatest opportunity we've had in decades to address climate change, but also move to a high-wage, low-emissions economy that provides greater economic security by creating jobs, upgrading the country to run on more clean energy, supporting nature, and improving infrastructure.\" Ardern said addressing climate change will also bring down the cost of living. \"Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels will shield households from the volatility of international price hikes while reducing transport and energy bills,\" the Prime Minister said. \"Households are already seeing the impact of escalating petrol prices and this plan sets out practical ways to cut power, transport and other costs by taking climate-friendly actions.\"", "headline": "Emissions Reduction Plan released: The key actions, numbers behind NZ's climate action", "article_name": "emissions-reduction-plan-released-the-key-actions-numbers-behind-nz-s-climate-action", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2022/05/emissions-reduction-plan-released-the-key-actions-numbers-behind-nz-s-climate-action.html", "date_published": "2022-05-16 12:00:04", "article_length": 4539, "date_uploaded": "2022-05-18T08:30:18.521858"}

{"id": null, "body": "Peter Howson, Senior Lecturer in International Development, Northumbria University, Newcastle for The Conversation Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were meant to be used as digital cash. Instead, they've become popular as speculative investments. As well as being resource-intensive and inherently wasteful, cryptocurrencies are also incredibly volatile. Prices for the largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum, have both dropped by over 55 percent in six months, leading some to suggest that regulation is needed to contain the turmoil. Some are blaming sliding prices on one specific contagion, a collapsing \"stablecoin\" called TerraUSD which is supposed to be pegged to the US dollar. But the current cryptocurrency market crash is more likely a combination of lots of factors. For years, interest rates have been close to zero, making bank bonds and treasury bills look boring as investments, while cryptocurrencies and digital non-fungible tokens (or NFTs) linked to artwork, look appealing. However, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England recently increased interest rates by the largest amount since 2000. Continuing COVID controls and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have also sobered up the markets. Bitcoin was designed to be indifferent towards governments and banks, but investors generally aren't. They're cutting sources of risk from their portfolios and dumping crypto. The most polluting \"proof-of-work\" cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, ethereum and dogecoin, together use around 300 terawatt-hours (TW/h) of mainly fossil-fuelled electricity each year. Bitcoin has an annual carbon footprint of around 114 million tonnes. That's roughly comparable to 380,000 space rocket launches, or the annual carbon footprint of the Czech Republic. Proof-of-work mining can be thought of as a controlled way of wasting energy. The process involves specialist computers repeatedly taking random shots at guessing a long string of digits. The amount of computing power dedicated to this effort is referred to as the network's hash rate. If the hash rate drops for any reason, because of power cuts or price dips, for example, the difficulty of the guessing game is automatically adjusted to ensure the network can find a new winner every ten minutes. Each winner then gets a go at verifying transactions occurring on the network and is awarded 6.25 newly minted bitcoins. Whether the guessing game is profitable or not depends on how much the mining outfit has paid to set up their computers and for the energy to run them. Most of the world's proof-of-work mining machines use electricity generated by coal-fired power stations. The higher the cryptocurrency price, the more cash mining outfits are prepared to waste on this electricity, until the costs of winning outweigh the rewards. With the bitcoin price falling, the financial incentive to waste energy for mining bitcoin should be lower. In theory, that's good for the climate. But, surprisingly, the network's hash rate (and carbon footprint) remains very close to its all-time high, averaging around 200 quintillion hashes per second. The scale of this continued interest means bitcoin mining at current prices is probably still profitable. But for how long? Bitcoin's value has temporarily dropped below the estimated cost of production several times before without significant long-term damage to the hash rate. But should the market stagnate for long enough, proof-of-work cryptocurrencies will start to see an increasing number of miners capitulate. Miners with the highest costs are likely to sell off their bitcoin holdings as profitability drops, creating even more selling pressure in the market. Short-term capitulation among smaller mining outfits with high costs (often using intermittent renewable energy) is normal. But a domino effect with major mining firms closing down one after another could cause crypto prices, and the network's carbon emissions, to drop rapidly towards zero. This event is called a bitcoin death spiral in crypto-speak. Besides bitcoin mining price predicaments, there are other potential tipping points to consider. Many big investors, especially those who bought in at higher prices, are currently underwater \u2013 weighed down with big bags of bitcoin. El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has reportedly just brought his country's total reserve of bitcoin up to around 2,300, or about US$72 million at current prices. His country's crypto losses are adding to fears of an imminent debt default that would cause significant pain to those who had no say in their leader's gamble. Prominent investors may find bitcoin bear markets a bore. But research shows the environmental losses from high-priced cryptocurrencies are far more disturbing. The damage caused by bitcoin mining disproportionately affects poor and vulnerable communities, as mining outfits and crypto developers take advantage of economic instability, weak regulations and access to cheap energy. Locals wanting to use these resources for productive purposes can be priced out by bitcoin miners. These communities also tend to face the sharp end of the climate crisis, which crypto mining fuels. Governments worldwide want to appear keen on cryptocurrencies as tools for economic growth. But the crash shows that bitcoin is both useless as a mainstream means of exchange and as a reliable store of value, bringing most users far more pain than profit. In the aftermath of the 2008-10 global financial crisis, governments promised a crackdown on toxic financial instruments with make-believe valuations. For the global climate and a stable economy, cracking down now on crypto will be a boon for everyone. But if environmental regulation efforts are not globally coordinated or far-reaching enough, crypto's climate contagion will continue to grow. \n \nTHE CONVERSATION", "headline": "Cryptocurrency price collapse offers hope for slowing climate change", "article_name": "cryptocurrency-price-collapse-offers-hope-for-slowing-climate-change", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/technology/2022/05/cryptocurrency-price-collapse-offers-hope-for-slowing-climate-change.html", "date_published": "2022-05-18 15:39:12", "article_length": 5839, "date_uploaded": "2022-05-28T08:36:49.081287"}

Credits: Video - AM; Images - AM Climate Change Minister James Shaw has defended the Government's new scrap-and-replace scheme for electric vehicles after the policy faced heavy criticism from Opposition parties.\u00a0 The Government revealed its first Emissions Reduction Plan which showed how emissions will be reduced over the coming decades as the country targets net-zero by 2050. Part of the $2.9 billion plan will be allocated towards getting Kiwis out of their gas-guzzlers and into electric vehicles. The new scrap-and-replace scheme will cost $569 million, subsidising low and middle income families to ditch their clunkers for an EV. In the new scheme, the Government would help Kiwis 'scrap' their old cars with a rebate to help buy new electric vehicles. But not all parties are happy with the idea. ACT's Climate Change spokesperson Simon Court told AM on Tuesday the scheme is \"totally unnecessary\".\u00a0 \"It's totally unnecessary in terms of carbon emissions as the Emissions Trading Scheme already puts a cap on New Zealand's transport emissions and it's also a complete waste of taxpayer money,\" Court said. But Shaw defended the $569m scheme, saying by getting lower-income households into more fuel-efficient vehicles, it will lower their living costs overall.\u00a0 \"Most New Zealanders drive second-hand cars and people on lower incomes tend to purchase the cheapest models available,\" Shaw told AM host Ryan Bridge.\u00a0 \"They tend to be by definition older and less efficient and actually very expensive to run, so whilst people might be available to afford the up-front cost of the vehicle, what happens over time is that those vehicles cost an enormous amount in both maintenance and fuel cost.\u00a0 \"So one of the things we can do to lower household living costs is to give people the ability to switch away from those kinds of vehicles. So that is the intention of the scrappage scheme that we are proposing.\" Shaw noted the scheme is starting with a trial of only 2500 vehicles, which would inform their final policy design.\u00a0 He told AM there had been examples overseas where similar schemes had worked well, but also those that hadn't been so successful. Bridge questioned Shaw, arguing the scheme seemed very expensive - but the Climate Change Minister said \"vehicles are a reasonably expensive asset\" and people could receive a rebate of between $6000 to $10,000 per vehicle. Shaw said the point of the policy is not about handing out free cash for electric cars. \"I think it's a mistake to say it's all about purchasing electric vehicles, it isn't, there are a number of other options available,\" Shaw told AM.\u00a0 \"One of the other things we are looking at is in some cases people might be able to use that to subsidise public transport or to buy e-bikes in some places where that is the best thing for them to do.\u00a0 \"But also the point is for many houses actually just getting another petrol car but one which is way more efficient would have a huge beneficial impact on their household living costs because the cost of fuel would be so much lower.\" Petrol prices in Auckland hit an all-time high of $3.15 on Thursday last week, and Shaw reiterated if lower-income families moved away from vehicles that chug through fuel, it could \"dramatically lower their household living costs\". \"If you look at second-hand [Toyota] Prius' there are thousands of them in the market at quite low prices,\" Shaw said.\u00a0 \"If you're able to just get them [Toyota Prius] into the zone where a low-income family was able to afford them, then that would perfectly suit their needs and then that would really dramatically lower their household living costs.\" Watch the full interview with James Shaw above.\u00a0", "headline": "Climate Change Minister James Shaw defends Govt's scrap-and-replace scheme for electric vehicles after ACT slams policy  ", "article_name": "climate-change-minister-james-shaw-defends-govt-s-scrap-and-replace-scheme-for-electric-vehicles-after-act-slams-policy", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2022/05/climate-change-minister-james-shaw-defends-govt-s-scrap-and-replace-scheme-for-electric-vehicles-after-act-slams-policy.html", "date_published": "2022-05-17 09:51:11", "article_length": 3784, "date_uploaded": "2022-05-28T08:36:50.745327"}

The Memorandum of Cooperation was signed in San Francisco during a meeting between Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and California governor Gavin Newsom during Ardern's official visit to the United States. \n It formalises cooperation in efforts to reduce emissions by sharing information, experiences and research, and paves the way for New Zealand and California to work together on projects that could benefit the environment. \"As the fifth largest economy in the world, California will be a significant player in the global low-emissions transition and an important partner in our efforts,\" Ardern said. \"We each have comparable broad-based plans to emissions reduction, and know it will take every sectors of our economies playing their part. We both aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century. \"Taking action on climate will secure our environment and our economy, so it makes sense to partner with allies in this shared problem.\" Minister for Climate Change James Shaw said the deal would help strengthen New Zealand's ambitions in the Emissions Reduction Plan released earlier this month . \"International engagement, like this agreement with California, will play a key role in driving domestic decarbonisation and achieving our climate targets. \"Just as New Zealand will need access to new technologies, New Zealand businesses will find new opportunities in a net-zero world and this agreement also unlocks the potential for private sector innovation and collaboration. \"In Aotearoa New Zealand we intend to continue leading by example, but the fight against climate change is a truly global effort, and only through cooperation will we deliver our shared goals and build a safer, better future for everyone,\" he said. Both California and New Zealand are tackling difficult challenges in trying to reduce emissions and environmental impacts from transport and agriculture, Ardern said. \"As a result we both have ambitious policies for zero-emission transportation on land and sea, energy innovation, clean power generation, nature-based solutions and zero waste initiatives. \"The agreement provides a framework for cooperation across a range of sectors including on zero emissions vehicles, energy storage and smart grids, emissions trading schemes, and climate smart agriculture.\" The day's line-up included Ardern and Newsom witnessing the inking of a partnership to promote the use of new US technology to enhance sustainability and reduce environmental footprints for a group of New Zealand firms and growers. The partnership was struck between the New Zealand Merino Company's ZQRX programme - a group of brands and growers that have pledged to give back to the environment - and Actual, a California tech company platform designed to help companies integrate their environmental social and governance goals into their work. NZ Merino chief executive John Brakenridge said the partnership is part of its efforts \"to reimagine the future of conscious consumerism and create products that are 'made for good', with the hope of sparking new approaches to agricultural practices worldwide. The deal includes growers on more than 2 million hectares of land, and would add to \"tangible action plans\" to benefit the environment by ZQRX brand partners like Smartwool, Allbirds, Icebreaker and Reda, he said. Ardern said businesses must play their part in work toward reducing climate change, and the partnership efforts with California provides fertile ground to help foster these efforts. \"The signing of this agreement between ZQRX and Actual is exactly the type of innovation we hope to see from the Memorandum of Cooperation, with two organizations from each respective nation, paving the way as change makers and innovators within the sustainability space.\" \u00a0 Watch the video above.", "headline": "Watch: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and California Governor sign climate change agreement", "article_name": "watch-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-and-calfiornia-governor-sign-climate-change-agreement", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2022/05/watch-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-and-calfiornia-governor-sign-climate-change-agreement.html", "date_published": "2022-05-28 11:27:00", "article_length": 4072, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-05T08:17:48.987043"}

{"id": null, "body": "Watch: The Emissions Reduction Plan was revealed in May. Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images. The partnership between Government and the primary sector has unveiled its recommendation for an alternative to the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for pricing agricultural emissions.\u00a0 It is suggesting implementing a \"farm-level, split-gas levy\" from 2025 alongside a package of incentives to support farmers in reducing their emissions.\u00a0 Under the recommended scheme, farm businesses would have to report their emissions data, devise a greenhouse gas management plan and pay levies on the amount of methane and long-lived gases emitted. A split gas approach is being recommended to reflect the different impacts methane has on the atmosphere compared to long-lived gases, with separate prices applied. Money collected through the levies would then go towards the research and development of emissions mitigation technology and practices and contribute to the cost of the system. Businesses that use approved technology or practices that deliver measurable emissions reductions - such as methane inhibitors and animal genetics - as they become available would be eligible for an incentive. They'd also be eligible for a financial offset that recognises the amount of carbon absorbed or sequestered by agreed types of vegetation on the farms. This is expected to incentivise additional methane emissions reductions of between 4 and 5.5 percent on top of the already expected reductions from current policies. Overall, current and new on-farm actions, along with reductions from the waste sector, would achieve a target of 10 percent reduction in methane by 2030, the group says. The recommendations are made by He Waka Eke Noa, a partnership between government agencies, the primary sector and iwi.\u00a0 It was established after the Government decided in 2019 to tax agricultural emissions, but the industry wanted to be involved in how this would be done. If no alternative is developed, agriculture will fall into the ETS in 2025. However, it's been proposed agriculture would receive a 95 percent discount .\u00a0 Michael Ahie, the He Waka Eke Noa chair, said the recommendations both enabled \"sustainable food and fibre production for future generations while playing a fair part in meeting our country's climate commitments\".\u00a0 \"Modelling shows the recommended system would be more effective in achieving emissions\u00a0reductions than including agriculture in the NZ ETS,\" Ahie said. \"It would also have lower impacts on production and farm profit than the NZ ETS.\" He said farmers will be able to control their own emissions \"which will incentivise behaviour change as part of an integrated farm management approach\".\u00a0 \"It would enable sustainable food production and drive efficiency, by incentivising practices and\u00a0technologies such as inhibitors and animal genetics that reduce emissions per kilogram of food, without disrupting our global competitive advantage from grass-fed systems.\" The partnership acknowledges there are challenges in building an IT system to manage individual farmers' emissions calculations over 20,000 farms. But it's confident this can be ready by 2025. The Government will now consider He Waka Eke Noa's proposal alongside advice from the Climate Change Commission before making decisions later this year on how agricultural emissions will be priced from 2025. The Ministry for the Environment and Ministry for Primary Industries, which both worked with the primary sector in developing the recommendations, will support ministers in considering the suggestions. Therefore, they aren't signatories to the report.\u00a0 Following the report's release on Wednesday morning, Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said the sector and the public will \"have the opportunity to provide their view before Cabinet makes final decisions towards the end of the year on how to effectively price emissions\". \"It's really important that we get this right. Customers around the world are demanding higher levels of sustainability in the products they buy, so there is the potential for real competitive advantage here if we can get this right and continue moving to sustainable farming systems that are ready to respond to a warming world.\" Climate Change Minister James Shaw said the agriculture sector must assist in cutting emissions.\u00a0 \"There is no question that we need to cut the amount of methane we are putting into the atmosphere, and an effective emissions pricing system for agriculture will play a key part in how we achieve that.\" But Greens agriculture spokesperson Teanau Tuiono said it's \"not clear\" how the sector's proposal will help in meeting emissions reductions targets.\u00a0 \"We know many farmers and growers want to do the right thing for the climate, but it\u2019s not clear that the sector\u2019s proposals will actually help them shift to low emissions and regenerative farming practices. \"It looks like the sector has missed an opportunity to come up with a solid plan. It\u2019s like they were given a hallway pass and used it to wag class. \"The report itself admits that further work is needed on many of its key proposals. Time is fast running out for the climate. There are only eight more lambing and calving seasons before the 2030 methane target deadline.\" The ACT Party advocates for a \"technology before tax\" view. \"We say farmers shouldn't be forced into an emissions pricing scheme, until there are credible and practical methane mitigation technologies available,\" said ACT's primary industries spokesperson Mark Cameron. \"We're pleased the Government hasn\u2019t forged ahead with a brutal tax at the processor level, but if levers aren\u2019t pulled to allow farmers to access the technology that can help them lower their emissions it will be pointless and amount to more costs on the sector that kept us afloat throughout the COVID pandemic.\" He expressed disappointment that the two ministries involved wouldn't sign the report. \"The reality is that they don\u2019t want to sign because they don\u2019t want to be held accountable.\" The Government released its Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) earlier this year , outlining the steps it will take to cut down emissions over the coming decades. More than $700 million was allocated through the Climate Emergency Response Fund to the reducing agricultural emissions, including by accelerating the development of new technologies. The plan said agricultural emissions make up 50 percent of New Zealand's gross emissions, including most nitrous oxide and biogenic methane.\u00a0 The Zero Carbon Act, passed in 2019, set a domestic target of cutting greenhouse gases (except biogenic methane) to net-zero by 2050. Biogenic methane must be cut to 24-27 percent below 2017 levels by 2050.\u00a0", "headline": "Climate change: Long-awaited recommendations for how to tax agricultural emissions revealed", "article_name": "climate-change-long-awaited-recommendations-for-how-to-tax-agricultural-emissions-revealed", "article_url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2022/06/climate-change-long-awaited-recommendations-for-how-to-tax-agricultural-emissions-revealed.html", "date_published": "2022-06-08 09:31:23", "article_length": 6734, "date_uploaded": "2022-06-12T14:04:13.747560"}

Credits: Video - AM; Image - Tair\u0101whiti Civil Defence By Hamish Cardwell for RNZ Climate change was a factor in autumn being the second-equal warmest on record, but last season also brought extreme flooding, high winds, tornados, and drought - all while a marine heatwave hurt the aquaculture industry. The season also saw a new hourly rainfall record, while it was the third hottest month of May. Niwa said temperatures were above average or well above average in every region and one factor for this was global climate change. In May dozens of locations set record or near-record temperatures. It was especially warm in Castlepoint in Wairarapa, where the mean temperature of 16.2 degrees Celsius was 3.5C higher than average. This meant the mean temperature there was closer to that expected in December (16.4C) compared to May (12.7C). In Middlemarch, Otago the average daily maximum temperature was 16.6C, which is 4.3C above normal. Numerous inland South Island places recorded average daily maximum temperatures at least 3C higher than usual for the time of year. Parts of Southland, Otago, inland Canterbury and the West Coast had mean temperatures more than 2C higher than average. The very warm air temperatures were a result of more frequent northerly airflows, ongoing warmer than average sea surface temperatures around the country, and climate change. Meanwhile, a prolonged ocean heatwave continues with record-high temperatures for April - some places up to 5 degrees hotter than normal. NZ King Salmon \u00a0has been forced to close farms and will let more than 100 staff go due to warmer water temperatures brought on by climate change. The company reported a net loss of $55.7 million in the 2022 financial year. For the first time ever there has been a\u00a0 mass bleaching \u00a0of native sea sponges in Aotearoa. The sea temperatures are almost certainly to blame, with scientists fearful for what it could mean for the entire Fiordland ecosystem. This March was the eighth warmest on record, April was the ninth warmest and May was the third warmest. Middlemarch had its driest ever autumn - with records extending back to 1896. Invercargill had a dry spell from 14-31 March, contributing to a meteorological drought in Southland. But it was the second-wettest autumn on record in Wairoa, driven by two extreme rainfall events in March and April. On 21 March rain fell in rates leading to the second wettest hour on record in the Auckland region - North Shore recorded 76.8mm of rain in an hour between 8am and 9am. At Maungatapere near Whang\u0101rei, 103mm of rain was recorded from 4am to 5am making it the new national hourly rainfall record for a low elevation station (less than 500 metres above sea level). Whang\u0101rei also observed its wettest hour on record (64.4mm) since at least January 1979. On 23 March a\u00a0 state of emergency \u00a0was declared in Tair\u0101whiti as river levels rose rapidly, causing evacuations in a number of townships, and destroying roads and bridges and cutting off some communities. There was another storm on 13 April that caused flooding again in Gisborne and in Hawke's Bay. On 20 May a woman died after being hit a by a tree brought down by wind in Cambridge, while a\u00a0 likely tornado hit Levin , damaging dozens of homes while a hailstorm in nearby \u014chau caused considerable damage to property and crops. From 8 to 9 May, heavy rainfall on the West Coast caused several large slips and surface flooding There were at least two other likely tornados in\u00a0 Waikanae \u00a0on the K\u0101piti Coast earlier this week, with rooves ripped off at least four properties. Meanwhile, according to Niwa's New Zealand Drought Monitor, meteorological drought conditions were present in southern parts of Southland and Stewart Island throughout the second half of March. Rainfall was below normal or well below normal in parts of Northland,\u00a0 Auckland , Gisborne, Hawke's Bay, Wairarapa, Canterbury (south of Christchurch), Otago and southwestern Southland. Akaroa and Matamata were New Zealand's driest locations relative to normal, with just 24 percent of normal May rainfall recorded, respectively. In Akaroa, it was the second-driest May since records began in 1977. New Zealanders should expect this winter to be warmer and wetter than average. Niwa's seasonal climate outlook forecasts warmer than average temperatures across the country this winter, alongside increased rainfall in many regions. Niwa meteorologist Ben Noll said warm seas and subtropic winds would keep the country warm throughout most of winter. Cold spells may prevent this winter from being the warmest on record, but temperatures were still trending upwards, he said. Niwa also suggests increased rainfall and moisture could indicate more floods.

One of New Zealand's most divisive political issues is back in the spotlight as the Government moves to review some aspects of our decades-old regulation on genetic modification.\u00a0 Widespread protests in the 90s and a Royal Commission in 2001 led to New Zealand adopting some of the most stringent genetic modification regulations in the world.\u00a0 \n But since then calls have mounted, including from the Climate Commission and Productivity Commission , to review our stance in light of new technologies.\u00a0 Now Environment Minister David Parker is moving on the issue.\u00a0 \"We are looking at whether some of the regulatory settings around biomedical research and laboratory research are a bit outdated,\" he told Newshub Nation. \u00a0 However the changes will be narrow and focused solely on the health sector.\u00a0 \"We're not changing the rules that would relate to the release of a genetically modified organism into the environment, for example, a plant or an animal,\" he said.\u00a0 No genetically modified organism (GMO) may leave a New Zealand laboratory without approval from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). To date only one GMO has been approved for unconditional release in New Zealand, a vaccine for horses.

We can go in and make slight new variants of key genes, and then the resulting plant is better. Coping with climate change. It could be higher nutrition. All sorts of new features.\" \n Revolutionary because of underlying advances in gene technology. Whereas older forms of modification involved imprecisely combining genes from different species, modern gene editing techniques such as CRISPR enable precise changes which can be indistinguishable from those found in nature.\u00a0 However critics of the technology argue it over promises and underdelivers, distracting from practical steps we can take now to reduce emissions - such as reducing our reliance on destructive agricultural practices. \"The time frames that it takes to develop these technologies and test them and prove them are not the timeframes we have. We need to act now on what we know will address the problem of climate change,\" Greenpeace Senior Campaigner Steve Abel told Newshub Nation.

{"id": null, "body": "Related video: Jacinda Ardern called out criticism of Mahuta on AM last week.  Credits: Image - Getty Images; Video - AM By Robert Scollay for The Conversation\u00a0 The frequent use of the term \"shared values\" to describe developments in the Pacific tends to obscure a distinct shift in New Zealand and Australian relations with their Pacific partners over the past two decades. This shift has seen a move away from ready acceptance by Pacific nations of policy prescriptions reflecting \"developed country\" priorities, towards a greater insistence on New Zealand and Australian support for policies generated by those Pacific partners themselves. This shift has now been recognised by New Zealand's foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, and more recently by Australia's new foreign minister, Penny Wong, during her visit to New Zealand last week, giving credibility to a renewed Australian focus on the \"Pacific family\". Perhaps the most obvious expression of those Pacific priorities and values relates to climate change. This existential challenge to island nations has been given the highest priority by Pacific governments, but has also been by far the most divisive factor in recent Australia and New Zealand relations with the Pacific. Successive Australian leaders have refused to consider commitments to climate change policies that Pacific countries see as critical to their long-term survival. Australian officials have worked to weaken the outcomes of international climate change conferences. Frustrated by Australia's resistance to using the Pacific Islands Forum to demand more meaningful action on climate change, Pacific countries have felt compelled to seek participation in other international groups and forums where their priorities could be unambiguously advanced. Against this background, Wong's post-election dash to Fiji was a necessary and timely \"save\". Her catch-cry of \"we have heard you and we are listening\" crucially signalled a coming change in Australia's climate change stance. A new regional convergence on climate change policy will remove a major irritant from Pacific relations and create a solid foundation for the partnership's future. But ongoing commitment by Australia and New Zealand to climate change policies that are fit for purpose will be essential for its durability.\u00a0 Fiji's evolving position has been an important factor in the widening of Pacific states' international relations. Following the 2006 coup, Fiji reacted to tensions with Australia and New Zealand by aggressively pursuing a \" Look North \" policy. It intensified trade and development partnerships with East Asian and other non-Western states (including China) and pressured other Pacific governments to follow its lead. While Fiji eventually moved away from its adversarial stance towards Australia and New Zealand, the legacy of that policy remains, in expanded connections with China and other non-Western countries. In recent years, relations between New Zealand and Fiji have been progressively normalised. This is reflected, for example, in Fiji's participation along with New Zealand and other partners in the proposed Agreement on Climate Change Trade and Sustainability ( ACCTS ). It was further cemented by New Zealand's support for Fiji's COVID vaccine rollout. In the meantime, Fiji has engaged energetically in international climate change diplomacy, positioning itself as a global champion of the Pacific's priorities. This has enhanced its leadership credentials among Pacific Island Forum members, further amplified this year by its status as forum chair. The visits to Fiji earlier this year by New Zealand cabinet ministers Peeni Henare and Nanaia Mahuta, and the resulting Duavata Declaration , reflected both the realities of the renewed partnership and the modern regional role of both countries. China's recent failure to secure Pacific nations' support for its proposed agreement on regional governance and security was greeted with relief by observers in New Zealand. But it's important to recognise that failure was also a salutary demonstration of Pacific governments' insistence that policies affecting the region must be based on decisions by those governments themselves, reflecting their own priorities. New Zealand has been wise to recognise this and allow space for regional governments to build consensus on relevant issues ahead of the coming meeting of Pacific Island Forum leaders. Looking to the future, the greatest potential contribution New Zealand can make to Pacific development lies in the expansion and broadening of labour mobility arrangements with Pacific partners. This has the added advantage that China will not realistically be able to match such arrangements. The impact of Pacific seasonal workers' absence during the pandemic highlighted their importance to the New Zealand economy. Consultation should now take place both internally and with Pacific partners to design and implement an expanded range of labour mobility arrangements that both support Pacific development aspirations and deliver an economic benefit to New Zealand. During the recent Australian election campaign, both major parties indicated their intention to move ahead on this issue. It's one area \u2013 among others \u2013 where New Zealand should not be seen to lag behind. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

{"id": null, "body": "With wild weather events, encroaching sea lines and blazing bush fires, the reality of climate change is starker every year and the consequences of inaction are growing increasingly dire.\u00a0 The Government's landmark emissions reduction plan was recently unveiled but reaching a net-zero future requires every Kiwi citizen and company being clear-eyed about necessary change and doing their part to ensure a greener future. Chorus is rising to the climate challenge by developing its own emissions reduction plan which aims to lower the company\u2019s electricity use by 25 percent over the next five years.\u00a0 \"We can't just wait for others to help us out with this challenge, we need to take action ourselves and think differently to this big problem that we're all facing,\" says Chorus Head of Sustainability Hannah Taylor.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It will come as no surprise that 92 percent of our emissions are from our electricity use across our broadband networks, so for Chorus our main focus is looking at the energy use across our networks and ensuring that we're only using the electricity that we need.\" And Hannah says Chorus is aiming to have the electricity they can't avoid using come from renewable sources instead of fossil fuels. \"We're looking at our own plan to use and create renewables. We're already using solar on small sites and a couple of our exchanges - we'll be extending that number over the next five years. We\u2019ll use this trial to understand how we could potentially be completely renewable in the future.\" Chorus is also retiring more resource intensive broadband technology, such as copper, in areas where the far faster and more efficient fibre network is available.\u00a0 Modernising New Zealand's internet infrastructure continues to play a huge role in reducing the emissions profile of our traditional infrastructure, where transport currently produces over half of our country's overall energy-related emissions.\u00a0 New Zealand's superfast fibre broadband network, built in partnership between the Government and Chorus, reaches 87 percent of the country allowing Kiwis to lessen their commute in and out of the office and be productive online from almost any location.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While we all learned the value of being able to work remotely during the past two years, as the acute crisis of COVID-19 fades and the slower moving crisis of climate change comes to the foreground, the same adaptations we made for the pandemic can be expanded upon.\u00a0 Of course, no-one wants to just trade emissions from one source for another, so Chorus teamed up with other climate conscious fibre companies to study the carbon footprint of their technologies and found that fibre's emissions stayed low even as its usage increased. \"Whereas in other technologies, you see emissions go up as more data and more speed is put through the network. So that gave us a lot of assurance that fibre is the right thing for the future,\" says Hannah. Fibre's ability to scale up while staying green is particularly important since New Zealanders have shown a near insatiable appetite for data over the last decade.\u00a0 \"Back in 2011, the average household data usage was just ten gigabytes (GB) a month, which isn't really that much data when you think about it. Now, a decade later, we're at an average of 500 GB per household, a 50-fold increase,\" says Hannah.\u00a0\u00a0 While the fibre network already delivers blistering speeds of up to eight gigabits per second, that's in no way the upper limit of what the network is capable of and as the needs of business and consumers continue to grow, the underlying infrastructure will unlock further speeds to keep pace. The increase in data use is reflective of a broader shift in the global economy from producing value through tangible assets towards intangible ones i.e. from the ICT sector instead of extractive industries such as mining.\u00a0 New Zealand's level broadband access means we are well placed to be world leaders in the growing digital economy and reap the environmental benefits. There is a hard limit on how many cows we can cram per hectare of land but there is no ceiling on the amount of code we can export; all facilitated by the fibre network.\u00a0 However, as the economy becomes increasingly digital, it's imperative all New Zealanders are brought along for the journey. Hannah acknowledges that there is still work to be done to ensure every Kiwi, particularly those in rural areas, have access to the high-speed internet. \"I think New Zealand has a bit of work to do in order to say with our hand on heart that we have reached digital equity but I think given our size, it's not unachievable.\" While questions of climate change and the potential catastrophes can be overwhelming and anxiety-inducing, Hannah advises slowing down and focusing on what\u2019s in your control. \u00a0 \"Taking a step back and asking: What can we do together?
